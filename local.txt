95𓀴How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in
96𓀴the reading of them. All needless matters have been eliminated, so that
97𓀴a history almost at variance with the possibilities of later-day belief
98𓀴may stand forth as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of
99𓀴past things wherein memory may err, for all the records chosen are
100𓀴exactly contemporary, given from the standpoints and within the range
101𓀴of knowledge of those who made them.

118𓀴_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
119𓀴Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
120𓀴hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
121𓀴got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
122𓀴streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
123𓀴late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
124𓀴impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
125𓀴East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
126𓀴here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
127𓀴rule.
128𓀴
129𓀴We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
130𓀴Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
131𓀴rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
132𓀴very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
133𓀴waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
134𓀴national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
135𓀴Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
136𓀴don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.
137𓀴
138𓀴Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
139𓀴British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
140𓀴regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
141𓀴country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
142𓀴nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
143𓀴extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
144𓀴Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
145𓀴mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
146𓀴not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
147𓀴Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
148𓀴with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
149𓀴town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
150𓀴here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
151𓀴travels with Mina.
152𓀴
153𓀴In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
154𓀴Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
155𓀴descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
156𓀴East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
157𓀴from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
158𓀴the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
159𓀴read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
160𓀴horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
161𓀴imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I
162𓀴must ask the Count all about them.)
163𓀴
164𓀴I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
165𓀴all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
166𓀴window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
167𓀴the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
168𓀴still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
169𓀴knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
170𓀴I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
171𓀴which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
172𓀴very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_Mem._, get recipe
173𓀴for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
174𓀴before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
175𓀴the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
176𓀴before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
177𓀴more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?
178𓀴
179𓀴All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
180𓀴beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
181𓀴top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
182𓀴rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
183𓀴of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
184𓀴running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
185𓀴station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
186𓀴of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
187𓀴saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
188𓀴and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
189𓀴looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
190𓀴about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
191𓀴and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
192𓀴fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
193𓀴were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
194𓀴Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
195𓀴hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
196𓀴heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
197𓀴nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
198𓀴had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
199𓀴picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
200𓀴set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
201𓀴however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
202𓀴self-assertion.
203𓀴
204𓀴It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
205𓀴very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
206𓀴Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
207𓀴existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
208𓀴of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
209𓀴occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
210𓀴a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
211𓀴proper being assisted by famine and disease.
212𓀴
213𓀴Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
214𓀴found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
215𓀴course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
216𓀴evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
217𓀴cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
218𓀴undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
219𓀴fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
220𓀴said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She
221𓀴smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
222𓀴who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
223𓀴a letter:--
224𓀴
225𓀴     “My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
226𓀴     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
227𓀴     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
228𓀴     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
229𓀴     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
230𓀴     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
231𓀴
232𓀴“Your friend,
233𓀴
234𓀴“DRACULA.”
235𓀴
236𓀴
237𓀴_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
238𓀴directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
239𓀴making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
240𓀴pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
241𓀴true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
242𓀴answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
243𓀴lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
244𓀴way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
245𓀴was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
246𓀴tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
247𓀴and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
248𓀴further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
249𓀴any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
250𓀴comforting.
251𓀴
252𓀴Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
253𓀴very hysterical way:
254𓀴
255𓀴“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited
256𓀴state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
257𓀴mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
258𓀴was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
259𓀴that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
260𓀴she asked again:
261𓀴
262𓀴“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.
263𓀴She shook her head as she said again:
264𓀴
265𓀴“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On
266𓀴my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
267𓀴
268𓀴“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
269𓀴the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
270𓀴full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
271𓀴She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
272𓀴without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
273𓀴to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
274𓀴ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
275𓀴to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
276𓀴tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
277𓀴her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
278𓀴dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
279𓀴did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
280𓀴taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
281𓀴seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
282𓀴state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
283𓀴rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out
284𓀴of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
285𓀴for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
286𓀴round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly
287𓀴traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
288𓀴am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
289𓀴ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
290𓀴coach!
291𓀴

293𓀴
294𓀴_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
295𓀴high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
296𓀴hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
297𓀴mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
298𓀴naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
299𓀴down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
300𓀴left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
301𓀴called “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
302𓀴pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
303𓀴style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
304𓀴produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
305𓀴disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
306𓀴
307𓀴When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
308𓀴talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
309𓀴now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
310𓀴on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning
311𓀴“word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
312𓀴pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
313𓀴there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
314𓀴dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
315𓀴cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell,
316𓀴“stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same
317𓀴thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
318𓀴either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these
319𓀴superstitions)
320𓀴
321𓀴When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
322𓀴swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
323𓀴pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
324𓀴fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
325𓀴first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
326𓀴charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
327𓀴just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
328𓀴seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
329𓀴could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
330𓀴had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
331𓀴themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
332𓀴rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
333𓀴centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
334𓀴the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big
335𓀴whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
336𓀴our journey.
337𓀴
338𓀴I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
339𓀴scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
340𓀴languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
341𓀴been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
342𓀴land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
343𓀴with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
344𓀴road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
345𓀴plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
346𓀴the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
347𓀴green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,
348𓀴losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
349𓀴straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
350𓀴hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
351𓀴seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
352𓀴what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
353𓀴time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
354𓀴excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
355𓀴snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
356𓀴the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
357𓀴in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
358𓀴Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
359𓀴and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
360𓀴
361𓀴Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
362𓀴of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
363𓀴and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
364𓀴them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
365𓀴deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
366𓀴grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
367𓀴pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
368𓀴the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
369𓀴mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
370𓀴the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
371𓀴we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
372𓀴peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
373𓀴be right before us:--
374𓀴
375𓀴“Look! Isten szek!”--“God’s seat!”--and he crossed himself reverently.
376𓀴
377𓀴As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
378𓀴us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
379𓀴emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
380𓀴sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
381𓀴we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
382𓀴that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
383𓀴and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
384𓀴was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
385𓀴turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
386𓀴devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
387𓀴many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
388𓀴and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
389𓀴shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
390𓀴again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
391𓀴long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
392𓀴road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
393𓀴peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
394𓀴coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
395𓀴staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
396𓀴and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
397𓀴gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
398𓀴ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
399𓀴Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
400𓀴late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
401𓀴that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
402𓀴greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
403𓀴peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
404𓀴grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
405𓀴threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
406𓀴Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
407𓀴hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
408𓀴only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
409𓀴but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not
410𓀴walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he
411𓀴evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the
412𓀴approving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters
413𓀴before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s
414𓀴pause to light his lamps.
415𓀴
416𓀴When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
417𓀴passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
418𓀴though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
419𓀴with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
420𓀴to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
421𓀴patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
422𓀴hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
423𓀴rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
424𓀴stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
425𓀴to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
426𓀴side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
427𓀴by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
428𓀴upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
429𓀴certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
430𓀴faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
431𓀴fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
432𓀴Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
433𓀴Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
434𓀴passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
435𓀴darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
436𓀴happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
437𓀴give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
438𓀴some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
439𓀴the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
440𓀴air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
441𓀴mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
442𓀴into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
443𓀴which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
444𓀴glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
445𓀴was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
446𓀴hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
447𓀴road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
448𓀴The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
449𓀴my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
450𓀴the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
451𓀴could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
452𓀴thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said
453𓀴in German worse than my own:--
454𓀴
455𓀴“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
456𓀴now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
457𓀴the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
458𓀴snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
459𓀴amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
460𓀴of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
461𓀴us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
462𓀴lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
463𓀴splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
464𓀴beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
465𓀴could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
466𓀴in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--
467𓀴
468𓀴“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:--
469𓀴
470𓀴“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--
471𓀴
472𓀴“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
473𓀴deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he
474𓀴spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
475𓀴very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
476𓀴companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:--
477𓀴
478𓀴    “Denn die Todten reiten schnell”--
479𓀴    (“For the dead travel fast.”)
480𓀴
481𓀴The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
482𓀴gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
483𓀴putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s
484𓀴luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
485𓀴handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the
486𓀴coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
487𓀴hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
488𓀴prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
489𓀴swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
490𓀴from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
491𓀴against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
492𓀴the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
493𓀴on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
494𓀴strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
495𓀴over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
496𓀴excellent German:--
497𓀴
498𓀴“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
499𓀴care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
500𓀴country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take
501𓀴any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
502𓀴little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
503𓀴any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
504𓀴unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
505𓀴then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
506𓀴seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
507𓀴again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
508𓀴so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
509𓀴I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
510𓀴protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
511𓀴delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
512𓀴passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
513𓀴within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
514𓀴suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
515𓀴recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.
516𓀴
517𓀴Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a
518𓀴long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
519𓀴another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
520𓀴now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
521𓀴to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
522𓀴it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
523𓀴strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
524𓀴quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
525𓀴sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
526𓀴side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which
527𓀴affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to
528𓀴jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
529𓀴madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
530𓀴from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
531𓀴the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
532𓀴to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
533𓀴whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
534𓀴doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
535𓀴quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
536𓀴took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
537𓀴time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
538𓀴narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
539𓀴
540𓀴Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
541𓀴roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
542𓀴rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
543𓀴could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
544𓀴rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
545𓀴It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
546𓀴so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
547𓀴keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
548𓀴fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
549𓀴and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
550𓀴grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
551𓀴however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
552𓀴left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.
553𓀴
554𓀴Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
555𓀴driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
556𓀴jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
557𓀴what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
558𓀴I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
559𓀴his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
560𓀴and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
561𓀴endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
562𓀴Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
563𓀴around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where
564𓀴the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
565𓀴to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,
566𓀴formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
567𓀴effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
568𓀴for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
569𓀴as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
570𓀴straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
571𓀴flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
572𓀴wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.
573𓀴
574𓀴At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
575𓀴had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
576𓀴than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
577𓀴for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
578𓀴then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
579𓀴jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
580𓀴around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
581𓀴with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
582𓀴terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
583𓀴For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
584𓀴feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
585𓀴their true import.
586𓀴
587𓀴All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
588𓀴some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
589𓀴looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
590𓀴but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
591𓀴had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
592𓀴it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
593𓀴ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
594𓀴calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
595𓀴to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
596𓀴not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
597𓀴looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
598𓀴long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
599𓀴fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
600𓀴the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
601𓀴
602𓀴When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
603𓀴wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
604𓀴dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
605𓀴seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
606𓀴darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
607𓀴ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
608𓀴always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
609𓀴driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
610𓀴vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
611𓀴and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
612𓀴sky.

617𓀴CHAPTER II
618𓀴
619𓀴JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_
620𓀴
621𓀴
622𓀴_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
623𓀴awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
624𓀴the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
625𓀴ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
626𓀴it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
627𓀴
628𓀴When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
629𓀴to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
630𓀴strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
631𓀴crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
632𓀴them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
633𓀴studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
634𓀴massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
635𓀴massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
636𓀴weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
637𓀴reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
638𓀴of the dark openings.
639𓀴
640𓀴I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
641𓀴or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
642𓀴window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
643𓀴time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
644𓀴me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
645𓀴What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
646𓀴customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to
647𓀴explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s
648𓀴clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving
649𓀴London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
650𓀴full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
651𓀴I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
652𓀴expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
653𓀴the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
654𓀴in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
655𓀴pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
656𓀴and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
657𓀴wait the coming of the morning.
658𓀴
659𓀴Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
660𓀴behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
661𓀴light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
662𓀴massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
663𓀴of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
664𓀴
665𓀴Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
666𓀴moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
667𓀴of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
668𓀴lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
669𓀴throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
670𓀴open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
671𓀴gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--
672𓀴
673𓀴“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no
674𓀴motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
675𓀴gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
676𓀴I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
677𓀴holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
678𓀴an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
679𓀴ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--
680𓀴
681𓀴“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
682𓀴happiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
683𓀴that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
684𓀴for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
685𓀴speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--
686𓀴
687𓀴“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--
688𓀴
689𓀴“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
690𓀴the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was
691𓀴speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
692𓀴took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
693𓀴protested but he insisted:--
694𓀴
695𓀴“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
696𓀴available. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying
697𓀴my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
698𓀴along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
699𓀴heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
700𓀴to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
701𓀴and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
702𓀴flamed and flared.
703𓀴
704𓀴The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
705𓀴the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
706𓀴by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
707𓀴through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
708𓀴welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
709𓀴another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
710𓀴fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
711𓀴left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
712𓀴door:--
713𓀴
714𓀴“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
715𓀴toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
716𓀴into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”
717𓀴
718𓀴The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have
719𓀴dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
720𓀴I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
721𓀴toilet, I went into the other room.
722𓀴
723𓀴I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
724𓀴great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
725𓀴his hand to the table, and said:--
726𓀴
727𓀴“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
728𓀴me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”
729𓀴
730𓀴I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
731𓀴He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
732𓀴it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
733𓀴pleasure.
734𓀴
735𓀴“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
736𓀴sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
737𓀴come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
738𓀴whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
739𓀴and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
740𓀴discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
741𓀴be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
742𓀴your instructions in all matters.”
743𓀴
744𓀴The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
745𓀴fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
746𓀴and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
747𓀴my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
748𓀴questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
749𓀴experienced.
750𓀴
751𓀴By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn
752𓀴up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
753𓀴at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
754𓀴opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
755𓀴physiognomy.
756𓀴
757𓀴His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
758𓀴thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
759𓀴hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
760𓀴eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
761𓀴hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
762𓀴could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
763𓀴cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
764𓀴the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
765𓀴man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
766𓀴extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
767𓀴though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
768𓀴
769𓀴Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
770𓀴in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
771𓀴them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
772𓀴coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
773𓀴the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
774𓀴point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
775𓀴repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
776𓀴horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
777𓀴not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
778𓀴grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
779𓀴protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
780𓀴fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
781𓀴window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
782𓀴strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
783𓀴down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes
784𓀴gleamed, and he said:--
785𓀴
786𓀴“Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!”
787𓀴Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
788𓀴added:--
789𓀴
790𓀴“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
791𓀴hunter.” Then he rose and said:--
792𓀴
793𓀴“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
794𓀴shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
795𓀴so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me
796𓀴himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....
797𓀴
798𓀴I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
799𓀴which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
800𓀴sake of those dear to me!
801𓀴
802𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
803𓀴
804𓀴_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
805𓀴last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
806𓀴own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
807𓀴supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
808𓀴pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
809𓀴was written:--
810𓀴
811𓀴“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.” I set to and
812𓀴enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
813𓀴might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
814𓀴There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
815𓀴extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
816𓀴is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
817𓀴The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
818𓀴my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
819𓀴been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
820𓀴though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
821𓀴but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
822𓀴the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
823𓀴table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
824𓀴could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
825𓀴anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
826𓀴Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it
827𓀴breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I had
828𓀴it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
829𓀴the castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There was
830𓀴absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
831𓀴materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
832𓀴library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.
833𓀴
834𓀴In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
835𓀴books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
836𓀴newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
837𓀴and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
838𓀴were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
839𓀴economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life
840𓀴and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
841𓀴London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the
842𓀴Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
843𓀴Law List.
844𓀴
845𓀴Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
846𓀴entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
847𓀴night’s rest. Then he went on:--
848𓀴
849𓀴“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
850𓀴will interest you. These companions”--and he laid his hand on some of
851𓀴the books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
852𓀴since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
853𓀴of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
854𓀴know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
855𓀴your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
856𓀴humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
857𓀴it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
858𓀴To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”
859𓀴
860𓀴“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed
861𓀴gravely.
862𓀴
863𓀴“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
864𓀴fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
865𓀴the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”
866𓀴
867𓀴“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”
868𓀴
869𓀴“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
870𓀴London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
871𓀴enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
872𓀴and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
873𓀴know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
874𓀴like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
875𓀴speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long
876𓀴master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should
877𓀴be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
878𓀴Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
879𓀴shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
880𓀴learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
881𓀴error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
882𓀴away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
883𓀴important affairs in hand.”
884𓀴
885𓀴Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
886𓀴come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and
887𓀴added:--
888𓀴
889𓀴“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
890𓀴locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
891𓀴all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
892𓀴my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of
893𓀴this, and then he went on:--
894𓀴
895𓀴“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
896𓀴not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
897𓀴what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
898𓀴what strange things there may be.”
899𓀴
900𓀴This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
901𓀴talk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding
902𓀴things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
903𓀴Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
904𓀴pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
905𓀴frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
906𓀴him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
907𓀴instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
908𓀴flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
909𓀴certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
910𓀴are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
911𓀴where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he
912𓀴went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be
913𓀴but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
914𓀴Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
915𓀴in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
916𓀴patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
917𓀴Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
918𓀴to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
919𓀴their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
920𓀴destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
921𓀴was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
922𓀴sheltered in the friendly soil.”
923𓀴
924𓀴“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
925𓀴there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”
926𓀴The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
927𓀴sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--
928𓀴
929𓀴“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
930𓀴appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
931𓀴can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
932𓀴would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
933𓀴marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
934𓀴even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
935𓀴find these places again?”
936𓀴
937𓀴“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even
938𓀴to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.
939𓀴
940𓀴“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you
941𓀴have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
942𓀴own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
943𓀴order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
944𓀴passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
945𓀴lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
946𓀴in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
947𓀴reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I
948𓀴came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
949𓀴went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
950𓀴everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
951𓀴surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
952𓀴subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
953𓀴more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--
954𓀴
955𓀴“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
956𓀴I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I
957𓀴fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
958𓀴Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
959𓀴in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
960𓀴other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”
961𓀴
962𓀴We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
963𓀴Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
964𓀴necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
965𓀴Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
966𓀴place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
967𓀴inscribe here:--
968𓀴
969𓀴“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
970𓀴be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
971𓀴was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
972𓀴built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
973𓀴years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
974𓀴rust.
975𓀴
976𓀴“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre
977𓀴Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
978𓀴the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
979𓀴the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
980𓀴make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
981𓀴small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
982𓀴flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
983𓀴periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
984𓀴immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
985𓀴iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
986𓀴church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
987𓀴to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
988𓀴various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
989𓀴way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
990𓀴be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
991𓀴large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
992𓀴asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”
993𓀴
994𓀴When I had finished, he said:--
995𓀴
996𓀴“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
997𓀴live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
998𓀴day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
999𓀴also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
1000𓀴not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
1001𓀴gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
1002𓀴sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
1003𓀴and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
1004𓀴attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
1005𓀴shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
1006𓀴battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
1007𓀴be alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look
1008𓀴did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
1009𓀴smile look malignant and saturnine.
1010𓀴
1011𓀴Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
1012𓀴together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
1013𓀴the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
1014𓀴England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
1015𓀴certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
1016𓀴that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
1017𓀴estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
1018𓀴Yorkshire coast.
1019𓀴
1020𓀴It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he
1021𓀴said; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
1022𓀴am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into
1023𓀴the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
1024𓀴Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
1025𓀴home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
1026𓀴After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
1027𓀴me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
1028𓀴after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
1029𓀴say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in
1030𓀴every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
1031𓀴me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
1032𓀴the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
1033𓀴They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
1034𓀴the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
1035𓀴tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
1036𓀴can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
1037𓀴with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
1038𓀴Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--
1039𓀴
1040𓀴“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
1041𓀴long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
1042𓀴England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
1043𓀴us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.
1044𓀴
1045𓀴I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
1046𓀴notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
1047𓀴warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
1048𓀴written of this day.
1049𓀴
1050𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1051𓀴
1052𓀴_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
1053𓀴diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
1054𓀴there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
1055𓀴cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
1056𓀴never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
1057𓀴me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
1058𓀴could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
1059𓀴and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
1060𓀴me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
1061𓀴imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
1062𓀴at once how I stand--or seem to.
1063𓀴
1064𓀴I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
1065𓀴not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
1066𓀴and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
1067𓀴and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for
1068𓀴it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
1069𓀴covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
1070𓀴but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s
1071𓀴salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
1072𓀴This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
1073𓀴could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
1074𓀴the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
1075𓀴sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
1076𓀴the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
1077𓀴feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
1078𓀴the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
1079𓀴trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
1080𓀴round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
1081𓀴eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
1082𓀴my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
1083𓀴held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
1084𓀴so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.
1085𓀴
1086𓀴“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more
1087𓀴dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving
1088𓀴glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the
1089𓀴mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and
1090𓀴opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
1091𓀴out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
1092𓀴of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
1093𓀴annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
1094𓀴the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
1095𓀴
1096𓀴When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
1097𓀴not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
1098𓀴as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
1099𓀴peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
1100𓀴went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
1101𓀴view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
1102𓀴of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
1103𓀴stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
1104𓀴touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
1105𓀴tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
1106𓀴there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
1107𓀴the forests.
1108𓀴
1109𓀴But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
1110𓀴explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
1111𓀴bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
1112𓀴an available exit.
1113𓀴
1114𓀴The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!

1121𓀴JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_
1122𓀴
1123𓀴
1124𓀴When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
1125𓀴I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
1126𓀴every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
1127𓀴helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
1128𓀴few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
1129𓀴as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
1130𓀴that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done
1131𓀴anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I
1132𓀴am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
1133𓀴one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
1134𓀴the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
1135𓀴himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
1136𓀴me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
1137𓀴plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
1138𓀴open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
1139𓀴or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
1140𓀴shall need, all my brains to get through.
1141𓀴
1142𓀴I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
1143𓀴shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
1144𓀴the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
1145𓀴the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
1146𓀴thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
1147𓀴through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
1148𓀴dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
1149𓀴menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
1150𓀴This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
1151𓀴must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
1152𓀴brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
1153𓀴mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
1154𓀴hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
1155𓀴coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
1156𓀴crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
1157𓀴that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
1158𓀴comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
1159𓀴which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
1160𓀴should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
1161𓀴is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
1162𓀴a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
1163𓀴time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
1164𓀴mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
1165𓀴Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
1166𓀴himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
1167𓀴however, not to awake his suspicion.

1170𓀴
1171𓀴_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
1172𓀴questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
1173𓀴wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
1174𓀴battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
1175𓀴afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house
1176𓀴and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
1177𓀴fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”
1178𓀴and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
1179𓀴down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
1180𓀴fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
1181𓀴grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
1182𓀴white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
1183𓀴though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
1184𓀴shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
1185𓀴his race:--
1186𓀴
1187𓀴“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
1188𓀴of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
1189𓀴in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
1190𓀴Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
1191𓀴Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
1192𓀴and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
1193𓀴were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
1194𓀴the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
1195𓀴till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
1196𓀴old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
1197𓀴desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
1198𓀴Attila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a
1199𓀴wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
1200𓀴Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
1201𓀴thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
1202𓀴Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
1203𓀴here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
1204𓀴there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
1205𓀴claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
1206𓀴was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more
1207𓀴than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
1208𓀴‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we
1209𓀴throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its
1210𓀴warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
1211𓀴redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
1212𓀴flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
1213𓀴was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
1214𓀴the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
1215𓀴his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
1216𓀴Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
1217𓀴indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
1218𓀴again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,
1219𓀴when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
1220𓀴to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
1221𓀴slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
1222𓀴said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
1223𓀴without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
1224𓀴conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the
1225𓀴Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
1226𓀴our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
1227𓀴Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and
1228𓀴their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
1229𓀴Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
1230𓀴Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
1231𓀴the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”
1232𓀴
1233𓀴It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this
1234𓀴diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for
1235𓀴everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet’s
1236𓀴father.)

1239𓀴
1240𓀴_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
1241𓀴books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
1242𓀴confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
1243𓀴observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
1244𓀴his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
1245𓀴doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
1246𓀴books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
1247𓀴matters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain
1248𓀴method in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
1249𓀴sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
1250𓀴
1251𓀴First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
1252𓀴told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
1253𓀴wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
1254𓀴one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
1255𓀴against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
1256𓀴ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
1257𓀴attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
1258𓀴local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
1259𓀴solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
1260𓀴chance mislead him, so he said:--
1261𓀴
1262𓀴“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
1263𓀴the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
1264𓀴London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
1265𓀴here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
1266𓀴sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
1267𓀴resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
1268𓀴served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
1269𓀴have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
1270𓀴seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
1271𓀴I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
1272𓀴Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
1273𓀴ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that
1274𓀴certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
1275𓀴agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
1276𓀴instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
1277𓀴himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
1278𓀴him without further trouble.
1279𓀴
1280𓀴“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”
1281𓀴
1282𓀴“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who
1283𓀴do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”
1284𓀴
1285𓀴“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
1286𓀴consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
1287𓀴difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
1288𓀴against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
1289𓀴and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
1290𓀴wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
1291𓀴foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
1292𓀴evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
1293𓀴wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
1294𓀴spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
1295𓀴available, he suddenly stood up and said:--
1296𓀴
1297𓀴“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
1298𓀴Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that
1299𓀴I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
1300𓀴sending letters to anybody.
1301𓀴
1302𓀴“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my
1303𓀴shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
1304𓀴please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”
1305𓀴
1306𓀴“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
1307𓀴thought.
1308𓀴
1309𓀴“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
1310𓀴employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
1311𓀴it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
1312𓀴stinted. Is it not so?”
1313𓀴
1314𓀴What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not
1315𓀴mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
1316𓀴Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
1317𓀴which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
1318𓀴could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
1319𓀴mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
1320𓀴in his own smooth, resistless way:--
1321𓀴
1322𓀴“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
1323𓀴other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
1324𓀴friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
1325𓀴home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
1326𓀴note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
1327𓀴post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
1328𓀴with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
1329𓀴as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
1330𓀴he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
1331𓀴now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
1332𓀴to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
1333𓀴did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
1334𓀴book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
1335𓀴some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
1336𓀴own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
1337𓀴had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
1338𓀴were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
1339𓀴under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
1340𓀴I could.
1341𓀴
1342𓀴One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
1343𓀴Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
1344𓀴Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
1345𓀴bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
1346𓀴about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my
1347𓀴seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
1348𓀴to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
1349𓀴hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
1350𓀴them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--
1351𓀴
1352𓀴“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
1353𓀴evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door he
1354𓀴turned, and after a moment’s pause said:--
1355𓀴
1356𓀴“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all
1357𓀴seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
1358𓀴chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
1359𓀴many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
1360𓀴warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
1361𓀴haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
1362𓀴safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished his
1363𓀴speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
1364𓀴washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
1365𓀴dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
1366𓀴and mystery which seemed closing around me.
1367𓀴
1368𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1369𓀴
1370𓀴_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
1371𓀴doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
1372𓀴not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that
1373𓀴my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
1374𓀴
1375𓀴When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
1376𓀴sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
1377𓀴towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
1378𓀴inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
1379𓀴of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
1380𓀴prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
1381𓀴the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
1382𓀴It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
1383𓀴sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
1384𓀴terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
1385𓀴expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
1386𓀴day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
1387𓀴in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
1388𓀴to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
1389𓀴leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
1390𓀴below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
1391𓀴the rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The
1392𓀴window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
1393𓀴weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
1394𓀴the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
1395𓀴carefully out.
1396𓀴
1397𓀴What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not
1398𓀴see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
1399𓀴back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
1400𓀴so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
1401𓀴somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
1402𓀴and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
1403𓀴repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
1404𓀴window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
1405𓀴_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
1406𓀴first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
1407𓀴moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
1408𓀴be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
1409𓀴stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
1410𓀴using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
1411𓀴speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.
1412𓀴
1413𓀴What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
1414𓀴semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
1415𓀴me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am
1416𓀴encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....
1417𓀴

1419𓀴
1420𓀴_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
1421𓀴He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
1422𓀴deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
1423𓀴had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
1424𓀴avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
1425𓀴knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
1426𓀴explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
1427𓀴taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
1428𓀴expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
1429𓀴stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
1430𓀴pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
1431𓀴door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s
1432𓀴room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
1433𓀴escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
1434𓀴and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
1435𓀴small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
1436𓀴them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,
1437𓀴however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
1438𓀴seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
1439𓀴and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
1440𓀴from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
1441𓀴rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
1442𓀴again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
1443𓀴I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
1444𓀴than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
1445𓀴see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
1446𓀴windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
1447𓀴side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
1448𓀴was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
1449𓀴quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
1450𓀴bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
1451𓀴impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
1452𓀴west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
1453𓀴mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
1454𓀴mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
1455𓀴crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
1456𓀴occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
1457𓀴comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
1458𓀴yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
1459𓀴see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
1460𓀴all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
1461𓀴lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
1462𓀴glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
1463𓀴which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
1464𓀴than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
1465𓀴presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
1466𓀴found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
1467𓀴table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
1468𓀴thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
1469𓀴diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
1470𓀴nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
1471𓀴senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
1472𓀴which mere “modernity” cannot kill.

1476𓀴_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I
1477𓀴am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
1478𓀴Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
1479𓀴go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
1480𓀴is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
1481𓀴hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
1482𓀴can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
1483𓀴purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
1484𓀴lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
1485𓀴have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
1486𓀴when he made Hamlet say:--
1487𓀴
1488𓀴    “My tablets! quick, my tablets!
1489𓀴    ’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,
1490𓀴
1491𓀴for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
1492𓀴had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
1493𓀴The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
1494𓀴
1495𓀴The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
1496𓀴me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
1497𓀴me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!
1498𓀴
1499𓀴When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
1500𓀴pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind,
1501𓀴but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
1502𓀴and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
1503𓀴moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
1504𓀴which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
1505𓀴gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
1506𓀴and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
1507𓀴their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
1508𓀴couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
1509𓀴at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
1510𓀴the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
1511𓀴asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
1512𓀴real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
1513𓀴morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
1514𓀴
1515𓀴I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
1516𓀴came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
1517𓀴my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
1518𓀴dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
1519𓀴their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
1520𓀴when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
1521𓀴no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
1522𓀴time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
1523𓀴noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
1524𓀴almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
1525𓀴fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
1526𓀴like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
1527𓀴in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
1528𓀴moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
1529𓀴pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
1530𓀴about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
1531𓀴deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
1532𓀴kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
1533𓀴day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
1534𓀴They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
1535𓀴silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
1536𓀴come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
1537𓀴tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
1538𓀴The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
1539𓀴on. One said:--
1540𓀴
1541𓀴“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
1542𓀴begin.” The other added:--
1543𓀴
1544𓀴“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,
1545𓀴looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
1546𓀴The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
1547𓀴of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
1548𓀴the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
1549𓀴underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
1550𓀴
1551𓀴I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
1552𓀴the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
1553𓀴gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
1554𓀴and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
1555𓀴like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
1556𓀴on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
1557𓀴teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
1558𓀴my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
1559𓀴paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
1560𓀴her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
1561𓀴skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that
1562𓀴is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,
1563𓀴shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
1564𓀴and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
1565𓀴I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
1566𓀴heart.
1567𓀴
1568𓀴But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
1569𓀴lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
1570𓀴being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
1571𓀴saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
1572𓀴giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
1573𓀴white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
1574𓀴passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
1575𓀴the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
1576𓀴in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His
1577𓀴face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
1578𓀴the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
1579𓀴of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
1580𓀴from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
1581𓀴them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
1582𓀴wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
1583𓀴cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--
1584𓀴
1585𓀴“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
1586𓀴I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
1587𓀴how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,
1588𓀴with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--
1589𓀴
1590𓀴“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women
1591𓀴joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
1592𓀴room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
1593𓀴of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
1594𓀴and said in a soft whisper:--
1595𓀴
1596𓀴“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
1597𓀴not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
1598𓀴kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
1599𓀴to be done.”
1600𓀴
1601𓀴“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,
1602𓀴as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
1603𓀴moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
1604𓀴nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
1605𓀴ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
1606𓀴half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
1607𓀴horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
1608𓀴bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
1609𓀴without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
1610𓀴moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
1611𓀴dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.
1612𓀴
1613𓀴Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.

1622𓀴
1623𓀴I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
1624𓀴have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
1625𓀴could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
1626𓀴certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
1627𓀴in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
1628𓀴rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
1629𓀴many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
1630𓀴evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
1631𓀴another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
1632𓀴thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
1633𓀴me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
1634𓀴am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
1635𓀴have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
1636𓀴room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
1637𓀴sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
1638𓀴were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.

1641𓀴
1642𓀴_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
1643𓀴I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
1644𓀴stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
1645𓀴jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
1646𓀴of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
1647𓀴I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.

1650𓀴
1651𓀴_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
1652𓀴the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
1653𓀴was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
1654𓀴another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
1655𓀴letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
1656𓀴Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
1657𓀴of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
1658𓀴am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
1659𓀴suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
1660𓀴that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
1661𓀴prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
1662𓀴chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
1663𓀴which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
1664𓀴to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
1665𓀴ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
1666𓀴impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
1667𓀴be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
1668𓀴prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
1669𓀴suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
1670𓀴him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
1671𓀴then said:--
1672𓀴
1673𓀴“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
1674𓀴29.”
1675𓀴
1676𓀴I know now the span of my life. God help me!

1679𓀴
1680𓀴_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
1681𓀴send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
1682𓀴encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
1683𓀴them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
1684𓀴allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
1685𓀴of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
1686𓀴They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
1687𓀴call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
1688𓀴save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
1689𓀴tongue.
1690𓀴
1691𓀴I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
1692𓀴posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
1693𓀴acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
1694𓀴signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
1695𓀴their spoken language....

1698𓀴
1699𓀴I have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
1700𓀴Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
1701𓀴but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
1702𓀴frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
1703𓀴letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
1704𓀴extent of my knowledge....

1707𓀴
1708𓀴I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
1709𓀴with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
1710𓀴man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
1711𓀴in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
1712𓀴read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....

1716𓀴The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
1717𓀴voice as he opened two letters:--
1718𓀴
1719𓀴“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
1720𓀴come, I shall, of course, take care. See!”--he must have looked at
1721𓀴it--“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”--here
1722𓀴he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
1723𓀴the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“the
1724𓀴other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
1725𓀴not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter
1726𓀴and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
1727𓀴went on:--
1728𓀴
1729𓀴“The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
1730𓀴yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
1731𓀴unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held
1732𓀴out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
1733𓀴envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
1734𓀴he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
1735𓀴I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
1736𓀴
1737𓀴When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
1738𓀴coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
1739𓀴courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
1740𓀴sleeping, he said:--
1741𓀴
1742𓀴“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
1743𓀴may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
1744𓀴to me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed,
1745𓀴and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.
1746𓀴

1748𓀴
1749𓀴_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
1750𓀴with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
1751𓀴that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
1752𓀴surprise, again a shock!
1753𓀴
1754𓀴Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
1755𓀴relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
1756𓀴might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
1757𓀴awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
1758𓀴portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.
1759𓀴
1760𓀴The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
1761𓀴rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
1762𓀴scheme of villainy....
1763𓀴
1764𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1765𓀴
1766𓀴_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
1767𓀴cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
1768𓀴and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
1769𓀴With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
1770𓀴leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
1771𓀴each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
1772𓀴sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
1773𓀴ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
1774𓀴main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
1775𓀴shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
1776𓀴
1777𓀴Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
1778𓀴stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out,
1779𓀴and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
1780𓀴laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
1781𓀴entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
1782𓀴The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
1783𓀴rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
1784𓀴handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
1785𓀴they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
1786𓀴yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
1787𓀴it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards, I
1788𓀴heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.
1789𓀴
1790𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1791𓀴
1792𓀴_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and
1793𓀴locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
1794𓀴winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
1795𓀴thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
1796𓀴The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
1797𓀴some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound
1798𓀴as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
1799𓀴ruthless villainy.
1800𓀴
1801𓀴I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
1802𓀴something coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched
1803𓀴carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
1804𓀴find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
1805𓀴travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
1806𓀴had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
1807𓀴and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
1808𓀴allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
1809𓀴evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
1810𓀴letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
1811𓀴people be attributed to me.
1812𓀴
1813𓀴It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
1814𓀴here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
1815𓀴is even a criminal’s right and consolation.
1816𓀴
1817𓀴I thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat
1818𓀴doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
1819𓀴quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
1820𓀴like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
1821𓀴clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
1822𓀴soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
1823𓀴embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
1824𓀴fully the aërial gambolling.
1825𓀴
1826𓀴Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
1827𓀴below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
1828𓀴ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
1829𓀴the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
1830𓀴awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
1831𓀴and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
1832𓀴was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
1833𓀴moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
1834𓀴beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
1835𓀴shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
1836𓀴senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
1837𓀴becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
1838𓀴three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
1839𓀴safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
1840𓀴was burning brightly.
1841𓀴
1842𓀴When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
1843𓀴Count’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
1844𓀴there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
1845𓀴beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
1846𓀴could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.
1847𓀴
1848𓀴As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
1849𓀴woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
1850𓀴the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
1851𓀴hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
1852𓀴against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
1853𓀴threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--
1854𓀴
1855𓀴“Monster, give me my child!”
1856𓀴
1857𓀴She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
1858𓀴words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
1859𓀴breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
1860𓀴emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
1861𓀴her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
1862𓀴
1863𓀴Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
1864𓀴Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
1865𓀴answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
1866𓀴had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,
1867𓀴through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
1868𓀴
1869𓀴There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
1870𓀴short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
1871𓀴
1872𓀴I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
1873𓀴she was better dead.
1874𓀴
1875𓀴What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
1876𓀴thing of night and gloom and fear?
1877𓀴
1878𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1879𓀴
1880𓀴_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night
1881𓀴how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
1882𓀴sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
1883𓀴gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
1884𓀴as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
1885𓀴if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
1886𓀴take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
1887𓀴night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
1888𓀴series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
1889𓀴earth.
1890𓀴
1891𓀴Let me not think of it. Action!
1892𓀴
1893𓀴It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
1894𓀴threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
1895𓀴Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
1896𓀴he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
1897𓀴But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.
1898𓀴
1899𓀴Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
1900𓀴why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
1901𓀴window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
1902𓀴chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
1903𓀴it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a
1904𓀴calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
1905𓀴in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
1906𓀴second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!
1907𓀴
1908𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1909𓀴
1910𓀴_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
1911𓀴come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
1912𓀴went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
1913𓀴side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
1914𓀴around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
1915𓀴and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
1916𓀴took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
1917𓀴once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
1918𓀴not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
1919𓀴well the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it
1920𓀴as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
1921𓀴not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed
1922𓀴ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
1923𓀴trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
1924𓀴I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
1925𓀴around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
1926𓀴The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
1927𓀴seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
1928𓀴style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
1929𓀴for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
1930𓀴anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
1931𓀴corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
1932𓀴Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
1933𓀴though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
1934𓀴less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
1935𓀴some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
1936𓀴
1937𓀴At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
1938𓀴could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
1939𓀴was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
1940𓀴all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
1941𓀴passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
1942𓀴minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
1943𓀴by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
1944𓀴tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
1945𓀴odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
1946𓀴grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
1947𓀴ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
1948𓀴been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
1949𓀴steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
1950𓀴the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
1951𓀴brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
1952𓀴any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
1953𓀴the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
1954𓀴vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
1955𓀴my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
1956𓀴of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
1957𓀴discovery.
1958𓀴
1959𓀴There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
1960𓀴pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
1961𓀴could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
1962𓀴glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
1963𓀴their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
1964𓀴movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
1965𓀴and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
1966𓀴there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
1967𓀴By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
1968𓀴I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
1969𓀴the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
1970𓀴though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
1971𓀴leaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle
1972𓀴wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
1973𓀴to think....
1974𓀴
1975𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
1976𓀴
1977𓀴_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
1978𓀴taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
1979𓀴castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
1980𓀴lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
1981𓀴destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would
1982𓀴have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
1983𓀴to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
1984𓀴till I fell asleep.
1985𓀴
1986𓀴I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
1987𓀴look as he said:--
1988𓀴
1989𓀴“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
1990𓀴England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
1991𓀴meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
1992𓀴here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
1993𓀴Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
1994𓀴Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
1995𓀴bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
1996𓀴Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
1997𓀴Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
1998𓀴Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
1999𓀴connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--
2000𓀴
2001𓀴“Why may I not go to-night?”
2002𓀴
2003𓀴“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”
2004𓀴
2005𓀴“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled,
2006𓀴such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
2007𓀴behind his smoothness. He said:--
2008𓀴
2009𓀴“And your baggage?”
2010𓀴
2011𓀴“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”
2012𓀴
2013𓀴The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
2014𓀴eyes, it seemed so real:--
2015𓀴
2016𓀴“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
2017𓀴that which rules our _boyars_: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting
2018𓀴guest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
2019𓀴in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
2020𓀴you so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the
2021𓀴lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
2022𓀴stopped.
2023𓀴
2024𓀴“Hark!”
2025𓀴
2026𓀴Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
2027𓀴sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
2028𓀴orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause
2029𓀴of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
2030𓀴the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
2031𓀴open.
2032𓀴
2033𓀴To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
2034𓀴looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.
2035𓀴
2036𓀴As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
2037𓀴and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
2038𓀴feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
2039𓀴to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
2040𓀴allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
2041𓀴continued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.
2042𓀴Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
2043𓀴doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
2044𓀴was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
2045𓀴as a last chance I cried out:--
2046𓀴
2047𓀴“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my
2048𓀴hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
2049𓀴powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
2050𓀴and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.
2051𓀴
2052𓀴In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
2053𓀴to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
2054𓀴to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
2055𓀴Judas in hell might be proud of.
2056𓀴
2057𓀴When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
2058𓀴whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
2059𓀴deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--
2060𓀴
2061𓀴“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
2062𓀴patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,
2063𓀴sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
2064𓀴without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
2065𓀴all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.
2066𓀴
2067𓀴I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
2068𓀴the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
2069𓀴dear!
2070𓀴
2071𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
2072𓀴
2073𓀴_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this
2074𓀴diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
2075𓀴on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
2076𓀴ready.
2077𓀴
2078𓀴At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
2079𓀴had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
2080𓀴With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
2081𓀴that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
2082𓀴that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
2083𓀴massive bolts.
2084𓀴
2085𓀴But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
2086𓀴the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
2087𓀴casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
2088𓀴Count.
2089𓀴
2090𓀴Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
2091𓀴determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s
2092𓀴room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
2093𓀴evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
2094𓀴down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that
2095𓀴was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
2096𓀴remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
2097𓀴stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
2098𓀴enough where to find the monster I sought.
2099𓀴
2100𓀴The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
2101𓀴was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
2102𓀴places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
2103𓀴I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
2104𓀴something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
2105𓀴but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
2106𓀴and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
2107𓀴and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
2108𓀴ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
2109𓀴corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
2110𓀴burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
2111𓀴underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
2112𓀴simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
2113𓀴repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
2114𓀴me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
2115𓀴coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
2116𓀴horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
2117𓀴key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
2118𓀴on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
2119𓀴was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
2120𓀴he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
2121𓀴create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
2122𓀴helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
2123𓀴to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
2124𓀴but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
2125𓀴cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
2126𓀴hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
2127𓀴upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
2128𓀴paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
2129𓀴merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
2130𓀴hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
2131𓀴caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
2132𓀴thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
2133𓀴blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
2134𓀴own in the nethermost hell.
2135𓀴
2136𓀴I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
2137𓀴on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
2138𓀴waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
2139𓀴closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
2140𓀴cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
2141𓀴spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
2142𓀴contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s
2143𓀴room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
2144𓀴With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
2145𓀴key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
2146𓀴have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
2147𓀴the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
2148𓀴dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
2149𓀴run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
2150𓀴but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
2151𓀴door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
2152𓀴the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
2153𓀴hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
2154𓀴round me more closely.
2155𓀴
2156𓀴As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
2157𓀴and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
2158𓀴with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
2159𓀴box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
2160𓀴along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
2161𓀴
2162𓀴The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
2163𓀴in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
2164𓀴shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
2165𓀴
2166𓀴Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
2167𓀴the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
2168𓀴distance.
2169𓀴
2170𓀴I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
2171𓀴and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!
2172𓀴
2173𓀴I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
2174𓀴farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
2175𓀴me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.
2176𓀴
2177𓀴And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
2178𓀴from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
2179𓀴children still walk with earthly feet!
2180𓀴
2181𓀴At least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
2182𓀴precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.
2183𓀴Good-bye, all! Mina!

2190𓀴_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._
2191𓀴
2192𓀴
2193𓀴“_9 May._
2194𓀴
2195𓀴“My dearest Lucy,--
2196𓀴
2197𓀴“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
2198𓀴with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
2199𓀴I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
2200𓀴freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
2201𓀴lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have
2202𓀴been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
2203𓀴be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
2204𓀴can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for
2205𓀴him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He
2206𓀴and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a
2207𓀴stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I
2208𓀴shall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of those
2209𓀴two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
2210𓀴sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
2211𓀴suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
2212𓀴intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
2213𓀴anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
2214𓀴to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
2215𓀴descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
2216𓀴a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
2217𓀴said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
2218𓀴plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
2219𓀴from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
2220𓀴am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
2221𓀴countries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them
2222𓀴together. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.
2223𓀴
2224𓀴“Your loving
2225𓀴
2226𓀴“MINA.
2227𓀴
2228𓀴“Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
2229𓀴a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
2230𓀴curly-haired man???”
2231𓀴
2232𓀴
2233𓀴_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.
2234𓀴
2235𓀴“_17, Chatham Street_,
2236𓀴
2237𓀴“_Wednesday_.
2238𓀴
2239𓀴“My dearest Mina,--
2240𓀴
2241𓀴“I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
2242𓀴wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
2243𓀴_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
2244𓀴to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
2245𓀴to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
2246𓀴tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
2247𓀴last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
2248𓀴Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
2249𓀴together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
2250𓀴time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
2251𓀴engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
2252𓀴off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
2253𓀴is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
2254𓀴his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
2255𓀴see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
2256𓀴I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
2257𓀴can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
2258𓀴a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
2259𓀴read one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
2260𓀴myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
2261𓀴you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not
2262𓀴a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
2263𓀴have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
2264𓀴study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
2265𓀴interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
2266𓀴bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
2267𓀴There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
2268𓀴since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
2269𓀴laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
2270𓀴to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing
2271𓀴as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in
2272𓀴words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
2273𓀴does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
2274𓀴undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
2275𓀴I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
2276𓀴or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I _do_ so
2277𓀴want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all
2278𓀴that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your
2279𓀴prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.
2280𓀴
2281𓀴“LUCY.
2282𓀴
2283𓀴“P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.
2284𓀴
2285𓀴“L.”
2286𓀴
2287𓀴_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.
2288𓀴
2289𓀴“_24 May_.
2290𓀴
2291𓀴“My dearest Mina,--
2292𓀴
2293𓀴“Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
2294𓀴nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
2295𓀴
2296𓀴“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
2297𓀴Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
2298𓀴proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
2299𓀴Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,
2300𓀴really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
2301𓀴happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
2302𓀴But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be
2303𓀴getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
2304𓀴and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
2305𓀴least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
2306𓀴are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
2307𓀴despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
2308𓀴it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You
2309𓀴will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
2310𓀴Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think
2311𓀴so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
2312𓀴be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
2313𓀴quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
2314𓀴before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum
2315𓀴man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
2316𓀴outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
2317𓀴himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
2318𓀴almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do
2319𓀴when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
2320𓀴playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
2321𓀴me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
2322𓀴though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
2323𓀴help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
2324𓀴did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
2325𓀴and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
2326𓀴I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
2327𓀴and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
2328𓀴else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
2329𓀴confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was
2330𓀴free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
2331𓀴tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
2332𓀴stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
2333𓀴hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
2334𓀴wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t
2335𓀴help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
2336𓀴proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at
2337𓀴all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
2338𓀴loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
2339𓀴know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
2340𓀴quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
2341𓀴miserable, though I am so happy.
2342𓀴
2343𓀴“_Evening._
2344𓀴
2345𓀴“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
2346𓀴off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
2347𓀴came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
2348𓀴he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
2349𓀴has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
2350𓀴with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
2351𓀴ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
2352𓀴we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
2353𓀴what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
2354𓀴don’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
2355𓀴told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
2356𓀴Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
2357𓀴alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I
2358𓀴helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
2359𓀴beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,
2360𓀴he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
2361𓀴educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me
2362𓀴to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
2363𓀴was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
2364𓀴dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
2365𓀴has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
2366𓀴ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
2367𓀴heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
2368𓀴as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
2369𓀴very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--
2370𓀴
2371𓀴“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your
2372𓀴little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
2373𓀴will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t
2374𓀴you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
2375𓀴together, driving in double harness?’
2376𓀴
2377𓀴“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem
2378𓀴half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
2379𓀴lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
2380𓀴wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
2381𓀴a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
2382𓀴on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
2383𓀴really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help
2384𓀴feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
2385𓀴flirt--though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
2386𓀴number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
2387𓀴began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
2388𓀴heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
2389𓀴never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
2390𓀴because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
2391𓀴which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
2392𓀴manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--
2393𓀴
2394𓀴“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
2395𓀴speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
2396𓀴through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
2397𓀴to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
2398𓀴I’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
2399𓀴let me, a very faithful friend.’
2400𓀴
2401𓀴“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
2402𓀴of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
2403𓀴gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think
2404𓀴this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very
2405𓀴badly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
2406𓀴her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
2407𓀴it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
2408𓀴Mr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--
2409𓀴
2410𓀴“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
2411𓀴even loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
2412𓀴light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I
2413𓀴think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--
2414𓀴
2415𓀴“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of
2416𓀴winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t
2417𓀴cry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it
2418𓀴standing up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d
2419𓀴better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,
2420𓀴your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than a
2421𓀴lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty
2422𓀴lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss?
2423𓀴It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
2424𓀴know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,
2425𓀴my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spoken
2426𓀴yet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
2427𓀴noble, too, to a rival--wasn’t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and
2428𓀴kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
2429𓀴into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--
2430𓀴
2431𓀴“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
2432𓀴things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
2433𓀴honesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
2434𓀴went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
2435𓀴quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
2436𓀴that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
2437𓀴worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only
2438𓀴I don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
2439𓀴cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
2440𓀴don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
2441𓀴
2442𓀴“Ever your loving
2443𓀴
2444𓀴“LUCY.
2445𓀴
2446𓀴“P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn’t tell you of number Three, need
2447𓀴I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
2448𓀴coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
2449𓀴kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to
2450𓀴deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
2451𓀴ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
2452𓀴lover, such a husband, and such a friend.
2453𓀴
2454𓀴“Good-bye.”

2460𓀴
2461𓀴_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
2462𓀴diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
2463𓀴feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
2464𓀴the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
2465𓀴work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
2466𓀴afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
2467𓀴determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get
2468𓀴nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.
2469𓀴
2470𓀴I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
2471𓀴myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
2472𓀴it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
2473𓀴him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients
2474𓀴as I would the mouth of hell.
2475𓀴
2476𓀴(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
2477𓀴_Omnia Romæ venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be
2478𓀴anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
2479𓀴_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--
2480𓀴
2481𓀴R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
2482𓀴morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
2483𓀴cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
2484𓀴disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
2485𓀴dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
2486𓀴is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
2487𓀴on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
2488𓀴balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
2489𓀴point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of
2490𓀴accidents can balance it.

2533𓀴MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL
2534𓀴
2535𓀴
2536𓀴_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
2537𓀴lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
2538𓀴which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
2539𓀴Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
2540𓀴harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
2541𓀴view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
2542𓀴beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
2543𓀴on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
2544𓀴see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
2545𓀴red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
2546𓀴pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
2547𓀴Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
2548𓀴“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
2549𓀴ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
2550𓀴a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
2551𓀴the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
2552𓀴graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
2553𓀴Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
2554𓀴harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
2555𓀴stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
2556𓀴part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
2557𓀴destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
2558𓀴out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
2559𓀴them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
2560𓀴looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
2561𓀴sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
2562𓀴book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
2563𓀴sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
2564𓀴talk.
2565𓀴
2566𓀴The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
2567𓀴stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
2568𓀴the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
2569𓀴of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
2570𓀴and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
2571𓀴narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
2572𓀴
2573𓀴It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
2574𓀴nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
2575𓀴banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
2576𓀴side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
2577𓀴which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
2578𓀴it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
2579𓀴mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
2580𓀴lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
2581𓀴is coming this way....
2582𓀴
2583𓀴He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
2584𓀴gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
2585𓀴nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
2586𓀴fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
2587𓀴person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
2588𓀴at the abbey he said very brusquely:--
2589𓀴
2590𓀴“I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
2591𓀴Mind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t in
2592𓀴my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,
2593𓀴but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
2594𓀴Leeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’
2595𓀴out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be
2596𓀴bothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
2597𓀴fool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
2598𓀴things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
2599𓀴the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
2600𓀴when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--
2601𓀴
2602𓀴“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like
2603𓀴to be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
2604𓀴crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lack
2605𓀴belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
2606𓀴
2607𓀴He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
2608𓀴the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
2609𓀴the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how
2610𓀴many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
2611𓀴a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
2612𓀴have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
2613𓀴out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
2614𓀴not go. They will be home by this.
2615𓀴
2616𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
2617𓀴
2618𓀴_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
2619𓀴interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
2620𓀴and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
2621𓀴must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
2622𓀴anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies
2623𓀴them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
2624𓀴was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
2625𓀴beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
2626𓀴not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
2627𓀴She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
2628𓀴on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
2629𓀴gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
2630𓀴and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
2631𓀴and put it down:--
2632𓀴
2633𓀴“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’
2634𓀴nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles
2635𓀴an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women
2636𓀴a-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs
2637𓀴an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’
2638𓀴railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do
2639𓀴somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
2640𓀴o’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper
2641𓀴an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the
2642𓀴tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
2643𓀴steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
2644𓀴is acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
2645𓀴them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of
2646𓀴them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’
2647𓀴the memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
2648𓀴sacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My
2649𓀴gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
2650𓀴come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to
2651𓀴drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
2652𓀴trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from
2653𓀴lyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”
2654𓀴
2655𓀴I could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in
2656𓀴which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
2657𓀴“showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:--
2658𓀴
2659𓀴“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
2660𓀴all wrong?”
2661𓀴
2662𓀴“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make
2663𓀴out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
2664𓀴like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
2665𓀴look you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” I
2666𓀴nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
2667𓀴understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
2668𓀴He went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
2669𓀴happed here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where
2670𓀴the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
2671𓀴old Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions,
2672𓀴and they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
2673𓀴that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over and
2674𓀴read:--
2675𓀴
2676𓀴“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
2677𓀴Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--
2678𓀴
2679𓀴“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
2680𓀴of Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
2681𓀴dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”--he pointed
2682𓀴northwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
2683𓀴steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
2684𓀴the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in
2685𓀴the _Lively_ off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
2686𓀴same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
2687𓀴later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
2688𓀴in the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have
2689𓀴to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
2690𓀴aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’
2691𓀴jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice
2692𓀴in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’
2693𓀴tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was
2694𓀴evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
2695𓀴cronies joined in with gusto.
2696𓀴
2697𓀴“But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
2698𓀴assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
2699𓀴take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
2700𓀴that will be really necessary?”
2701𓀴
2702𓀴“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”
2703𓀴
2704𓀴“To please their relatives, I suppose.”
2705𓀴
2706𓀴“To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intense
2707𓀴scorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
2708𓀴over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He
2709𓀴pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
2710𓀴which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the
2711𓀴lies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me
2712𓀴from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over

2714𓀴
2715𓀴“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
2716𓀴glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
2717𓀴Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
2718𓀴beloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’
2719𓀴Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke
2720𓀴her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
2721𓀴
2722𓀴“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the
2723𓀴sorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
2724𓀴acrewk’d--a regular lamiter he was--an’ he hated her so that he
2725𓀴committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on
2726𓀴his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
2727𓀴they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it
2728𓀴brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the
2729𓀴rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him
2730𓀴say masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious
2731𓀴that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where
2732𓀴she was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his
2733𓀴stick as he spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle
2734𓀴when Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
2735𓀴his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”
2736𓀴
2737𓀴I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
2738𓀴said, rising up:--
2739𓀴
2740𓀴“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
2741𓀴leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
2742𓀴suicide.”
2743𓀴
2744𓀴“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
2745𓀴have so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve
2746𓀴sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me
2747𓀴no harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie
2748𓀴there either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
2749𓀴tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.
2750𓀴There’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off
2751𓀴he hobbled.
2752𓀴
2753𓀴Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
2754𓀴took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
2755𓀴their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
2756𓀴haven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.

2760𓀴_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
2761𓀴letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
2762𓀴The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
2763𓀴town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
2764𓀴they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
2765𓀴left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
2766𓀴the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
2767𓀴me, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.
2768𓀴The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
2769𓀴along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
2770𓀴Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
2771𓀴both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
2772𓀴were here.

2776𓀴
2777𓀴_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
2778𓀴understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
2779𓀴selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
2780𓀴object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
2781𓀴but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
2782𓀴animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
2783𓀴sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
2784𓀴sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
2785𓀴quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
2786𓀴did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
2787𓀴simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have
2788𓀴three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I
2789𓀴must watch him.

2792𓀴
2793𓀴_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
2794𓀴very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
2795𓀴the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
2796𓀴has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
2797𓀴room.

2800𓀴
2801𓀴_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
2802𓀴flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
2803𓀴very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
2804𓀴events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
2805𓀴as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
2806𓀴horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
2807𓀴he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
2808𓀴and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
2809𓀴mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
2810𓀴was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
2811𓀴gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
2812𓀴watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
2813𓀴in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always
2814𓀴jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
2815𓀴figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
2816𓀴totals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some
2817𓀴account, as the auditors put it.

2821𓀴_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
2822𓀴my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
2823𓀴unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
2824𓀴conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
2825𓀴might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
2826𓀴that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
2827𓀴managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
2828𓀴of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
2829𓀴do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
2830𓀴tempting them with his food.

2833𓀴
2834𓀴_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
2835𓀴sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
2836𓀴in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,
2837𓀴very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
2838𓀴him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
2839𓀴bearing:--
2840𓀴
2841𓀴“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
2842𓀴and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” I was not unprepared for this
2843𓀴request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
2844𓀴vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
2845𓀴should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
2846𓀴I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
2847𓀴cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--
2848𓀴
2849𓀴“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
2850𓀴refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook
2851𓀴my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
2852𓀴that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
2853𓀴danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
2854𓀴killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
2855𓀴with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
2856𓀴more.

2859𓀴
2860𓀴_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
2861𓀴brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
2862𓀴implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
2863𓀴I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
2864𓀴he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
2865𓀴where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.

2869𓀴_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
2870𓀴rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
2871𓀴which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
2872𓀴fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
2873𓀴looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
2874𓀴were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
2875𓀴There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
2876𓀴blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
2877𓀴there were anything odd about him during the day.

2880𓀴
2881𓀴_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
2882𓀴been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is,
2883𓀴doctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
2884𓀴and ate them raw!”

2887𓀴
2888𓀴_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make
2889𓀴even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
2890𓀴that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
2891𓀴proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
2892𓀴invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous
2893𓀴(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
2894𓀴can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
2895𓀴gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
2896𓀴wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
2897𓀴steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
2898𓀴might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
2899𓀴vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science
2900𓀴in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had
2901𓀴I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of
2902𓀴even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
2903𓀴compared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s
2904𓀴brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
2905𓀴cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
2906𓀴cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
2907𓀴exceptional brain, congenitally?
2908𓀴
2909𓀴How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
2910𓀴wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
2911𓀴closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
2912𓀴many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?
2913𓀴
2914𓀴To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
2915𓀴and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
2916𓀴Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
2917𓀴profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
2918𓀴angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
2919𓀴hopeless and work. Work! work!
2920𓀴
2921𓀴If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a
2922𓀴good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.

2925𓀴_Mina Murray’s Journal._
2926𓀴
2927𓀴_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
2928𓀴is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. And
2929𓀴there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
2930𓀴different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
2931𓀴had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
2932𓀴yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
2933𓀴him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
2934𓀴had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
2935𓀴and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
2936𓀴I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
2937𓀴although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
2938𓀴her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
2939𓀴that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
2940𓀴got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
2941𓀴along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
2942𓀴with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
2943𓀴naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’s
2944𓀴father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
2945𓀴himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
2946𓀴autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
2947𓀴to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
2948𓀴and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
2949𓀴make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
2950𓀴son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can
2951𓀴leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
2952𓀴counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
2953𓀴on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
2954𓀴is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
2955𓀴arrives.

2959𓀴_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
2960𓀴though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
2961𓀴it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
2962𓀴am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
2963𓀴hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
2964𓀴being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
2965𓀴wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
2966𓀴suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
2967𓀴ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
2968𓀴her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
2969𓀴rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will
2970𓀴all last.

2974𓀴_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
2975𓀴Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
2976𓀴surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
2977𓀴somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
2978𓀴his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
2979𓀴her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
2980𓀴which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
2981𓀴me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
2982𓀴searching for the key.
2983𓀴
2984𓀴_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
2985𓀴dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
2986𓀴feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
2987𓀴letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
2988𓀴than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
2989𓀴the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
2990𓀴learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
2991𓀴hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except
2992𓀴the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
2993𓀴grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
2994𓀴grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
2995𓀴is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
2996𓀴muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
2997𓀴mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
2998𓀴there is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
2999𓀴Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
3000𓀴the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are
3001𓀴racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
3002𓀴the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
3003𓀴making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
3004𓀴he wants to talk....
3005𓀴
3006𓀴I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
3007𓀴down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--
3008𓀴
3009𓀴“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,
3010𓀴so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
3011𓀴fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--
3012𓀴
3013𓀴“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
3014𓀴things I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
3015𓀴but I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. We
3016𓀴aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t
3017𓀴altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;
3018𓀴an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up my
3019𓀴own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a
3020𓀴bit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
3021𓀴hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
3022𓀴expect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ his
3023𓀴scythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at
3024𓀴once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
3025𓀴Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my
3026𓀴deary!”--for he saw that I was crying--“if he should come this very
3027𓀴night I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
3028𓀴waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that
3029𓀴we can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my
3030𓀴deary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and
3031𓀴wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ with
3032𓀴it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he
3033𓀴cried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
3034𓀴that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the
3035𓀴air; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
3036𓀴comes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
3037𓀴moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he got
3038𓀴up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
3039𓀴off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.
3040𓀴
3041𓀴I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
3042𓀴arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
3043𓀴kept looking at a strange ship.
3044𓀴
3045𓀴“I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;
3046𓀴but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her mind
3047𓀴a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to
3048𓀴run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
3049𓀴steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;
3050𓀴changes about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before
3051𓀴this time to-morrow.”

3061𓀴(_Pasted in Mina Murray’s Journal._)
3062𓀴
3063𓀴From a Correspondent.
3064𓀴
3065𓀴_Whitby_.
3066𓀴
3067𓀴One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
3068𓀴experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
3069𓀴been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
3070𓀴August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
3071𓀴body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
3072𓀴Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
3073𓀴the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
3074𓀴trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
3075𓀴“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
3076𓀴afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
3077𓀴churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
3078𓀴sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
3079𓀴“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
3080𓀴blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
3081𓀴language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once
3082𓀴made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
3083𓀴kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
3084𓀴manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
3085𓀴beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
3086𓀴there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
3087𓀴churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
3088𓀴mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
3089𓀴downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
3090𓀴purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
3091𓀴there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
3092𓀴sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
3093𓀴experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
3094𓀴sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.
3095𓀴I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
3096𓀴there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different
3097𓀴classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
3098𓀴The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
3099𓀴was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
3100𓀴the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
3101𓀴were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
3102𓀴which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
3103𓀴few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
3104𓀴schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
3105𓀴foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
3106𓀴comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
3107𓀴her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
3108𓀴was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
3109𓀴swell of the sea,
3110𓀴
3111𓀴    “As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”
3112𓀴
3113𓀴Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
3114𓀴oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
3115𓀴inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
3116𓀴band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
3117𓀴great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a
3118𓀴strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
3119𓀴carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.
3120𓀴
3121𓀴Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
3122𓀴time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
3123𓀴the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
3124𓀴growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
3125𓀴the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
3126𓀴White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
3127𓀴shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
3128𓀴the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
3129𓀴of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
3130𓀴force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
3131𓀴or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
3132𓀴to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
3133𓀴fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
3134𓀴the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
3135𓀴drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
3136𓀴so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
3137𓀴imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
3138𓀴touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
3139𓀴a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
3140𓀴cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
3141𓀴lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
3142𓀴of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
3143𓀴of the footsteps of the storm.
3144𓀴
3145𓀴Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
3146𓀴absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
3147𓀴each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
3148𓀴snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with
3149𓀴a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
3150𓀴the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East
3151𓀴Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
3152𓀴tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
3153𓀴the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
3154𓀴Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,
3155𓀴with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
3156𓀴of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
3157𓀴piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
3158𓀴joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
3159𓀴to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
3160𓀴
3161𓀴Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
3162𓀴with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
3163𓀴earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
3164𓀴and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
3165𓀴realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
3166𓀴port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
3167𓀴to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
3168𓀴it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
3169𓀴harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
3170𓀴great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
3171𓀴visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
3172𓀴speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
3173𓀴if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
3174𓀴any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
3175𓀴like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
3176𓀴for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
3177𓀴booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
3178𓀴than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
3179𓀴mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
3180𓀴breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
3181𓀴of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
3182𓀴the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
3183𓀴swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
3184𓀴gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
3185𓀴shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
3186𓀴corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
3187𓀴motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
3188𓀴awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
3189𓀴found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
3190𓀴all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
3191𓀴schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
3192𓀴that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
3193𓀴storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
3194𓀴Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
3195𓀴
3196𓀴There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
3197𓀴the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
3198𓀴“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
3199𓀴the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
3200𓀴if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
3201𓀴on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
3202𓀴hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
3203𓀴tombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in
3204𓀴the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
3205𓀴has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
3206𓀴intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
3207𓀴
3208𓀴It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
3209𓀴all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
3210𓀴out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
3211𓀴side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
3212𓀴first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
3213𓀴the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
3214𓀴light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
3215𓀴when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
3216𓀴once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
3217𓀴curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
3218𓀴round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
3219𓀴correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
3220𓀴When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
3221𓀴whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
3222𓀴courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
3223𓀴to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
3224𓀴whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
3225𓀴
3226𓀴It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
3227𓀴not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
3228𓀴by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
3229𓀴the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
3230𓀴was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
3231𓀴the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
3232𓀴the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
3233𓀴the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
3234𓀴was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
3235𓀴state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
3236𓀴Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
3237𓀴examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
3238𓀴pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
3239𓀴paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
3240𓀴the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
3241𓀴teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
3242𓀴complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
3243𓀴claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
3244𓀴derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
3245𓀴law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
3246𓀴completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
3247𓀴statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
3248𓀴delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say
3249𓀴that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
3250𓀴he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
3251𓀴noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
3252𓀴await inquest.
3253𓀴
3254𓀴Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
3255𓀴crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
3256𓀴the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
3257𓀴details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
3258𓀴harbour in the storm.
3259𓀴
3260𓀴_Whitby_
3261𓀴
3262𓀴_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
3263𓀴storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
3264𓀴turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
3265𓀴_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
3266𓀴small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
3267𓀴This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
3268𓀴7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
3269𓀴possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
3270𓀴acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
3271𓀴paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
3272𓀴the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
3273𓀴most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
3274𓀴existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they
3275𓀴are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
3276𓀴complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
3277𓀴landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
3278𓀴S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
3279𓀴animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
3280𓀴it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
3281𓀴was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
3282𓀴hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
3283𓀴possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
3284𓀴is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred
3285𓀴mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
3286𓀴dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,
3287𓀴and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
3288𓀴and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.

3291𓀴
3292𓀴_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
3293𓀴permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order
3294𓀴up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
3295𓀴except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
3296𓀴with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
3297𓀴at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
3298𓀴unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
3299𓀴concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
3300𓀴rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
3301𓀴supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
3302𓀴some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
3303𓀴this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
3304𓀴statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the
3305𓀴dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
3306𓀴me, time being short.

3356𓀴
3357𓀴On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
3358𓀴an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
3359𓀴aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
3360𓀴behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
3361𓀴thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
3362𓀴and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
3363𓀴but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
3364𓀴He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
3365𓀴spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
3366𓀴stem to stern.

3370𓀴Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
3371𓀴evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
3372𓀴stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
3373𓀴foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
3374𓀴them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
3375𓀴rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
3376𓀴no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
3377𓀴were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
3378𓀴search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
3379𓀴said nothing.

3385𓀴Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad

3391𓀴and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
3392𓀴night another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
3393𓀴watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
3394𓀴robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
3395𓀴angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
3396𓀴some violence.

3402𓀴know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
3403𓀴volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours’ sleep.
3404𓀴Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is

3411𓀴except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
3412𓀴but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
3413𓀴and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.

3419𓀴me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
3420𓀴two hands left to work ship.

3426𓀴Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
3427𓀴as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
3428𓀴doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
3429𓀴seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
3430𓀴working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
3431𓀴Russian, he Roumanian.

3436𓀴seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
3437𓀴ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
3438𓀴watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
3439𓀴of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
3440𓀴he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
3441𓀴only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
3442𓀴seems to have deserted us.

3446𓀴_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
3447𓀴when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
3448𓀴before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
3449𓀴mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
3450𓀴looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
3451𓀴way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
3452𓀴ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_It_ is here; I know
3453𓀴it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
3454𓀴and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
3455𓀴It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
3456𓀴air.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
3457𓀴space. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the
3458𓀴hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and
3459𓀴see. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his
3460𓀴lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
3461𓀴not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest
3462𓀴and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
3463𓀴raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those
3464𓀴big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as
3465𓀴harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
3466𓀴write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
3467𓀴Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
3468𓀴down sails and lie by, and signal for help....

3471𓀴
3472𓀴It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
3473𓀴would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the
3474𓀴hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,
3475𓀴startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
3476𓀴came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
3477𓀴his face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then
3478𓀴looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
3479𓀴a steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is
3480𓀴too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
3481𓀴from Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, or
3482𓀴move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
3483𓀴threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
3484𓀴this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
3485𓀴followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
3486𓀴horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?

3489𓀴
3490𓀴_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
3491𓀴sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
3492𓀴below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
3493𓀴the dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
3494𓀴right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
3495𓀴sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
3496𓀴leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
3497𓀴my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
3498𓀴them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good
3499𓀴wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
3500𓀴growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
3501𓀴face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
3502𓀴this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
3503𓀴... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God
3504𓀴and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
3505𓀴to do his duty....

3508𓀴
3509𓀴Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
3510𓀴and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
3511𓀴none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
3512𓀴simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
3513𓀴arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
3514𓀴for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
3515𓀴steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
3516𓀴of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
3517𓀴wishing to follow him to the grave.
3518𓀴
3519𓀴No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
3520𓀴mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
3521𓀴believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
3522𓀴will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”

3526𓀴
3527𓀴_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
3528𓀴sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
3529𓀴chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
3530𓀴like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
3531𓀴twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
3532𓀴managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
3533𓀴is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
3534𓀴thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
3535𓀴disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
3536𓀴life.
3537𓀴
3538𓀴Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
3539𓀴if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
3540𓀴and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
3541𓀴grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
3542𓀴topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
3543𓀴of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
3544𓀴felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
3545𓀴oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
3546𓀴anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!

3549𓀴
3550𓀴_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
3551𓀴touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
3552𓀴was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
3553𓀴churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
3554𓀴the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
3555𓀴again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
3556𓀴The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
3557𓀴it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
3558𓀴She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
3559𓀴her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
3560𓀴she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
3561𓀴there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
3562𓀴cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
3563𓀴seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
3564𓀴fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
3565𓀴fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
3566𓀴dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
3567𓀴sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
3568𓀴people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
3569𓀴not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
3570𓀴who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
3571𓀴The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
3572𓀴the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
3573𓀴not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
3574𓀴yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
3575𓀴harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
3576𓀴noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
3577𓀴bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally
3578𓀴the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
3579𓀴took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
3580𓀴the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
3581𓀴stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
3582𓀴not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
3583𓀴in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
3584𓀴to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
3585𓀴touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
3586𓀴fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world
3587𓀴without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The
3588𓀴whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead
3589𓀴man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
3590𓀴touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
3591𓀴afford material for her dreams.
3592𓀴
3593𓀴I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
3594𓀴shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and
3595𓀴back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.

3604𓀴
3605𓀴_Same day, 11 o’clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
3606𓀴had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
3607𓀴walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
3608𓀴dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
3609𓀴and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
3610𓀴except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
3611𓀴and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s
3612𓀴Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over
3613𓀴the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
3614𓀴shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
3615𓀴them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
3616𓀴and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
3617𓀴really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
3618𓀴The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
3619𓀴for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
3620𓀴know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
3621𓀴some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
3622𓀴class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be
3623𓀴pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
3624𓀴breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
3625𓀴looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
3626𓀴only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
3627𓀴Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and
3628𓀴women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
3629𓀴accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to
3630𓀴accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
3631𓀴of it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,
3632𓀴because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
3633𓀴corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
3634𓀴quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.

3638𓀴_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
3639𓀴I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
3640𓀴agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
3641𓀴Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
3642𓀴upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
3643𓀴so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
3644𓀴was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
3645𓀴door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
3646𓀴mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
3647𓀴clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
3648𓀴struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
3649𓀴dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
3650𓀴Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said
3651𓀴to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran
3652𓀴downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
3653𓀴all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
3654𓀴chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
3655𓀴was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
3656𓀴of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
3657𓀴Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
3658𓀴might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
3659𓀴big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
3660𓀴Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
3661𓀴Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
3662𓀴the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
3663𓀴the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucy
3664𓀴in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
3665𓀴driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
3666𓀴light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
3667𓀴nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all
3668𓀴around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
3669𓀴coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
3670𓀴a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
3671𓀴visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
3672𓀴there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
3673𓀴half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
3674𓀴quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
3675𓀴immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
3676𓀴the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
3677𓀴whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
3678𓀴glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
3679𓀴fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
3680𓀴Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
3681𓀴that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The
3682𓀴time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
3683𓀴came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
3684𓀴gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
3685𓀴lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
3686𓀴to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
3687𓀴close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
3688𓀴was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
3689𓀴half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and
3690𓀴something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
3691𓀴and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
3692𓀴entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
3693𓀴the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
3694𓀴view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
3695𓀴that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
3696𓀴of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
3697𓀴thing about.
3698𓀴
3699𓀴When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
3700𓀴were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
3701𓀴long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
3702𓀴breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
3703𓀴collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
3704𓀴there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
3705𓀴flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
3706𓀴for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
3707𓀴unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
3708𓀴have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
3709𓀴throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
3710𓀴and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
3711𓀴became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
3712𓀴had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
3713𓀴very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
3714𓀴became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
3715𓀴occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
3716𓀴reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
3717𓀴till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
3718𓀴to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
3719𓀴Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
3720𓀴have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
3721𓀴unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
3722𓀴trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
3723𓀴me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
3724𓀴passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
3725𓀴stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
3726𓀴However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
3727𓀴was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
3728𓀴mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
3729𓀴one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
3730𓀴
3731𓀴Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
3732𓀴a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
3733𓀴us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
3734𓀴there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in
3735𓀴Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
3736𓀴should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
3737𓀴health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
3738𓀴in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
3739𓀴feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
3740𓀴bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
3741𓀴word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I
3742𓀴hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
3743𓀴mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
3744𓀴and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,
3745𓀴infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
3746𓀴so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
3747𓀴my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
3748𓀴soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....

3751𓀴
3752𓀴_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
3753𓀴not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
3754𓀴seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
3755𓀴looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
3756𓀴notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
3757𓀴have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
3758𓀴pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
3759𓀴two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
3760𓀴was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
3761𓀴laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
3762𓀴cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.

3765𓀴
3766𓀴_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
3767𓀴sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
3768𓀴Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
3769𓀴cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
3770𓀴I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
3771𓀴Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
3772𓀴we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
3773𓀴and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
3774𓀴has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
3775𓀴and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
3776𓀴trouble to-night.

3779𓀴
3780𓀴_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
3781𓀴was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
3782𓀴be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
3783𓀴under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
3784𓀴chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
3785𓀴was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
3786𓀴manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
3787𓀴and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
3788𓀴Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
3789𓀴somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make
3790𓀴them more bearable.

3794𓀴_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
3795𓀴before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
3796𓀴still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
3797𓀴aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
3798𓀴effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,
3799𓀴silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
3800𓀴flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
3801𓀴twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
3802𓀴and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
3803𓀴from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
3804𓀴She did not stir again all night.
3805𓀴

3807𓀴
3808𓀴_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
3809𓀴to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
3810𓀴get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
3811𓀴dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
3812𓀴dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
3813𓀴stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
3814𓀴down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
3815𓀴thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
3816𓀴everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
3817𓀴suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--
3818𓀴
3819𓀴“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd
3820𓀴expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
3821𓀴slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
3822𓀴at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
3823𓀴her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
3824𓀴followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
3825𓀴whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
3826𓀴for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
3827𓀴burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
3828𓀴sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our
3829𓀴seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
3830𓀴refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
3831𓀴called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
3832𓀴with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
3833𓀴was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
3834𓀴said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
3835𓀴early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
3836𓀴I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
3837𓀴sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then
3838𓀴bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
3839𓀴Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance
3840𓀴up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that
3841𓀴perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
3842𓀴waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
3843𓀴the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
3844𓀴on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
3845𓀴the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
3846𓀴by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
3847𓀴good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
3848𓀴but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
3849𓀴asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
3850𓀴as though to protect it from cold.
3851𓀴
3852𓀴I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
3853𓀴door is locked and the window securely fastened.
3854𓀴
3855𓀴She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
3856𓀴there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
3857𓀴fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
3858𓀴is.

3861𓀴
3862𓀴_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
3863𓀴slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
3864𓀴Arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
3865𓀴is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
3866𓀴in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
3867𓀴very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
3868𓀴protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
3869𓀴her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
3870𓀴her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
3871𓀴her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
3872𓀴almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
3873𓀴the dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.

3876𓀴
3877𓀴_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
3878𓀴write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
3879𓀴No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
3880𓀴mother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy’s
3881𓀴fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
3882𓀴the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
3883𓀴she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
3884𓀴as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
3885𓀴night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
3886𓀴window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
3887𓀴tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
3888𓀴restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
3889𓀴painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
3890𓀴window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
3891𓀴not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat
3892𓀴just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
3893𓀴They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
3894𓀴edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
3895𓀴red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
3896𓀴doctor seeing about them.

3958𓀴
3959𓀴_18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
3960𓀴churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
3961𓀴night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
3962𓀴to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
3963𓀴were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
3964𓀴gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
3965𓀴seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
3966𓀴needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
3967𓀴very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
3968𓀴the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--
3969𓀴
3970𓀴“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
3971𓀴Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up
3972𓀴Geordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
3973𓀴had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
3974𓀴look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her
3975𓀴habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then she
3976𓀴went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
3977𓀴herself:--
3978𓀴
3979𓀴“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
3980𓀴here in this spot--I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something--I
3981𓀴don’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
3982𓀴through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
3983𓀴I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the
3984𓀴whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
3985𓀴I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
3986𓀴dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
3987𓀴sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
3988𓀴into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
3989𓀴heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
3990𓀴from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
3991𓀴I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
3992𓀴and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
3993𓀴earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
3994𓀴it before I felt you.”
3995𓀴
3996𓀴Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
3997𓀴listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
3998𓀴better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
3999𓀴subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
4000𓀴fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
4001𓀴rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
4002𓀴happy evening together.

4006𓀴_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
4007𓀴Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
4008𓀴am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
4009𓀴me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the
4010𓀴morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
4011𓀴and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
4012𓀴we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister’s
4013𓀴letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of
4014𓀴Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey
4015𓀴is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of
4016𓀴dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for
4017𓀴it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say
4018𓀴to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must
4019𓀴comfort me till we meet.

4026𓀴
4027𓀴“Dear Madam,--
4028𓀴
4029𓀴“I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong
4030𓀴enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph
4031𓀴and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
4032𓀴suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,
4033𓀴and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
4034𓀴Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his
4035𓀴delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few
4036𓀴weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He
4037𓀴wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he
4038𓀴would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
4039𓀴not be wanting for help.
4040𓀴
4041𓀴“Believe me,
4042𓀴
4043𓀴“Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
4044𓀴
4045𓀴“SISTER AGATHA.
4046𓀴
4047𓀴“P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
4048𓀴more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
4049𓀴wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says
4050𓀴our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
4051𓀴wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
4052𓀴what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
4053𓀴of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
4054𓀴his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
4055𓀴knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
4056𓀴could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
4057𓀴was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
4058𓀴shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
4059𓀴he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
4060𓀴way thither that the train reached.
4061𓀴
4062𓀴“Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
4063𓀴sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
4064𓀴doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
4065𓀴safety’s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
4066𓀴many, happy years for you both.”

4069𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
4070𓀴
4071𓀴_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
4072𓀴eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
4073𓀴setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
4074𓀴in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
4075𓀴attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was
4076𓀴quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
4077𓀴would say was:--
4078𓀴
4079𓀴     “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at
4080𓀴     hand.”
4081𓀴
4082𓀴The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
4083𓀴seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
4084𓀴homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
4085𓀴combination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. His
4086𓀴attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
4087𓀴self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
4088𓀴as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
4089𓀴he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
4090𓀴are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
4091𓀴away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
4092𓀴from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
4093𓀴if men only knew!
4094𓀴
4095𓀴For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
4096𓀴greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
4097𓀴observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
4098𓀴eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
4099𓀴the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
4100𓀴know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
4101𓀴bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I
4102𓀴would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
4103𓀴lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
4104𓀴his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--
4105𓀴
4106𓀴“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”
4107𓀴
4108𓀴“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about
4109𓀴spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
4110𓀴up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--
4111𓀴
4112𓀴“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
4113𓀴but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
4114𓀴that are filled.”
4115𓀴
4116𓀴He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
4117𓀴all the time I remained with him.
4118𓀴
4119𓀴I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
4120𓀴how different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral,
4121𓀴the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let
4122𓀴it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of
4123𓀴Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
4124𓀴to-night shall be sleepless....
4125𓀴
4126𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
4127𓀴
4128𓀴_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
4129𓀴lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
4130𓀴night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
4131𓀴had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
4132𓀴too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
4133𓀴work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
4134𓀴He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
4135𓀴bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
4136𓀴attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
4137𓀴ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
4138𓀴sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
4139𓀴The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
4140𓀴go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
4141𓀴of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through
4142𓀴the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
4143𓀴and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
4144𓀴attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
4145𓀴straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
4146𓀴of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
4147𓀴grounds from those of the deserted house.
4148𓀴
4149𓀴I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
4150𓀴immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
4151𓀴might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
4152𓀴dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure just
4153𓀴disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
4154𓀴far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
4155𓀴ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
4156𓀴one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
4157𓀴I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
4158𓀴bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
4159𓀴is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
4160𓀴take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
4161𓀴him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
4162𓀴in. I heard him say:--
4163𓀴
4164𓀴“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
4165𓀴reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
4166𓀴off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
4167𓀴me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”
4168𓀴
4169𓀴He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
4170𓀴even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
4171𓀴startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
4172𓀴He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
4173𓀴never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
4174𓀴shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
4175𓀴his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
4176𓀴might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
4177𓀴rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat
4178𓀴that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded
4179𓀴room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
4180𓀴more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.
4181𓀴
4182𓀴Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--
4183𓀴
4184𓀴“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!”
4185𓀴
4186𓀴So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
4187𓀴diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.

4197𓀴“_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._
4198𓀴
4199𓀴“My dearest Lucy,--
4200𓀴
4201𓀴“I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
4202𓀴parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
4203𓀴all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
4204𓀴feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
4205𓀴knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
4206𓀴nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
4207𓀴oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out
4208𓀴of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
4209𓀴face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
4210𓀴remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
4211𓀴least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
4212𓀴terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
4213𓀴to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
4214𓀴tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
4215𓀴wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
4216𓀴and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
4217𓀴secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
4218𓀴them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
4219𓀴next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
4220𓀴and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
4221𓀴about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
4222𓀴anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
4223𓀴have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
4224𓀴to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
4225𓀴treat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
4226𓀴poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
4227𓀴_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
4228𓀴felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a
4229𓀴cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
4230𓀴face while he sleeps. He is waking!...
4231𓀴
4232𓀴“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
4233𓀴from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
4234𓀴I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
4235𓀴let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
4236𓀴trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
4237𓀴me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
4238𓀴Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
4239𓀴note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--
4240𓀴
4241𓀴“‘Wilhelmina’--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
4242𓀴never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--‘you know,
4243𓀴dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
4244𓀴secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
4245𓀴think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
4246𓀴was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
4247𓀴fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
4248𓀴know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my
4249𓀴dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
4250𓀴complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
4251𓀴the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
4252𓀴know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
4253𓀴the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fell
4254𓀴back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
4255𓀴have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
4256𓀴afternoon, and am waiting her reply....
4257𓀴
4258𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
4259𓀴
4260𓀴“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
4261𓀴church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
4262𓀴after as Jonathan awakes....
4263𓀴
4264𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
4265𓀴
4266𓀴“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
4267𓀴happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
4268𓀴sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly
4269𓀴and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
4270𓀴words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
4271𓀴shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
4272𓀴I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
4273𓀴chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it
4274𓀴is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’--left me alone
4275𓀴with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
4276𓀴up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
4277𓀴which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
4278𓀴and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
4279𓀴to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
4280𓀴be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
4281𓀴other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
4282𓀴or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
4283𓀴Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it
4284𓀴was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
4285𓀴through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
4286𓀴have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
4287𓀴shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
4288𓀴year.
4289𓀴
4290𓀴“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
4291𓀴happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
4292𓀴except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
4293𓀴and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
4294𓀴and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
4295𓀴pledge between us....
4296𓀴
4297𓀴“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
4298𓀴it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
4299𓀴me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
4300𓀴the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
4301𓀴and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
4302𓀴in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
4303𓀴please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
4304𓀴sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
4305𓀴not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
4306𓀴_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at
4307𓀴once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
4308𓀴is waking--I must attend to my husband!

4344𓀴now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
4345𓀴For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
4346𓀴night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
4347𓀴himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell
4348𓀴me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
4349𓀴strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
4350𓀴from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might
4351𓀴almost say, “cringing”--softness. I was satisfied with his present
4352𓀴condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
4353𓀴but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
4354𓀴thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
4355𓀴coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
4356𓀴furtively at them:--
4357𓀴
4358𓀴“They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!”
4359𓀴
4360𓀴It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
4361𓀴even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
4362𓀴do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
4363𓀴common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
4364𓀴he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
4365𓀴to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the
4366𓀴offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will
4367𓀴only say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
4368𓀴and I can wait; I can wait.”
4369𓀴
4370𓀴After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
4371𓀴until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
4372𓀴length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
4373𓀴him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.

4376𓀴
4377𓀴... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
4378𓀴from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
4379𓀴would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
4380𓀴Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
4381𓀴escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
4382𓀴shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
4383𓀴are required....

4388𓀴life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
4389𓀴subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
4390𓀴thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
4391𓀴future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
4392𓀴orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
4393𓀴when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’s
4394𓀴body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
4395𓀴The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.

4398𓀴
4399𓀴_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
4400𓀴attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
4401𓀴and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
4402𓀴Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
4403𓀴in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
4404𓀴he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
4405𓀴would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
4406𓀴happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
4407𓀴calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
4408𓀴the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
4409𓀴into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
4410𓀴ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
4411𓀴seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
4412𓀴some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
4413𓀴presently said:--
4414𓀴
4415𓀴“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back
4416𓀴to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
4417𓀴not forget this night....

4423𓀴down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will
4424𓀴be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
4425𓀴seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
4426𓀴change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
4427𓀴for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
4428𓀴weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
4429𓀴when he saw me, and I hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder
4430𓀴if I could sleep in mother’s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and
4431𓀴try.

4436𓀴proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
4437𓀴worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
4438𓀴clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
4439𓀴asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
4440𓀴did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
4441𓀴fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
4442𓀴morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
4443𓀴me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don’t seem ever to
4444𓀴get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I
4445𓀴know he will be miserable to see me so.

4451𓀴
4452𓀴“My dear Jack,--
4453𓀴
4454𓀴“I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
4455𓀴disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
4456𓀴asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
4457𓀴disturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state of
4458𓀴health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
4459𓀴spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I
4460𓀴am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. I am
4461𓀴almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I
4462𓀴told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
4463𓀴first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a
4464𓀴painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
4465𓀴I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
4466𓀴Hillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
4467𓀴Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
4468𓀴alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
4469𓀴am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
4470𓀴can after you have seen her. Do not fail!

4484𓀴
4485𓀴“_2 September._
4486𓀴
4487𓀴“My dear old fellow,--
4488𓀴
4489𓀴“With regard to Miss Westenra’s health I hasten to let you know at once
4490𓀴that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
4491𓀴that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
4492𓀴her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
4493𓀴her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
4494𓀴opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
4495𓀴makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
4496𓀴bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
4497𓀴draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
4498𓀴done and propose doing.
4499𓀴
4500𓀴“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
4501𓀴and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
4502𓀴to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
4503𓀴doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
4504𓀴We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
4505𓀴got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
4506𓀴amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
4507𓀴me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
4508𓀴for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
4509𓀴however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
4510𓀴with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
4511𓀴high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
4512𓀴make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--
4513𓀴
4514𓀴“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her
4515𓀴that a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
4516𓀴anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
4517𓀴matter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
4518𓀴myself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.
4519𓀴
4520𓀴“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
4521𓀴the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
4522𓀴quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
4523𓀴gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
4524𓀴slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
4525𓀴a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
4526𓀴analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
4527𓀴itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
4528𓀴satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
4529𓀴cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
4530𓀴mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
4531𓀴times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
4532𓀴regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
4533𓀴used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
4534𓀴and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
4535𓀴Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
4536𓀴returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
4537𓀴have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
4538𓀴Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
4539𓀴world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
4540𓀴were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
4541𓀴relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
4542𓀴your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
4543𓀴her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
4544𓀴reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
4545𓀴wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
4546𓀴what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
4547𓀴and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
4548𓀴and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
4549𓀴nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
4550𓀴self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
4551𓀴kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
4552𓀴noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
4553𓀴practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I
4554𓀴tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
4555𓀴him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
4556𓀴to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
4557𓀴alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.

4574𓀴trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds

4590𓀴
4591𓀴“_3 September._
4592𓀴
4593𓀴“My dear Art,--
4594𓀴
4595𓀴“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
4596𓀴found that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
4597𓀴we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
4598𓀴the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
4599𓀴course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
4600𓀴but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
4601𓀴trust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.
4602𓀴Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
4603𓀴jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked
4604𓀴what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
4605𓀴come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
4606𓀴return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
4607𓀴be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
4608𓀴brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
4609𓀴time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
4610𓀴our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
4611𓀴_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
4612𓀴smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
4613𓀴student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make
4614𓀴it. In any case I am to have a letter.
4615𓀴
4616𓀴“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
4617𓀴saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
4618𓀴ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
4619𓀴very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
4620𓀴feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
4621𓀴struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
4622𓀴look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
4623𓀴all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
4624𓀴geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into
4625𓀴reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
4626𓀴gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--
4627𓀴
4628𓀴“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
4629𓀴much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
4630𓀴see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
4631𓀴ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me
4632𓀴and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
4633𓀴he’--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
4634𓀴which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
4635𓀴particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--‘know anything
4636𓀴of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
4637𓀴back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
4638𓀴oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
4639𓀴young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
4640𓀴themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
4641𓀴sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
4642𓀴smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
4643𓀴to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
4644𓀴professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
4645𓀴said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
4646𓀴cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
4647𓀴been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have
4648𓀴asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
4649𓀴that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
4650𓀴And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
4651𓀴back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
4652𓀴there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well
4653𓀴is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
4654𓀴too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’
4655𓀴
4656𓀴“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
4657𓀴And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
4658𓀴your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
4659𓀴dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
4660𓀴are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
4661𓀴you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
4662𓀴come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
4663𓀴me.”

4666𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
4667𓀴
4668𓀴_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
4669𓀴He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
4670𓀴before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
4671𓀴the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
4672𓀴run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
4673𓀴violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
4674𓀴minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
4675𓀴into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
4676𓀴attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
4677𓀴appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
4678𓀴other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
4679𓀴understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
4680𓀴some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
4681𓀴as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
4682𓀴woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
4683𓀴something directly. I cannot quite understand it.

4686𓀴
4687𓀴_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on
4688𓀴him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
4689𓀴was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
4690𓀴by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
4691𓀴padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
4692𓀴conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
4693𓀴his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
4694𓀴humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
4695𓀴sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
4696𓀴harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
4697𓀴box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
4698𓀴a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
4699𓀴clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
4700𓀴rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
4701𓀴far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--
4702𓀴
4703𓀴“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
4704𓀴it for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
4705𓀴“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more
4706𓀴sugar? I think it would be good for me.”
4707𓀴
4708𓀴“And the flies?” I said.
4709𓀴
4710𓀴“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
4711𓀴it.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
4712𓀴not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
4713𓀴as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.
4714𓀴
4715𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
4716𓀴
4717𓀴_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
4718𓀴whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
4719𓀴own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
4720𓀴his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
4721𓀴the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
4722𓀴beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
4723𓀴and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
4724𓀴water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
4725𓀴building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
4726𓀴to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
4727𓀴his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
4728𓀴frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
4729𓀴inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
4730𓀴recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
4731𓀴quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
4732𓀴hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
4733𓀴over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
4734𓀴fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
4735𓀴the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
4736𓀴me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”
4737𓀴
4738𓀴“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a
4739𓀴wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
4740𓀴mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
4741𓀴after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
4742𓀴and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
4743𓀴periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
4744𓀴We shall see.

4771𓀴“_6 September._
4772𓀴
4773𓀴“My dear Art,--
4774𓀴
4775𓀴“My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
4776𓀴There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
4777𓀴Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
4778𓀴professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
4779𓀴her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
4780𓀴stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
4781𓀴myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
4782𓀴shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak
4783𓀴condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
4784𓀴difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
4785𓀴come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
4786𓀴do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
4787𓀴news. In haste
4788𓀴
4789𓀴“Yours ever,
4790𓀴
4791𓀴“JOHN SEWARD.”

4793𓀴
4794𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
4795𓀴
4796𓀴_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
4797𓀴Liverpool Street was:--
4798𓀴
4799𓀴“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
4800𓀴
4801𓀴“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
4802𓀴wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
4803𓀴Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”
4804𓀴
4805𓀴“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;
4806𓀴perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
4807𓀴shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
4808𓀴with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
4809𓀴as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,
4810𓀴too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
4811𓀴you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
4812𓀴in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
4813𓀴and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He
4814𓀴touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
4815𓀴the same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
4816𓀴unfold to you.”
4817𓀴
4818𓀴“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some
4819𓀴decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:--
4820𓀴
4821𓀴“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
4822𓀴ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
4823𓀴has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
4824𓀴ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
4825𓀴and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the
4826𓀴time comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
4827𓀴he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
4828𓀴he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell
4829𓀴you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
4830𓀴good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
4831𓀴the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
4832𓀴the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
4833𓀴and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
4834𓀴there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke
4835𓀴off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
4836𓀴gravely:--
4837𓀴
4838𓀴“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
4839𓀴full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
4840𓀴I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
4841𓀴knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
4842𓀴Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
4843𓀴case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such
4844𓀴interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
4845𓀴beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
4846𓀴small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
4847𓀴Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
4848𓀴learn from failure, not from success!”
4849𓀴
4850𓀴When I described Lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
4851𓀴more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
4852𓀴bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia
4853𓀴of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
4854𓀴equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
4855𓀴Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
4856𓀴expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
4857𓀴that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
4858𓀴where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
4859𓀴cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
4860𓀴daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is
4861𓀴something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
4862𓀴envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
4863𓀴which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
4864𓀴selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
4865𓀴of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
4866𓀴knowledge of.
4867𓀴
4868𓀴I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
4869𓀴a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
4870𓀴more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
4871𓀴I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
4872𓀴shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
4873𓀴was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
4874𓀴red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
4875𓀴her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
4876𓀴hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
4877𓀴till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
4878𓀴seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
4879𓀴Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
4880𓀴instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
4881𓀴the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
4882𓀴closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time
4883𓀴to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s
4884𓀴action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
4885𓀴it you or me?”
4886𓀴
4887𓀴“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”
4888𓀴
4889𓀴“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”
4890𓀴
4891𓀴I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
4892𓀴the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
4893𓀴door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
4894𓀴an eager whisper:--
4895𓀴
4896𓀴“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
4897𓀴have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
4898𓀴myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
4899𓀴sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had
4900𓀴been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
4901𓀴his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
4902𓀴seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
4903𓀴him gravely as he held out his hand:--
4904𓀴
4905𓀴“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
4906𓀴bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he
4907𓀴suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to
4908𓀴help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
4909𓀴best help.”
4910𓀴
4911𓀴“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My
4912𓀴life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
4913𓀴her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
4914𓀴knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--
4915𓀴
4916𓀴“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!”
4917𓀴
4918𓀴“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
4919𓀴quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”
4920𓀴he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
4921𓀴me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the
4922𓀴Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--
4923𓀴
4924𓀴“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
4925𓀴or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
4926𓀴what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
4927𓀴the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
4928𓀴the more young and strong than me”--here Arthur took my hand and wrung
4929𓀴it hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
4930𓀴old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
4931𓀴so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him
4932𓀴and said:--
4933𓀴
4934𓀴“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
4935𓀴understand----”
4936𓀴
4937𓀴He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.
4938𓀴
4939𓀴“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
4940𓀴that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
4941𓀴shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
4942𓀴must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
4943𓀴her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”
4944𓀴
4945𓀴We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
4946𓀴Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
4947𓀴asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
4948𓀴to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
4949𓀴them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
4950𓀴coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--
4951𓀴
4952𓀴“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
4953𓀴child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made
4954𓀴the effort with success.
4955𓀴
4956𓀴It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
4957𓀴the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
4958𓀴flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
4959𓀴its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
4960𓀴satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
4961𓀴coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
4962𓀴over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst
4963𓀴he bent over her.
4964𓀴
4965𓀴Van Helsing turning to me, said:
4966𓀴
4967𓀴“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
4968𓀴defibrinate it.”
4969𓀴
4970𓀴Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
4971𓀴operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
4972𓀴back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy
4973𓀴of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
4974𓀴anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
4975𓀴was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must
4976𓀴have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
4977𓀴But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
4978𓀴his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
4979𓀴heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.
4980𓀴It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I
4981𓀴could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
4982𓀴arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the
4983𓀴man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--
4984𓀴
4985𓀴“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
4986𓀴presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
4987𓀴pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
4988𓀴which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
4989𓀴diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
4990𓀴and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
4991𓀴could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s
4992𓀴ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
4993𓀴me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
4994𓀴wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
4995𓀴much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
4996𓀴his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
4997𓀴that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
4998𓀴the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
4999𓀴can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
5000𓀴her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
5001𓀴have done. Good-bye.”
5002𓀴
5003𓀴When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
5004𓀴but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
5005𓀴breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
5006𓀴The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
5007𓀴whisper:--
5008𓀴
5009𓀴“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
5010𓀴
5011𓀴“What do you make of it?”
5012𓀴
5013𓀴“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded
5014𓀴to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
5015𓀴punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
5016𓀴disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
5017𓀴trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
5018𓀴was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
5019𓀴the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
5020𓀴would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
5021𓀴have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
5022𓀴
5023𓀴“Well?” said Van Helsing.
5024𓀴
5025𓀴“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I
5026𓀴must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and
5027𓀴things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
5028𓀴must not let your sight pass from her.”
5029𓀴
5030𓀴“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.
5031𓀴
5032𓀴“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
5033𓀴she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
5034𓀴the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
5035𓀴possible. And then we may begin.”
5036𓀴
5037𓀴“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”
5038𓀴
5039𓀴“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
5040𓀴later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
5041𓀴up:--
5042𓀴
5043𓀴“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
5044𓀴shall not sleep easy hereafter!”

5047𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary--continued._
5048𓀴
5049𓀴_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
5050𓀴off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
5051𓀴from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
5052𓀴and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
5053𓀴absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
5054𓀴that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
5055𓀴almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed
5056𓀴strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
5057𓀴preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
5058𓀴night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
5059𓀴the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
5060𓀴gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
5061𓀴sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
5062𓀴and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
5063𓀴and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
5064𓀴did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--
5065𓀴
5066𓀴“You do not want to go to sleep?”
5067𓀴
5068𓀴“No; I am afraid.”
5069𓀴
5070𓀴“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”
5071𓀴
5072𓀴“Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”
5073𓀴
5074𓀴“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”
5075𓀴
5076𓀴“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All
5077𓀴this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”
5078𓀴
5079𓀴“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
5080𓀴I can promise that nothing will happen.”
5081𓀴
5082𓀴“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise
5083𓀴you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”
5084𓀴
5085𓀴“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
5086𓀴sleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
5087𓀴back, asleep.
5088𓀴
5089𓀴All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
5090𓀴in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
5091𓀴slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
5092𓀴pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
5093𓀴dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
5094𓀴
5095𓀴In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
5096𓀴myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
5097𓀴wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
5098𓀴of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
5099𓀴day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
5100𓀴zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
5101𓀴past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
5102𓀴I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as
5103𓀴it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
5104𓀴night mail and would join me early in the morning.

5107𓀴
5108𓀴_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
5109𓀴Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
5110𓀴brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
5111𓀴exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
5112𓀴with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--
5113𓀴
5114𓀴“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
5115𓀴again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
5116𓀴will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my
5117𓀴supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
5118𓀴made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
5119𓀴excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
5120𓀴her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay
5121𓀴here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
5122𓀴sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
5123𓀴bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
5124𓀴shall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but
5125𓀴acquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.
5126𓀴So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
5127𓀴I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.

5131𓀴
5132𓀴_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
5133𓀴that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
5134𓀴a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
5135𓀴very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
5136𓀴it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
5137𓀴eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
5138𓀴rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
5139𓀴where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
5140𓀴must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
5141𓀴last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
5142𓀴And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
5143𓀴within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
5144𓀴Good-night, Arthur.

5146𓀴
5147𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
5148𓀴
5149𓀴_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and
5150𓀴started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
5151𓀴in an asylum, at any rate.
5152𓀴
5153𓀴“And how is our patient?”
5154𓀴
5155𓀴“Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.
5156𓀴
5157𓀴“Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.
5158𓀴
5159𓀴The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
5160𓀴Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
5161𓀴
5162𓀴As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
5163𓀴heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
5164𓀴deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
5165𓀴his exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from
5166𓀴his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
5167𓀴iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.
5168𓀴
5169𓀴There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
5170𓀴white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
5171𓀴seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
5172𓀴corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
5173𓀴in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
5174𓀴stood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring
5175𓀴the brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
5176𓀴He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
5177𓀴wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
5178𓀴suspense said:--
5179𓀴
5180𓀴“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
5181𓀴undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
5182𓀴to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was
5183𓀴dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
5184𓀴had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
5185𓀴possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
5186𓀴without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did
5187𓀴not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no
5188𓀴matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing
5189𓀴held up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with
5190𓀴growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
5191𓀴danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
5192𓀴of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
5193𓀴intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
5194𓀴subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
5195𓀴that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
5196𓀴cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
5197𓀴feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
5198𓀴
5199𓀴The Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?”
5200𓀴I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which he
5201𓀴smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--
5202𓀴
5203𓀴“He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her
5204𓀴and for others; and the present will suffice.”
5205𓀴
5206𓀴When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
5207𓀴digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
5208𓀴leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
5209𓀴he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
5210𓀴myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
5211𓀴whispered:--
5212𓀴
5213𓀴“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
5214𓀴unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
5215𓀴enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”
5216𓀴
5217𓀴When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--
5218𓀴
5219𓀴“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
5220𓀴rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
5221𓀴
5222𓀴I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
5223𓀴had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
5224𓀴felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
5225𓀴what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
5226𓀴and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
5227𓀴she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
5228𓀴show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
5229𓀴sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
5230𓀴punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
5231𓀴edges--tiny though they were.
5232𓀴
5233𓀴Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
5234𓀴strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
5235𓀴had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
5236𓀴injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
5237𓀴voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
5238𓀴
5239𓀴Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
5240𓀴had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
5241𓀴came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
5242𓀴said to me gratefully:--
5243𓀴
5244𓀴“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
5245𓀴must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
5246𓀴yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
5247𓀴do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
5248𓀴for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
5249𓀴drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
5250𓀴imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
5251𓀴lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
5252𓀴
5253𓀴Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
5254𓀴“Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
5255𓀴stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
5256𓀴I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
5257𓀴reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
5258𓀴even the most not-probable. Good-night.”
5259𓀴
5260𓀴In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
5261𓀴them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
5262𓀴when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit
5263𓀴up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign
5264𓀴gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
5265𓀴I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that
5266𓀴their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
5267𓀴similar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a
5268𓀴late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
5269𓀴for sleep. It is coming.

5272𓀴
5273𓀴_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
5274𓀴Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
5275𓀴arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
5276𓀴with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of
5277𓀴white flowers.
5278𓀴
5279𓀴“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.
5280𓀴
5281𓀴“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”
5282𓀴
5283𓀴“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here
5284𓀴Lucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
5285𓀴in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
5286𓀴point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
5287𓀴so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
5288𓀴that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
5289𓀴you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
5290𓀴hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
5291𓀴lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
5292𓀴of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
5293𓀴for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”
5294𓀴
5295𓀴Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
5296𓀴them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
5297𓀴half-disgust:--
5298𓀴
5299𓀴“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
5300𓀴these flowers are only common garlic.”
5301𓀴
5302𓀴To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
5303𓀴iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--
5304𓀴
5305𓀴“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
5306𓀴and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
5307𓀴others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
5308𓀴well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
5309𓀴me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
5310𓀴common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
5311𓀴wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
5312𓀴inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
5313𓀴and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
5314𓀴for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
5315𓀴help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
5316𓀴where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
5317𓀴I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”
5318𓀴
5319𓀴We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s
5320𓀴actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
5321𓀴that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
5322𓀴securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
5323𓀴the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
5324𓀴in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
5325𓀴all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
5326𓀴the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
5327𓀴presently I said:--
5328𓀴
5329𓀴“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
5330𓀴this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
5331𓀴would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
5332𓀴
5333𓀴“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
5334𓀴Lucy was to wear round her neck.
5335𓀴
5336𓀴We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
5337𓀴was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
5338𓀴neck. The last words he said to her were:--
5339𓀴
5340𓀴“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
5341𓀴not to-night open the window or the door.”
5342𓀴
5343𓀴“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all
5344𓀴your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
5345𓀴friends?”
5346𓀴
5347𓀴As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--
5348𓀴
5349𓀴“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,
5350𓀴much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
5351𓀴and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
5352𓀴you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
5353𓀴more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”
5354𓀴
5355𓀴He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
5356𓀴before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
5357𓀴have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
5358𓀴I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.

5366𓀴
5367𓀴
5368𓀴_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
5369𓀴Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
5370𓀴positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
5371𓀴right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
5372𓀴being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
5373𓀴mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
5374𓀴have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
5375𓀴or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
5376𓀴for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
5377𓀴dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
5378𓀴nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
5379𓀴and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden
5380𓀴strewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
5381𓀴There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,
5382𓀴everybody.

5385𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
5386𓀴
5387𓀴_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
5388𓀴up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
5389𓀴Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.
5390𓀴
5391𓀴Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
5392𓀴eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
5393𓀴fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s
5394𓀴annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
5395𓀴but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
5396𓀴Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
5397𓀴riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--
5398𓀴
5399𓀴“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
5400𓀴asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
5401𓀴should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
5402𓀴rubbed his hands together, and said:--
5403𓀴
5404𓀴“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to
5405𓀴which she answered:--
5406𓀴
5407𓀴“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this
5408𓀴morning is due in part to me.”
5409𓀴
5410𓀴“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.
5411𓀴
5412𓀴“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
5413𓀴her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
5414𓀴not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
5415𓀴horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
5416𓀴a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
5417𓀴too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
5418𓀴and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
5419𓀴pleased with her, I am sure.”
5420𓀴
5421𓀴She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
5422𓀴she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen
5423𓀴grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
5424𓀴was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
5425𓀴he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
5426𓀴her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
5427𓀴forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
5428𓀴
5429𓀴Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
5430𓀴raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
5431𓀴his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
5432𓀴and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
5433𓀴that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
5434𓀴his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!
5435𓀴God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
5436𓀴we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
5437𓀴pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
5438𓀴mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
5439𓀴thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
5440𓀴must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
5441𓀴beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he
5442𓀴jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils
5443𓀴or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
5444𓀴all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
5445𓀴went up to Lucy’s room.
5446𓀴
5447𓀴Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
5448𓀴This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
5449𓀴awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
5450𓀴infinite pity.
5451𓀴
5452𓀴“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
5453𓀴meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
5454𓀴began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
5455𓀴operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
5456𓀴necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
5457𓀴warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
5458𓀴You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
5459𓀴up his shirt-sleeve.
5460𓀴
5461𓀴Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
5462𓀴the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
5463𓀴watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.
5464𓀴
5465𓀴Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
5466𓀴not remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the
5467𓀴flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
5468𓀴was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
5469𓀴himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
5470𓀴send me word when to come.
5471𓀴
5472𓀴After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
5473𓀴seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
5474𓀴
5475𓀴What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
5476𓀴amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.

5480𓀴
5481𓀴_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
5482𓀴again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
5483𓀴long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
5484𓀴feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
5485𓀴half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
5486𓀴in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
5487𓀴more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
5488𓀴life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
5489𓀴however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
5490𓀴to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
5491𓀴wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
5492𓀴so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
5493𓀴commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now
5494𓀴without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
5495𓀴quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
5496𓀴Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
5497𓀴day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
5498𓀴alone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our
5499𓀴friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
5500𓀴last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
5501𓀴him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
5502𓀴although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
5503𓀴the window-panes.

5511𓀴
5512𓀴         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._
5513𓀴
5514𓀴After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
5515𓀴the words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
5516𓀴the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf
5517𓀴department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
5518𓀴the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
5519𓀴his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
5520𓀴elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
5521𓀴hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
5522𓀴comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”
5523𓀴until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
5524𓀴table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--
5525𓀴
5526𓀴“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me
5527𓀴refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
5528𓀴wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
5529𓀴I begins to arsk them questions.”
5530𓀴
5531𓀴“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him
5532𓀴into a talkative humour.
5533𓀴
5534𓀴“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of
5535𓀴their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf
5536𓀴to their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with a pole
5537𓀴afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their
5538𓀴sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
5539𓀴ear-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of
5540𓀴the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ and
5541𓀴arskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that
5542𓀴only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d
5543𓀴answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to
5544𓀴arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
5545𓀴did I tell yer to go to ’ell?”
5546𓀴
5547𓀴“You did.”
5548𓀴
5549𓀴“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that
5550𓀴was ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I
5551𓀴weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owl
5552𓀴as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, now
5553𓀴that the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed
5554𓀴me out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratch
5555𓀴my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me.
5556𓀴Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere
5557𓀴escaped wolf.”
5558𓀴
5559𓀴“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
5560𓀴happened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you
5561𓀴consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
5562𓀴end.”
5563𓀴
5564𓀴“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf
5565𓀴what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
5566𓀴Norway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
5567𓀴nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more
5568𓀴surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the
5569𓀴place. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”
5570𓀴
5571𓀴“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’s
5572𓀴got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf
5573𓀴’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”
5574𓀴
5575𓀴“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first
5576𓀴hear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a
5577𓀴young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem
5578𓀴away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the
5579𓀴bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that
5580𓀴day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook
5581𓀴nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He
5582𓀴had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
5583𓀴for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad white
5584𓀴kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
5585𓀴‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’
5586𓀴
5587𓀴“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
5588𓀴’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind
5589𓀴of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they
5590𓀴wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.
5591𓀴
5592𓀴“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a
5593𓀴bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a
5594𓀴bagful.’
5595𓀴
5596𓀴“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they
5597𓀴lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
5598𓀴same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put
5599𓀴in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!
5600𓀴
5601𓀴“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’
5602𓀴
5603𓀴“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’
5604𓀴
5605𓀴“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a
5606𓀴man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.
5607𓀴
5608𓀴“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of
5609𓀴several.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks
5610𓀴away. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,
5611𓀴and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole
5612𓀴hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
5613𓀴here all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.
5614𓀴There warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a
5615𓀴dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
5616𓀴I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling
5617𓀴stopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look round afore
5618𓀴turnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker’s
5619𓀴cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
5620𓀴that’s all I know for certing.”
5621𓀴
5622𓀴“Did any one else see anything?”
5623𓀴
5624𓀴“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,
5625𓀴when he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. At
5626𓀴least, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did ’e
5627𓀴never said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was
5628𓀴only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
5629𓀴night-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein’
5630𓀴anything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”
5631𓀴
5632𓀴“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
5633𓀴wolf?”
5634𓀴
5635𓀴“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can;
5636𓀴but I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”
5637𓀴
5638𓀴“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
5639𓀴experience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”
5640𓀴
5641𓀴“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere
5642𓀴wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.”
5643𓀴
5644𓀴From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
5645𓀴could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
5646𓀴explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage
5647𓀴with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
5648𓀴so I said:--
5649𓀴
5650𓀴“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
5651𓀴and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me
5652𓀴what you think will happen.”
5653𓀴
5654𓀴“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for
5655𓀴a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
5656𓀴as telling me to go on.”
5657𓀴
5658𓀴“Well, I never!” said the old lady.
5659𓀴
5660𓀴“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The
5661𓀴gard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster
5662𓀴than a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
5663𓀴wolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that
5664𓀴way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
5665𓀴in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is
5666𓀴they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
5667𓀴Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
5668𓀴clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
5669𓀴’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for
5670𓀴hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’
5671𓀴a-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get
5672𓀴his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a
5673𓀴coal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his
5674𓀴green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s
5675𓀴bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s
5676𓀴shop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with
5677𓀴a soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I
5678𓀴shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s
5679𓀴all.”
5680𓀴
5681𓀴I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
5682𓀴against the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length
5683𓀴with surprise.
5684𓀴
5685𓀴“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by
5686𓀴’isself!”
5687𓀴
5688𓀴He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
5689𓀴seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
5690𓀴well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
5691𓀴personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
5692𓀴
5693𓀴After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
5694𓀴his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
5695𓀴itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
5696𓀴picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her
5697𓀴confidence in masquerade.
5698𓀴
5699𓀴The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
5700𓀴wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
5701𓀴children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
5702𓀴penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
5703𓀴prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
5704𓀴solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--
5705𓀴
5706𓀴“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
5707𓀴didn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken

5712𓀴He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
5713𓀴satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
5714𓀴fatted calf, and went off to report.
5715𓀴
5716𓀴I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
5717𓀴to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.

5720𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
5721𓀴
5722𓀴_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
5723𓀴books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
5724𓀴had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
5725𓀴rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
5726𓀴thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
5727𓀴into the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s
5728𓀴pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
5729𓀴as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
5730𓀴too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
5731𓀴balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
5732𓀴Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
5733𓀴sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
5734𓀴little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
5735𓀴intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
5736𓀴keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
5737𓀴attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
5738𓀴positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
5739𓀴up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
5740𓀴easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
5741𓀴placidly, simply repeating over and over again: “The blood is the life!
5742𓀴The blood is the life!”
5743𓀴
5744𓀴I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
5745𓀴late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’s
5746𓀴illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
5747𓀴weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
5748𓀴me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without
5749𓀴it.

5765𓀴_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
5766𓀴Helsing’s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know
5767𓀴by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
5768𓀴possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely
5769𓀴there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
5770𓀴should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
5771𓀴me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy’s phonograph.

5774𓀴_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._
5775𓀴
5776𓀴_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
5777𓀴one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
5778𓀴record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
5779𓀴have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
5780𓀴doing.
5781𓀴
5782𓀴I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
5783𓀴Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
5784𓀴
5785𓀴I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
5786𓀴sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
5787𓀴know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
5788𓀴the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have
5789𓀴called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
5790𓀴the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
5791𓀴would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
5792𓀴alone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” There
5793𓀴was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
5794𓀴Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, but
5795𓀴more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
5796𓀴see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
5797𓀴wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
5798𓀴not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
5799𓀴seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
5800𓀴said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--
5801𓀴
5802𓀴“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
5803𓀴right.”
5804𓀴
5805𓀴I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
5806𓀴and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
5807𓀴not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
5808𓀴and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
5809𓀴hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
5810𓀴startled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I tried
5811𓀴to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
5812𓀴hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
5813𓀴the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
5814𓀴crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
5815𓀴The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
5816𓀴aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
5817𓀴wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
5818𓀴posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
5819𓀴other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
5820𓀴insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
5821𓀴second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
5822𓀴and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
5823𓀴with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
5824𓀴moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
5825𓀴eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
5826𓀴myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
5827𓀴window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
5828𓀴travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
5829𓀴stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,
5830𓀴which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
5831𓀴beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.
5832𓀴
5833𓀴The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
5834𓀴consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
5835𓀴dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
5836𓀴seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
5837𓀴stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
5838𓀴nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
5839𓀴me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
5840𓀴their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
5841𓀴came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
5842𓀴over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
5843𓀴broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
5844𓀴dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
5845𓀴had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
5846𓀴to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
5847𓀴open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
5848𓀴in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
5849𓀴mother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
5850𓀴had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would
5851𓀴have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
5852𓀴the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
5853𓀴to the dining-room to look for them.
5854𓀴
5855𓀴My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
5856𓀴on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
5857𓀴half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
5858𓀴and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
5859𓀴sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for
5860𓀴her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
5861𓀴in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
5862𓀴the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
5863𓀴dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
5864𓀴broken window.
5865𓀴
5866𓀴The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
5867𓀴the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
5868𓀴shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
5869𓀴where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
5870𓀴gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
5871𓀴survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!

5876𓀴CHAPTER XII
5877𓀴
5878𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
5879𓀴
5880𓀴
5881𓀴_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
5882𓀴Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
5883𓀴and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
5884𓀴mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
5885𓀴finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
5886𓀴the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
5887𓀴hour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
5888𓀴more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
5889𓀴the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
5890𓀴desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
5891𓀴tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
5892𓀴late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
5893𓀴danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
5894𓀴and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
5895𓀴anywhere.
5896𓀴
5897𓀴I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
5898𓀴locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
5899𓀴rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the
5900𓀴gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
5901𓀴When he saw me, he gasped out:--
5902𓀴
5903𓀴“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
5904𓀴not get my telegram?”
5905𓀴
5906𓀴I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
5907𓀴telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
5908𓀴and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
5909𓀴raised his hat as he said solemnly:--
5910𓀴
5911𓀴“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual
5912𓀴recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get
5913𓀴in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”
5914𓀴
5915𓀴We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
5916𓀴window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
5917𓀴handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
5918𓀴attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
5919𓀴with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
5920𓀴opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
5921𓀴was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at
5922𓀴hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
5923𓀴dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
5924𓀴servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
5925𓀴for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
5926𓀴room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
5927𓀴each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”
5928𓀴Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the
5929𓀴door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
5930𓀴faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
5931𓀴room.
5932𓀴
5933𓀴How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
5934𓀴mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
5935𓀴sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
5936𓀴broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
5937𓀴fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
5938𓀴drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
5939𓀴mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
5940𓀴which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
5941𓀴Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
5942𓀴poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
5943𓀴listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--
5944𓀴
5945𓀴“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”
5946𓀴
5947𓀴I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
5948𓀴it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
5949𓀴on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
5950𓀴fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
5951𓀴but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
5952𓀴occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
5953𓀴hands. He said to me:--
5954𓀴
5955𓀴“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
5956𓀴Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
5957𓀴get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
5958𓀴that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
5959𓀴more.”
5960𓀴
5961𓀴I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
5962𓀴women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
5963𓀴affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
5964𓀴sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
5965𓀴them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
5966𓀴them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
5967𓀴was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
5968𓀴Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
5969𓀴as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
5970𓀴boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
5971𓀴got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
5972𓀴we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
5973𓀴of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
5974𓀴she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
5975𓀴with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
5976𓀴must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
5977𓀴and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.
5978𓀴
5979𓀴I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
5980𓀴earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,
5981𓀴and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
5982𓀴understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--
5983𓀴
5984𓀴“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
5985𓀴away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went
5986𓀴on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
5987𓀴
5988𓀴Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
5989𓀴be of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
5990𓀴stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s
5991𓀴face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
5992𓀴a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--
5993𓀴
5994𓀴“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”
5995𓀴
5996𓀴We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
5997𓀴her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
5998𓀴that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
5999𓀴still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
6000𓀴ever seen her.
6001𓀴
6002𓀴Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
6003𓀴and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
6004𓀴out of the room.
6005𓀴
6006𓀴“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the
6007𓀴stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
6008𓀴closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
6009𓀴the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
6010𓀴death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
6011𓀴observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
6012𓀴enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved
6013𓀴by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
6014𓀴something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--
6015𓀴
6016𓀴“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
6017𓀴another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life
6018𓀴won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
6019𓀴exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
6020𓀴courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
6021𓀴veins for her?”
6022𓀴
6023𓀴“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”
6024𓀴
6025𓀴The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
6026𓀴relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
6027𓀴Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
6028𓀴glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and
6029𓀴rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
6030𓀴
6031𓀴“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.
6032𓀴
6033𓀴“I guess Art is the cause.”
6034𓀴
6035𓀴He handed me a telegram:--
6036𓀴
6037𓀴“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
6038𓀴Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
6039𓀴Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.”
6040𓀴
6041𓀴“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
6042𓀴me what to do.”
6043𓀴
6044𓀴Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
6045𓀴the eyes as he said:--
6046𓀴
6047𓀴“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
6048𓀴trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
6049𓀴us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”
6050𓀴
6051𓀴Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
6052𓀴to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
6053𓀴told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
6054𓀴veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
6055𓀴occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
6056𓀴and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
6057𓀴Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
6058𓀴good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
6059𓀴whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
6060𓀴to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
6061𓀴after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
6062𓀴breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
6063𓀴Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
6064𓀴two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
6065𓀴thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
6066𓀴of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
6067𓀴He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when
6068𓀴we carried her to the bath.”
6069𓀴
6070𓀴When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
6071𓀴asked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
6072𓀴mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I
6073𓀴did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
6074𓀴paper, saying:--
6075𓀴
6076𓀴“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
6077𓀴and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
6078𓀴is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I
6079𓀴was all myself again.
6080𓀴
6081𓀴“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
6082𓀴properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
6083𓀴to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
6084𓀴had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
6085𓀴know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
6086𓀴had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
6087𓀴fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
6088𓀴registrar and go on to the undertaker.”
6089𓀴
6090𓀴“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
6091𓀴sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
6092𓀴love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
6093𓀴man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
6094𓀴more for it! Now go.”
6095𓀴
6096𓀴In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
6097𓀴that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
6098𓀴going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
6099𓀴where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--
6100𓀴
6101𓀴“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
6102𓀴ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
6103𓀴the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
6104𓀴the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
6105𓀴
6106𓀴When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
6107𓀴as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
6108𓀴sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
6109𓀴side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
6110𓀴expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
6111𓀴So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
6112𓀴the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
6113𓀴rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
6114𓀴to me:--
6115𓀴
6116𓀴“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no
6117𓀴right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
6118𓀴and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t
6119𓀴help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong
6120𓀴with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
6121𓀴that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
6122𓀴_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
6123𓀴Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man
6124𓀴must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
6125𓀴no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
6126𓀴so?”
6127𓀴
6128𓀴“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:--
6129𓀴
6130𓀴“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
6131𓀴to-day. Is not that so?”
6132𓀴
6133𓀴“That’s so.”
6134𓀴
6135𓀴“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
6136𓀴own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
6137𓀴since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
6138𓀴all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
6139𓀴her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
6140𓀴wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
6141𓀴bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
6142𓀴betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spoke
6143𓀴the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
6144𓀴regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
6145𓀴mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
6146𓀴heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
6147𓀴royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
6148𓀴answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
6149𓀴Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
6150𓀴so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
6151𓀴in the same phrase: “That’s so.”
6152𓀴
6153𓀴“And how long has this been going on?”
6154𓀴
6155𓀴“About ten days.”
6156𓀴
6157𓀴“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
6158𓀴that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
6159𓀴of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then,
6160𓀴coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it
6161𓀴out?”
6162𓀴
6163𓀴I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
6164𓀴frantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a guess.
6165𓀴There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
6166𓀴all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
6167𓀴not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.” Quincey held
6168𓀴out his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the Dutchman will tell me
6169𓀴what to do, and I’ll do it.”
6170𓀴
6171𓀴When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel
6172𓀴in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
6173𓀴had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
6174𓀴come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
6175𓀴Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
6176𓀴and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
6177𓀴poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
6178𓀴meant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried
6179𓀴what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
6180𓀴she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
6181𓀴a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
6182𓀴her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
6183𓀴into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
6184𓀴took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
6185𓀴over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
6186𓀴with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
6187𓀴hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
6188𓀴the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
6189𓀴if in thought, but he said nothing.

6192𓀴
6193𓀴_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
6194𓀴to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
6195𓀴I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
6196𓀴unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
6197𓀴that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.
6198𓀴
6199𓀴When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy’s
6200𓀴strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
6201𓀴nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
6202𓀴slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
6203𓀴sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
6204𓀴haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
6205𓀴gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
6206𓀴sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
6207𓀴changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
6208𓀴one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
6209𓀴Quincey went off to meet him at the station.
6210𓀴
6211𓀴When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full
6212𓀴and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
6213𓀴colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
6214𓀴with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
6215𓀴the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
6216𓀴grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
6217𓀴were shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a
6218𓀴stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
6219𓀴had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
6220𓀴cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.
6221𓀴
6222𓀴It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
6223𓀴her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
6224𓀴this on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. I
6225𓀴fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
6226𓀴great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.

6232𓀴
6233𓀴“_17 September._
6234𓀴
6235𓀴“My dearest Lucy,--
6236𓀴
6237𓀴“It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
6238𓀴will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
6239𓀴budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
6240𓀴at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
6241𓀴an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
6242𓀴were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
6243𓀴dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--
6244𓀴
6245𓀴“‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
6246𓀴blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
6247𓀴love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
6248𓀴with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
6249𓀴my will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
6250𓀴the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.
6251𓀴
6252𓀴“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
6253𓀴bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
6254𓀴close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
6255𓀴stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
6256𓀴cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
6257𓀴rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
6258𓀴housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
6259𓀴Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
6260𓀴clients.
6261𓀴
6262𓀴“How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
6263𓀴day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
6264𓀴shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
6265𓀴put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
6266𓀴long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
6267𓀴way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
6268𓀴placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
6269𓀴days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
6270𓀴I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
6271𓀴and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
6272𓀴and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
6273𓀴dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
6274𓀴you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
6275𓀴‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from the
6276𓀴junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
6277𓀴love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
6278𓀴of the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead. Good-bye, my dearest
6279𓀴Lucy, and all blessings on you.

6287𓀴etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._
6288𓀴
6289𓀴“_20 September._
6290𓀴
6291𓀴“My dear Sir,--
6292𓀴
6293𓀴“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
6294𓀴everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
6295𓀴is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
6296𓀴dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
6297𓀴with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two men
6298𓀴made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
6299𓀴which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
6300𓀴our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
6301𓀴myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
6302𓀴saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
6303𓀴Renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
6304𓀴him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
6305𓀴decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a
6306𓀴foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
6307𓀴wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
6308𓀴swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
6309𓀴so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
6310𓀴mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless
6311𓀴yer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I
6312𓀴pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wild
6313𓀴beast like that.’ Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
6314𓀴where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
6315𓀴and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
6316𓀴make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
6317𓀴well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
6318𓀴ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
6319𓀴genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
6320𓀴blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
6321𓀴that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
6322𓀴say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
6323𓀴hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
6324𓀴window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
6325𓀴attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
6326𓀴on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
6327𓀴had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
6328𓀴boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
6329𓀴face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
6330𓀴patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
6331𓀴knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
6332𓀴moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
6333𓀴fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
6334𓀴heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
6335𓀴seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
6336𓀴fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
6337𓀴were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
6338𓀴began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat
6339𓀴on him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me!
6340𓀴they shan’t murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ and
6341𓀴all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
6342𓀴difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
6343𓀴room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
6344𓀴it all right; and he is going on well.
6345𓀴
6346𓀴“The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
6347𓀴damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
6348𓀴threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
6349𓀴the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
6350𓀴had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
6351𓀴raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
6352𓀴him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
6353𓀴state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
6354𓀴their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
6355𓀴labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
6356𓀴drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
6357𓀴with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
6358𓀴that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
6359𓀴meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took their
6360𓀴names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
6361𓀴follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great
6362𓀴Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
6363𓀴Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
6364𓀴Shipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.
6365𓀴
6366𓀴“I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
6367𓀴wire you at once if there is anything of importance.
6368𓀴
6369𓀴“Believe me, dear Sir,
6370𓀴
6371𓀴“Yours faithfully,

6381𓀴
6382𓀴“My dearest Lucy,--
6383𓀴
6384𓀴“Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
6385𓀴Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
6386𓀴that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
6387𓀴father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me.
6388𓀴Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
6389𓀴deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
6390𓀴and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
6391𓀴fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
6392𓀴dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
6393𓀴amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
6394𓀴begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
6395𓀴helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
6396𓀴shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
6397𓀴that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
6398𓀴enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master
6399𓀴in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
6400𓀴strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
6401𓀴the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
6402𓀴for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
6403𓀴tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
6404𓀴up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.
6405𓀴Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
6406𓀴father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
6407𓀴mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
6408𓀴minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,
6409𓀴

6415𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
6416𓀴
6417𓀴_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
6418𓀴to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
6419𓀴and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
6420𓀴this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
6421𓀴been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy’s mother
6422𓀴and Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.
6423𓀴
6424𓀴I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
6425𓀴go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
6426𓀴that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
6427𓀴all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
6428𓀴to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said;
6429𓀴“come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
6430𓀴mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
6431𓀴must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
6432𓀴Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
6433𓀴sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
6434𓀴be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
6435𓀴sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s
6436𓀴face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
6437𓀴quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
6438𓀴should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
6439𓀴as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
6440𓀴window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk
6441𓀴handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
6442𓀴the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
6443𓀴her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
6444𓀴teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
6445𓀴had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
6446𓀴canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
6447𓀴and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
6448𓀴of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
6449𓀴and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
6450𓀴and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
6451𓀴round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
6452𓀴and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
6453𓀴I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
6454𓀴flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
6455𓀴watching her.
6456𓀴
6457𓀴Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
6458𓀴She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
6459𓀴her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
6460𓀴so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
6461𓀴became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
6462𓀴certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
6463𓀴stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
6464𓀴waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
6465𓀴mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
6466𓀴spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
6467𓀴
6468𓀴At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
6469𓀴into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face
6470𓀴I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
6471𓀴sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down,
6472𓀴and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He
6473𓀴removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
6474𓀴he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein
6475𓀴Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
6476𓀴and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
6477𓀴
6478𓀴The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
6479𓀴
6480𓀴For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
6481𓀴at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--
6482𓀴
6483𓀴“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
6484𓀴me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
6485𓀴let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”
6486𓀴
6487𓀴I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
6488𓀴when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
6489𓀴he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
6490𓀴was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
6491𓀴Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
6492𓀴hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
6493𓀴perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
6494𓀴shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I
6495𓀴said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
6496𓀴and easiest for her.”
6497𓀴
6498𓀴When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
6499𓀴his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
6500𓀴everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s
6501𓀴hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
6502𓀴came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
6503𓀴softly:--
6504𓀴
6505𓀴“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to
6506𓀴kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not
6507𓀴yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
6508𓀴
6509𓀴So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
6510𓀴with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
6511𓀴gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
6512𓀴breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.
6513𓀴
6514𓀴And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
6515𓀴the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
6516𓀴gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
6517𓀴sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
6518𓀴were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
6519𓀴such as I had never heard from her lips:--
6520𓀴
6521𓀴“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent
6522𓀴eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
6523𓀴had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
6524𓀴the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
6525𓀴I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
6526𓀴across the room.
6527𓀴
6528𓀴“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And
6529𓀴he stood between them like a lion at bay.
6530𓀴
6531𓀴Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
6532𓀴or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
6533𓀴the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
6534𓀴
6535𓀴I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
6536𓀴of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
6537𓀴together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
6538𓀴
6539𓀴Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
6540𓀴putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown
6541𓀴one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a
6542𓀴faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,
6543𓀴guard him, and give me peace!”
6544𓀴
6545𓀴“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
6546𓀴hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
6547𓀴to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
6548𓀴forehead, and only once.”
6549𓀴
6550𓀴Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
6551𓀴
6552𓀴Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
6553𓀴Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
6554𓀴
6555𓀴And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
6556𓀴ceased.
6557𓀴
6558𓀴“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”
6559𓀴
6560𓀴I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
6561𓀴sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
6562𓀴nearly broke me down to see.
6563𓀴
6564𓀴I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
6565𓀴his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
6566𓀴Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
6567𓀴recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
6568𓀴deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
6569𓀴of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
6570𓀴might be.
6571𓀴
6572𓀴    “We thought her dying whilst she slept,
6573𓀴        And sleeping when she died.”
6574𓀴
6575𓀴I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--
6576𓀴
6577𓀴“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”
6578𓀴
6579𓀴He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--
6580𓀴
6581𓀴“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”
6582𓀴
6583𓀴When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--
6584𓀴
6585𓀴“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”
6586𓀴
6587𓀴

6590𓀴CHAPTER XIII
6591𓀴
6592𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.
6593𓀴
6594𓀴
6595𓀴The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
6596𓀴her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
6597𓀴formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
6598𓀴afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
6599𓀴Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
6600𓀴me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
6601𓀴from the death-chamber:--
6602𓀴
6603𓀴“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to
6604𓀴attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
6605𓀴establishment!”
6606𓀴
6607𓀴I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
6608𓀴the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
6609𓀴at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
6610𓀴father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
6611𓀴bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
6612𓀴ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s
6613𓀴papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
6614𓀴foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
6615𓀴so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--
6616𓀴
6617𓀴“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
6618𓀴this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
6619𓀴coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such
6620𓀴as this.”
6621𓀴
6622𓀴As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
6623𓀴in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
6624𓀴
6625𓀴“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
6626𓀴Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
6627𓀴here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself
6628𓀴search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
6629𓀴the hands of strangers.”
6630𓀴
6631𓀴I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
6632𓀴the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to
6633𓀴him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
6634𓀴regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
6635𓀴letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
6636𓀴saying:--
6637𓀴
6638𓀴“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
6639𓀴you.”
6640𓀴
6641𓀴“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:--
6642𓀴
6643𓀴“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
6644𓀴have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
6645𓀴diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
6646𓀴nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
6647𓀴his sanction, I shall use some.”
6648𓀴
6649𓀴When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--
6650𓀴
6651𓀴“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
6652𓀴and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
6653𓀴for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”
6654𓀴
6655𓀴Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
6656𓀴certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
6657𓀴_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
6658𓀴and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
6659𓀴winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
6660𓀴turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
6661𓀴wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s
6662𓀴loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
6663𓀴instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but
6664𓀴restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
6665𓀴that I was looking at a corpse.
6666𓀴
6667𓀴The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
6668𓀴there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I
6669𓀴return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
6670𓀴from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
6671𓀴placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
6672𓀴took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
6673𓀴placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
6674𓀴came away.
6675𓀴
6676𓀴I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
6677𓀴door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--
6678𓀴
6679𓀴“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
6680𓀴knives.”
6681𓀴
6682𓀴“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.
6683𓀴
6684𓀴“Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
6685𓀴now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
6686𓀴her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
6687𓀴no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
6688𓀴the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
6689𓀴you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
6690𓀴operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
6691𓀴Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,
6692𓀴and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined
6693𓀴ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
6694𓀴unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
6695𓀴all, so that none know, save we alone.”
6696𓀴
6697𓀴“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
6698𓀴without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing
6699𓀴to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
6700𓀴knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”
6701𓀴
6702𓀴For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
6703𓀴tenderness:--
6704𓀴
6705𓀴“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
6706𓀴because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
6707𓀴that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
6708𓀴shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
6709𓀴things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
6710𓀴did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but
6711𓀴man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
6712𓀴send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
6713𓀴horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was
6714𓀴dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
6715𓀴how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
6716𓀴weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
6717𓀴hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!
6718𓀴
6719𓀴“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
6720𓀴years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
6721𓀴strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
6722𓀴John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
6723𓀴not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no
6724𓀴trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
6725𓀴oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused a
6726𓀴moment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and
6727𓀴terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
6728𓀴a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”
6729𓀴
6730𓀴I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
6731𓀴and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
6732𓀴moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
6733𓀴her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy
6734𓀴lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
6735𓀴to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
6736𓀴putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
6737𓀴alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay

6741𓀴
6742𓀴I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
6743𓀴Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
6744𓀴said:--
6745𓀴
6746𓀴“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
6747𓀴
6748𓀴“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
6749𓀴impressed me.
6750𓀴
6751𓀴“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. See!” Here he
6752𓀴held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”
6753𓀴
6754𓀴“How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”
6755𓀴
6756𓀴“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
6757𓀴woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
6758𓀴come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
6759𓀴unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”
6760𓀴
6761𓀴He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
6762𓀴new puzzle to grapple with.
6763𓀴
6764𓀴The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
6765𓀴Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
6766𓀴and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
6767𓀴cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
6768𓀴some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
6769𓀴in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
6770𓀴entailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct
6771𓀴issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
6772𓀴real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
6773𓀴told us so much he went on:--
6774𓀴
6775𓀴“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
6776𓀴pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
6777𓀴penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
6778𓀴alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
6779𓀴collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
6780𓀴her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
6781𓀴right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should
6782𓀴have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
6783𓀴Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
6784𓀴disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
6785𓀴wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
6786𓀴into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
6787𓀴mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
6788𓀴will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been
6789𓀴treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,
6790𓀴though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
6791𓀴inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
6792𓀴rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure
6793𓀴you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”
6794𓀴
6795𓀴He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
6796𓀴he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an
6797𓀴object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.
6798𓀴
6799𓀴He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
6800𓀴see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
6801𓀴us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
6802𓀴criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock, so
6803𓀴a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
6804𓀴very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
6805𓀴true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
6806𓀴there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
6807𓀴once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
6808𓀴explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
6809𓀴less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_
6810𓀴quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
6811𓀴exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
6812𓀴the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
6813𓀴as we could avoid were saved.
6814𓀴
6815𓀴Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
6816𓀴manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
6817𓀴much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
6818𓀴attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
6819𓀴bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
6820𓀴was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
6821𓀴constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
6822𓀴bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I
6823𓀴felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
6824𓀴led me in, saying huskily:--
6825𓀴
6826𓀴“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
6827𓀴no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to
6828𓀴thank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”
6829𓀴
6830𓀴Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
6831𓀴laid his head on my breast, crying:--
6832𓀴
6833𓀴“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
6834𓀴all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”
6835𓀴
6836𓀴I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
6837𓀴expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
6838𓀴shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s
6839𓀴heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
6840𓀴softly to him:--
6841𓀴
6842𓀴“Come and look at her.”
6843𓀴
6844𓀴Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
6845𓀴God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
6846𓀴loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
6847𓀴fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
6848𓀴last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--
6849𓀴
6850𓀴“Jack, is she really dead?”
6851𓀴
6852𓀴I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt
6853𓀴that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
6854𓀴I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
6855𓀴softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
6856𓀴especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
6857𓀴suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
6858𓀴kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
6859𓀴long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
6860𓀴coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his
6861𓀴and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
6862𓀴fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.
6863𓀴
6864𓀴I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
6865𓀴good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men
6866𓀴to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he
6867𓀴came out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he
6868𓀴replied:--
6869𓀴
6870𓀴“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”
6871𓀴
6872𓀴We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
6873𓀴the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
6874𓀴when we had lit our cigars he said--
6875𓀴
6876𓀴“Lord----”; but Arthur interrupted him:--
6877𓀴
6878𓀴“No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
6879𓀴I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
6880𓀴recent.”
6881𓀴
6882𓀴The Professor answered very sweetly:--
6883𓀴
6884𓀴“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
6885𓀴‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
6886𓀴Arthur.”
6887𓀴
6888𓀴Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.
6889𓀴
6890𓀴“Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title of
6891𓀴a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
6892𓀴your goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I know
6893𓀴that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
6894𓀴rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--the
6895𓀴Professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
6896𓀴
6897𓀴He answered with a grave kindness:--
6898𓀴
6899𓀴“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
6900𓀴violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you
6901𓀴cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
6902𓀴more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
6903𓀴not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
6904𓀴shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
6905𓀴though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
6906𓀴first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
6907𓀴dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”
6908𓀴
6909𓀴“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways
6910𓀴trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
6911𓀴Jack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”
6912𓀴
6913𓀴The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
6914𓀴speak, and finally said:--
6915𓀴
6916𓀴“May I ask you something now?”
6917𓀴
6918𓀴“Certainly.”
6919𓀴
6920𓀴“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”
6921𓀴
6922𓀴“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”
6923𓀴
6924𓀴“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I
6925𓀴want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers and
6926𓀴letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
6927𓀴be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
6928𓀴before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
6929𓀴them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
6930𓀴them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
6931𓀴safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
6932𓀴to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
6933𓀴Lucy’s sake?”
6934𓀴
6935𓀴Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--
6936𓀴
6937𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
6938𓀴am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
6939𓀴with questions till the time comes.”
6940𓀴
6941𓀴The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--
6942𓀴
6943𓀴“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
6944𓀴all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of
6945𓀴all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
6946𓀴reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
6947𓀴duty, and all will be well!”
6948𓀴
6949𓀴I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to
6950𓀴bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
6951𓀴never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
6952𓀴the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
6953𓀴a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.

6956𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
6957𓀴
6958𓀴_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.
6959𓀴
6960𓀴It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
6961𓀴between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
6962𓀴no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
6963𓀴partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
6964𓀴Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
6965𓀴about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what
6966𓀴unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
6967𓀴again with an exercise anyhow....
6968𓀴
6969𓀴The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
6970𓀴and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
6971𓀴London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
6972𓀴President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
6973𓀴hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....
6974𓀴
6975𓀴We came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner.
6976𓀴Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so
6977𓀴we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
6978𓀴sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
6979𓀴of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
6980𓀴Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
6981𓀴before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on
6982𓀴for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
6983𓀴pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he
6984𓀴was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us--and we didn’t
6985𓀴care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
6986𓀴girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano’s,
6987𓀴when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
6988𓀴under his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I
6989𓀴fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
6990𓀴quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
6991𓀴
6992𓀴He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
6993𓀴half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
6994𓀴black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
6995𓀴girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
6996𓀴and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
6997𓀴hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
6998𓀴the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.
6999𓀴Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
7000𓀴feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
7001𓀴Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that
7002𓀴I knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it is?”
7003𓀴
7004𓀴“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed to
7005𓀴shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
7006𓀴to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--
7007𓀴
7008𓀴“It is the man himself!”
7009𓀴
7010𓀴The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
7011𓀴terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
7012𓀴support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
7013𓀴the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
7014𓀴off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
7015𓀴moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
7016𓀴hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--
7017𓀴
7018𓀴“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
7019𓀴so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He was
7020𓀴distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
7021𓀴subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
7022𓀴away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
7023𓀴further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
7024𓀴a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
7025𓀴After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed, and he
7026𓀴went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it
7027𓀴was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
7028𓀴minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--
7029𓀴
7030𓀴“Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
7031𓀴Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently forgotten
7032𓀴all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that
7033𓀴this episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing into
7034𓀴forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
7035𓀴not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
7036𓀴learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
7037𓀴must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
7038𓀴I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.

7042𓀴_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
7043𓀴soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
7044𓀴relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
7045𓀴may be:--
7046𓀴
7047𓀴“You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
7048𓀴that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.”
7049𓀴
7050𓀴Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
7051𓀴Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
7052𓀴lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
7053𓀴troubles.
7054𓀴
7055𓀴
7056𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
7057𓀴
7058𓀴_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
7059𓀴taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
7060𓀴in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as any
7061𓀴of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America
7062𓀴can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world
7063𓀴indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his
7064𓀴journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
7065𓀴to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
7066𓀴only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
7067𓀴he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
7068𓀴fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
7069𓀴iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting
7070𓀴some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
7071𓀴standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
7072𓀴the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s veins; I
7073𓀴could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
7074𓀴saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married
7075𓀴and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of
7076𓀴the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
7077𓀴away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
7078𓀴moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
7079𓀴hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
7080𓀴that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
7081𓀴terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
7082𓀴the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
7083𓀴till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
7084𓀴does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
7085𓀴circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
7086𓀴manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
7087𓀴grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
7088𓀴His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
7089𓀴forceful and mysterious. He said:--
7090𓀴
7091𓀴“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
7092𓀴though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
7093𓀴no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
7094𓀴just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
7095𓀴door and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a
7096𓀴king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
7097𓀴time of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve my
7098𓀴heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
7099𓀴I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
7100𓀴sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
7101𓀴grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
7102𓀴coffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood
7103𓀴from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
7104𓀴the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
7105𓀴hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
7106𓀴when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
7107𓀴father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend
7108𓀴John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
7109𓀴at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
7110𓀴‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of
7111𓀴the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
7112𓀴a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
7113𓀴troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
7114𓀴tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
7115𓀴tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
7116𓀴make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
7117𓀴he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
7118𓀴tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
7119𓀴like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
7120𓀴become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
7121𓀴sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
7122𓀴our labour, what it may be.”
7123𓀴
7124𓀴I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
7125𓀴did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
7126𓀴answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
7127𓀴tone:--
7128𓀴
7129𓀴“Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
7130𓀴flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
7131𓀴were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
7132𓀴churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
7133𓀴who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘Toll!
7134𓀴toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
7135𓀴garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
7136𓀴their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
7137𓀴for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”
7138𓀴
7139𓀴“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything to
7140𓀴laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
7141𓀴than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
7142𓀴Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”
7143𓀴
7144𓀴“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
7145𓀴made her truly his bride?”
7146𓀴
7147𓀴“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”
7148𓀴
7149𓀴“Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
7150𓀴what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
7151𓀴and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, though
7152𓀴no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
7153𓀴am bigamist.”
7154𓀴
7155𓀴“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did
7156𓀴not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
7157𓀴his hand on my arm, and said:--
7158𓀴
7159𓀴“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
7160𓀴when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
7161𓀴If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
7162𓀴if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
7163𓀴now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
7164𓀴he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would
7165𓀴perhaps pity me the most of all.”
7166𓀴
7167𓀴I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
7168𓀴
7169𓀴“Because I know!”
7170𓀴
7171𓀴And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
7172𓀴sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
7173𓀴kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
7174𓀴London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
7175𓀴and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
7176𓀴
7177𓀴So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
7178𓀴another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
7179𓀴different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
7180𓀴romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
7181𓀴life-work, I say sadly and without hope,
7182𓀴

7188𓀴                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.
7189𓀴
7190𓀴
7191𓀴The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
7192𓀴series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
7193𓀴was known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or
7194𓀴“The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two or
7195𓀴three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
7196𓀴home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
7197𓀴these cases the children were too young to give any properly
7198𓀴intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
7199𓀴is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late in
7200𓀴the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
7201𓀴children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
7202𓀴generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
7203𓀴gave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had asked him to
7204𓀴come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
7205𓀴occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
7206𓀴little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
7207𓀴correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
7208𓀴be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
7209𓀴might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
7210𓀴reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
7211𓀴principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular
7212𓀴rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says
7213𓀴that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
7214𓀴these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
7215𓀴themselves--to be.
7216𓀴
7217𓀴There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
7218𓀴the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
7219𓀴slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
7220𓀴made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
7221𓀴individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
7222𓀴a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
7223𓀴instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially
7224𓀴when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
7225𓀴which may be about.

7237𓀴
7238𓀴We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
7239𓀴night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the
7240𓀴Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
7241𓀴frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
7242𓀴throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
7243𓀴looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
7244𓀴story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”

7251𓀴MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL
7252𓀴
7253𓀴
7254𓀴_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
7255𓀴he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
7256𓀴things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
7257𓀴responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
7258𓀴and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
7259𓀴advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
7260𓀴him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
7261𓀴at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
7262𓀴and lock myself up in my room and read it....
7263𓀴
7264𓀴
7265𓀴_24 September_.--I hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
7266𓀴record of Jonathan’s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
7267𓀴whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
7268𓀴in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
7269𓀴terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
7270𓀴never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
7271𓀴we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
7272𓀴suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
7273𓀴train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
7274𓀴wedding-day he said: “Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to
7275𓀴the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” There seems to be
7276𓀴through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
7277𓀴coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
7278𓀴teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
7279𓀴not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
7280𓀴this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
7281𓀴eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
7282𓀴poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
7283𓀴him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
7284𓀴over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
7285𓀴questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.

7293𓀴
7294𓀴“Dear Madam,--
7295𓀴
7296𓀴“I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
7297𓀴sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra’s death. By the kindness of
7298𓀴Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am
7299𓀴deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find
7300𓀴some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
7301𓀴love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is
7302𓀴for others’ good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
7303𓀴and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it
7304𓀴be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
7305𓀴of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private
7306𓀴for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if
7307𓀴you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your
7308𓀴pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good
7309𓀴you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,
7310𓀴enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.

7322𓀴MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL.
7323𓀴
7324𓀴_25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
7325𓀴draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
7326𓀴it will throw some light upon Jonathan’s sad experience; and as he
7327𓀴attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
7328𓀴her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
7329𓀴sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
7330𓀴truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
7331𓀴imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
7332𓀴course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
7333𓀴awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
7334𓀴in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
7335𓀴of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
7336𓀴it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
7337𓀴understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
7338𓀴Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
7339𓀴a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
7340𓀴Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
7341𓀴late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.
7342𓀴
7343𓀴I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
7344𓀴does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
7345𓀴then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
7346𓀴and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
7347𓀴hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
7348𓀴occur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon
7349𓀴now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I am
7350𓀴so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
7351𓀴about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.

7354𓀴
7355𓀴_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it
7356𓀴all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
7357𓀴possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journal
7358𓀴first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
7359𓀴Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
7360𓀴not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
7361𓀴a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
7362𓀴consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
7363𓀴not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
7364𓀴which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
7365𓀴which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more
7366𓀴satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
7367𓀴good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr.
7368𓀴Seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
7369𓀴Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
7370𓀴noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
7371𓀴and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
7372𓀴end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s
7373𓀴friend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in such
7374𓀴work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
7375𓀴spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
7376𓀴interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.
7377𓀴
7378𓀴It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à
7379𓀴deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
7380𓀴announced “Dr. Van Helsing.”
7381𓀴
7382𓀴I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
7383𓀴strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
7384𓀴a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
7385𓀴of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
7386𓀴head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
7387𓀴clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
7388𓀴mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
7389𓀴nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
7390𓀴mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
7391𓀴straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
7392𓀴such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
7393𓀴but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
7394𓀴widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. He
7395𓀴said to me:--
7396𓀴
7397𓀴“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.
7398𓀴
7399𓀴“That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.
7400𓀴
7401𓀴“It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
7402𓀴child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”
7403𓀴
7404𓀴“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you were
7405𓀴a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took
7406𓀴it and said tenderly:--
7407𓀴
7408𓀴“Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
7409𓀴good, but I had yet to learn----” He finished his speech with a courtly
7410𓀴bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
7411𓀴once began:--
7412𓀴
7413𓀴“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
7414𓀴to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
7415𓀴with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look
7416𓀴surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
7417𓀴imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
7418𓀴things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
7419𓀴great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
7420𓀴kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”
7421𓀴
7422𓀴“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”
7423𓀴
7424𓀴“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
7425𓀴so with young ladies.”
7426𓀴
7427𓀴“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
7428𓀴if you like.”
7429𓀴
7430𓀴“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I
7431𓀴could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is
7432𓀴some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
7433𓀴mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
7434𓀴bow, and said:--
7435𓀴
7436𓀴“May I read it?”
7437𓀴
7438𓀴“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
7439𓀴an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.
7440𓀴
7441𓀴“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
7442𓀴man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
7443𓀴And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
7444𓀴Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over,
7445𓀴and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
7446𓀴workbasket and handed it to him.
7447𓀴
7448𓀴“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
7449𓀴it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
7450𓀴have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must
7451𓀴be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”
7452𓀴
7453𓀴He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may
7454𓀴I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”
7455𓀴
7456𓀴“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
7457𓀴can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in a
7458𓀴chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
7459𓀴whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
7460𓀴disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
7461𓀴the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
7462𓀴took me by both hands.
7463𓀴
7464𓀴“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
7465𓀴is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
7466𓀴much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
7467𓀴you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
7468𓀴clever woman. Madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever Abraham Van
7469𓀴Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
7470𓀴It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
7471𓀴friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
7472𓀴and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
7473𓀴you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
7474𓀴your husband will be blessed in you.”
7475𓀴
7476𓀴“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.”
7477𓀴
7478𓀴“Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
7479𓀴women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
7480𓀴him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
7481𓀴have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
7482𓀴line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
7483𓀴marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
7484𓀴all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
7485𓀴angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
7486𓀴angels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
7487𓀴you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
7488𓀴husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
7489𓀴is he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about
7490𓀴Jonathan, so I said:--
7491𓀴
7492𓀴“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’s
7493𓀴death.” He interrupted:--
7494𓀴
7495𓀴“Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I went
7496𓀴on:--
7497𓀴
7498𓀴“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
7499𓀴had a sort of shock.”
7500𓀴
7501𓀴“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
7502𓀴a shock was it?”
7503𓀴
7504𓀴“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
7505𓀴which led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to
7506𓀴overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
7507𓀴experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
7508𓀴has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
7509𓀴was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
7510𓀴him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
7511𓀴and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
7512𓀴hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--
7513𓀴
7514𓀴“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
7515𓀴had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
7516𓀴my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
7517𓀴nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
7518𓀴years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
7519𓀴full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I
7520𓀴am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
7521𓀴happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
7522𓀴the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
7523𓀴use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
7524𓀴study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
7525𓀴that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
7526𓀴one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
7527𓀴Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
7528𓀴where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
7529𓀴and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
7530𓀴speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
7531𓀴want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
7532𓀴will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
7533𓀴husband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
7534𓀴now; afterwards you shall tell me all.”
7535𓀴
7536𓀴After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--
7537𓀴
7538𓀴“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great
7539𓀴learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
7540𓀴Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go
7541𓀴on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
7542𓀴trusted him, so I said:--
7543𓀴
7544𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
7545𓀴laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
7546𓀴fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
7547𓀴have even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by
7548𓀴his manner as well as his words when he said:--
7549𓀴
7550𓀴“Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
7551𓀴I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
7552𓀴of any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
7553𓀴an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
7554𓀴it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
7555𓀴make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”
7556𓀴
7557𓀴“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
7558𓀴mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
7559𓀴but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
7560𓀴Jonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
7561𓀴happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
7562𓀴judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
7563𓀴me what you think.”
7564𓀴
7565𓀴“I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,
7566𓀴so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.”
7567𓀴
7568𓀴“Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
7569𓀴with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
7570𓀴will leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised at my
7571𓀴knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
7572𓀴up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
7573𓀴case he is in a hurry.
7574𓀴
7575𓀴So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
7576𓀴thinking--thinking I don’t know what.

7581𓀴
7582𓀴“_25 September, 6 o’clock._
7583𓀴
7584𓀴“Dear Madam Mina,--
7585𓀴
7586𓀴“I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without
7587𓀴doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my
7588𓀴life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
7589𓀴dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,
7590𓀴that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that
7591𓀴room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in
7592𓀴permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I
7593𓀴swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
7594𓀴ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for
7595𓀴I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more
7596𓀴than ever, and I must think.
7597𓀴
7598𓀴“Yours the most faithful,

7603𓀴_Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._
7604𓀴
7605𓀴“_25 September, 6:30 p. m._
7606𓀴
7607𓀴“My dear Dr. Van Helsing,--
7608𓀴
7609𓀴“A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight
7610𓀴off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
7611𓀴the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
7612𓀴in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a
7613𓀴wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
7614𓀴Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear
7615𓀴to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
7616𓀴to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? You can
7617𓀴get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
7618𓀴you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,
7619𓀴if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.
7620𓀴
7621𓀴“Believe me,
7622𓀴
7623𓀴“Your faithful and grateful friend,
7624𓀴
7625𓀴“MINA HARKER.”
7626𓀴
7627𓀴
7628𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
7629𓀴
7630𓀴_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
7631𓀴time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
7632𓀴when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her having
7633𓀴given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
7634𓀴about me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote down was
7635𓀴true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
7636𓀴reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
7637𓀴the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
7638𓀴of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
7639𓀴to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
7640𓀴is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
7641𓀴Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
7642𓀴shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....
7643𓀴
7644𓀴He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
7645𓀴was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
7646𓀴face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--
7647𓀴
7648𓀴“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It was
7649𓀴so funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly,
7650𓀴strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--
7651𓀴
7652𓀴“I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.”
7653𓀴
7654𓀴“And how?”
7655𓀴
7656𓀴“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
7657𓀴took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
7658𓀴evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
7659𓀴what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
7660𓀴the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
7661𓀴myself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even
7662𓀴yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” He
7663𓀴seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--
7664𓀴
7665𓀴“So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
7666𓀴so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
7667𓀴pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” I
7668𓀴would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
7669𓀴and stood silent.
7670𓀴
7671𓀴“She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
7672𓀴other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
7673𓀴light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
7674𓀴egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
7675𓀴selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
7676𓀴and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
7677𓀴knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
7678𓀴will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
7679𓀴lives.”
7680𓀴
7681𓀴We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
7682𓀴choky.
7683𓀴
7684𓀴“And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
7685𓀴task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
7686𓀴Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
7687𓀴may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”
7688𓀴
7689𓀴“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”
7690𓀴
7691𓀴“It does,” he said solemnly.
7692𓀴
7693𓀴“Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
7694𓀴will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
7695𓀴You can take them with you and read them in the train.”
7696𓀴
7697𓀴After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
7698𓀴said:--
7699𓀴
7700𓀴“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
7701𓀴too.”
7702𓀴
7703𓀴“We shall both come when you will,” I said.
7704𓀴
7705𓀴I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
7706𓀴night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
7707𓀴train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
7708𓀴catch something in one of them, “The Westminster Gazette”--I knew it by
7709𓀴the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
7710𓀴groaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!” I do not
7711𓀴think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
7712𓀴the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
7713𓀴the window and waved his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I shall
7714𓀴write so soon as ever I can.”
7715𓀴
7716𓀴
7717𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
7718𓀴
7719𓀴_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
7720𓀴since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
7721𓀴going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
7722𓀴think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
7723𓀴he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
7724𓀴just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
7725𓀴to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
7726𓀴gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
7727𓀴him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
7728𓀴good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
7729𓀴Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
7730𓀴them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
7731𓀴work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
7732𓀴fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
7733𓀴cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
7734𓀴end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
7735𓀴too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
7736𓀴went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
7737𓀴back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,
7738𓀴and thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.
7739𓀴
7740𓀴“What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded his
7741𓀴arms.
7742𓀴
7743𓀴I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
7744𓀴took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
7745𓀴away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
7746𓀴passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
7747𓀴idea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.
7748𓀴
7749𓀴“It is like poor Lucy’s.”
7750𓀴
7751𓀴“And what do you make of it?”
7752𓀴
7753𓀴“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
7754𓀴her has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:--
7755𓀴
7756𓀴“That is true indirectly, but not directly.”
7757𓀴
7758𓀴“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to take
7759𓀴his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
7760𓀴from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits--but
7761𓀴when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
7762𓀴despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.
7763𓀴
7764𓀴“Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
7765𓀴think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”
7766𓀴
7767𓀴“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
7768𓀴what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
7769𓀴events, but by me?”
7770𓀴
7771𓀴“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”
7772𓀴
7773𓀴“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over and
7774𓀴sat down beside me, and went on:--
7775𓀴
7776𓀴“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
7777𓀴but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
7778𓀴hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
7779𓀴you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
7780𓀴and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
7781𓀴there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s
7782𓀴eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
7783𓀴have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
7784𓀴explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
7785𓀴explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
7786𓀴which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
7787𓀴to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
7788𓀴believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
7789𓀴in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
7790𓀴hypnotism----”
7791𓀴
7792𓀴“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as he
7793𓀴went on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
7794𓀴understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
7795𓀴Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient
7796𓀴that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
7797𓀴simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
7798𓀴be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you
7799𓀴accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
7800𓀴friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
7801𓀴would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
7802𓀴electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
7803𓀴as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
7804𓀴Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and
7805𓀴sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor
7806𓀴veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
7807𓀴could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
7808𓀴you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
7809𓀴qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
7810𓀴why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
7811𓀴for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
7812𓀴till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
7813𓀴you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
7814𓀴come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
7815𓀴veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
7816𓀴on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
7817𓀴nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
7818𓀴it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
7819𓀴found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”
7820𓀴
7821𓀴“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me that
7822𓀴Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
7823𓀴in the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and went
7824𓀴on:--
7825𓀴
7826𓀴“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
7827𓀴men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
7828𓀴why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
7829𓀴Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
7830𓀴some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
7831𓀴women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the
7832𓀴fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
7833𓀴years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
7834𓀴the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
7835𓀴and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
7836𓀴corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
7837𓀴come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
7838𓀴fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here
7839𓀴I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
7840𓀴his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
7841𓀴imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
7842𓀴some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
7843𓀴he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
7844𓀴thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
7845𓀴wanted to follow him, so I said:--
7846𓀴
7847𓀴“Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
7848𓀴that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
7849𓀴my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
7850𓀴idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
7851𓀴from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
7852𓀴knowing where I am going.”
7853𓀴
7854𓀴“That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
7855𓀴this: I want you to believe.”
7856𓀴
7857𓀴“To believe what?”
7858𓀴
7859𓀴“To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
7860𓀴of an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to
7861𓀴believe things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man.
7862𓀴He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
7863𓀴truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
7864𓀴truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
7865𓀴him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
7866𓀴the universe.”
7867𓀴
7868𓀴“Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
7869𓀴receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
7870𓀴your lesson aright?”
7871𓀴
7872𓀴“Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
7873𓀴that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
7874𓀴understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’s
7875𓀴throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”
7876𓀴
7877𓀴“I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly:--
7878𓀴
7879𓀴“Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
7880𓀴far, far worse.”
7881𓀴
7882𓀴“In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?” I cried.
7883𓀴
7884𓀴He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
7885𓀴elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--
7886𓀴
7887𓀴“They were made by Miss Lucy!”

7892𓀴CHAPTER XV
7893𓀴
7894𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_.
7895𓀴
7896𓀴
7897𓀴For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
7898𓀴struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
7899𓀴him:--
7900𓀴
7901𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, and
7902𓀴somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” he
7903𓀴said. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
7904𓀴friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
7905𓀴you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
7906𓀴my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
7907𓀴now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
7908𓀴fearful death? Ah no!”
7909𓀴
7910𓀴“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:--
7911𓀴
7912𓀴“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
7913𓀴for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
7914𓀴expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
7915𓀴truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
7916𓀴believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
7917𓀴concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
7918𓀴it. Dare you come with me?”
7919𓀴
7920𓀴This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
7921𓀴excepted from the category, jealousy.
7922𓀴
7923𓀴    “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”
7924𓀴
7925𓀴He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--
7926𓀴
7927𓀴“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock
7928𓀴to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
7929𓀴at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
7930𓀴very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
7931𓀴I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
7932𓀴in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
7933𓀴say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
7934𓀴in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
7935𓀴will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
7936𓀴wish to learn. And then----”
7937𓀴
7938𓀴“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we
7939𓀴spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
7940𓀴the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
7941𓀴Arthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
7942𓀴ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
7943𓀴heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
7944𓀴passing....
7945𓀴
7946𓀴We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
7947𓀴altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
7948𓀴throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
7949𓀴similarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,
7950𓀴and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
7951𓀴attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
7952𓀴animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
7953𓀴that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
7954𓀴heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may
7955𓀴be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
7956𓀴sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
7957𓀴the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
7958𓀴there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
7959𓀴a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
7960𓀴week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
7961𓀴Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare
7962𓀴came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even
7963𓀴this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
7964𓀴might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
7965𓀴to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”
7966𓀴
7967𓀴“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child home
7968𓀴you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
7969𓀴to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
7970𓀴night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
7971𓀴not let it away for some days?”
7972𓀴
7973𓀴“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
7974𓀴healed.”
7975𓀴
7976𓀴Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
7977𓀴the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
7978𓀴was, he said:--
7979𓀴
7980𓀴“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
7981𓀴somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”
7982𓀴
7983𓀴We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of
7984𓀴bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we
7985𓀴started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
7986𓀴made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
7987𓀴radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
7988𓀴went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
7989𓀴locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
7990𓀴last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
7991𓀴police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
7992𓀴the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for
7993𓀴it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
7994𓀴the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
7995𓀴and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
7996𓀴precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
7997𓀴courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
7998𓀴companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
7999𓀴carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
8000𓀴one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
8001𓀴fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
8002𓀴proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
8003𓀴with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
8004𓀴days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
8005𓀴turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
8006𓀴beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
8007𓀴stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
8008𓀴brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
8009𓀴candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
8010𓀴imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
8011𓀴not the only thing which could pass away.
8012𓀴
8013𓀴Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
8014𓀴that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
8015𓀴dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
8016𓀴made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
8017𓀴out a turnscrew.
8018𓀴
8019𓀴“What are you going to do?” I asked.
8020𓀴
8021𓀴“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began
8022𓀴taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
8023𓀴casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
8024𓀴to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
8025𓀴stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
8026𓀴hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again
8027𓀴fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
8028𓀴through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
8029𓀴made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
8030𓀴the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
8031𓀴doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
8032𓀴such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
8033𓀴stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
8034𓀴the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
8035𓀴edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
8036𓀴coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
8037𓀴look.
8038𓀴
8039𓀴I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.
8040𓀴
8041𓀴It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
8042𓀴Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
8043𓀴and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friend
8044𓀴John?” he asked.
8045𓀴
8046𓀴I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
8047𓀴I answered him:--
8048𓀴
8049𓀴“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only
8050𓀴proves one thing.”
8051𓀴
8052𓀴“And what is that, friend John?”
8053𓀴
8054𓀴“That it is not there.”
8055𓀴
8056𓀴“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you--how
8057𓀴can you--account for it not being there?”
8058𓀴
8059𓀴“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s people
8060𓀴may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
8061𓀴the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah
8062𓀴well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”
8063𓀴
8064𓀴He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
8065𓀴them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
8066𓀴bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
8067𓀴locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had
8068𓀴better be assured.” I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
8069𓀴bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;
8070𓀴“there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
8071𓀴of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
8072𓀴told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
8073𓀴the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
8074𓀴figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
8075𓀴sight.
8076𓀴
8077𓀴It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
8078𓀴clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
8079𓀴unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
8080𓀴and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
8081𓀴observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
8082𓀴a dreary, miserable time.
8083𓀴
8084𓀴Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
8085𓀴streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
8086𓀴farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
8087𓀴Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
8088𓀴too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
8089𓀴stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
8090𓀴early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
8091𓀴juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
8092𓀴figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
8093𓀴by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
8094𓀴rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
8095𓀴coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
8096𓀴he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--
8097𓀴
8098𓀴“Are you satisfied now?”
8099𓀴
8100𓀴“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
8101𓀴
8102𓀴“Do you not see the child?”
8103𓀴
8104𓀴“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I
8105𓀴asked.
8106𓀴
8107𓀴“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
8108𓀴out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.
8109𓀴
8110𓀴When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
8111𓀴trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was
8112𓀴without a scratch or scar of any kind.
8113𓀴
8114𓀴“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.
8115𓀴
8116𓀴“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.
8117𓀴
8118𓀴We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
8119𓀴about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
8120𓀴give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
8121𓀴have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
8122𓀴So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
8123𓀴heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
8124𓀴it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
8125𓀴well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy
8126𓀴tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
8127𓀴he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
8128𓀴of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
8129𓀴cab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.
8130𓀴
8131𓀴I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’
8132𓀴sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
8133𓀴go with him on another expedition.

8136𓀴
8137𓀴_27 September._--It was two o’clock before we found a suitable
8138𓀴opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
8139𓀴and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
8140𓀴away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw
8141𓀴the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
8142𓀴morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
8143𓀴want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
8144𓀴reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
8145𓀴place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
8146𓀴incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
8147𓀴Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
8148𓀴nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
8149𓀴open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
8150𓀴eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
8151𓀴and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
8152𓀴no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
8153𓀴courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
8154𓀴last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
8155𓀴streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.
8156𓀴He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
8157𓀴of surprise and dismay shot through me.
8158𓀴
8159𓀴There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
8160𓀴funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
8161𓀴could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
8162𓀴before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.
8163𓀴
8164𓀴“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.
8165𓀴
8166𓀴“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
8167𓀴he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
8168𓀴dead lips and showed the white teeth.
8169𓀴
8170𓀴“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this
8171𓀴and this”--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
8172𓀴it--“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
8173𓀴John?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
8174𓀴accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
8175𓀴argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--
8176𓀴
8177𓀴“She may have been placed here since last night.”
8178𓀴
8179𓀴“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”
8180𓀴
8181𓀴“I do not know. Some one has done it.”
8182𓀴
8183𓀴“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
8184𓀴look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
8185𓀴seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
8186𓀴triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
8187𓀴the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
8188𓀴examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--
8189𓀴
8190𓀴“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
8191𓀴some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
8192𓀴when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
8193𓀴that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
8194𓀴he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
8195𓀴is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
8196𓀴the Un-Dead sleep at home”--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
8197𓀴his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”--“their face show what
8198𓀴they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
8199𓀴the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
8200𓀴it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood
8201𓀴cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s
8202𓀴theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
8203𓀴idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
8204𓀴my face, for he said almost joyously:--
8205𓀴
8206𓀴“Ah, you believe now?”
8207𓀴
8208𓀴I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
8209𓀴accept. How will you do this bloody work?”
8210𓀴
8211𓀴“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
8212𓀴drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so
8213𓀴mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
8214𓀴was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
8215𓀴shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
8216𓀴called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
8217𓀴or all objective?
8218𓀴
8219𓀴I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
8220𓀴if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
8221𓀴snap, and said:--
8222𓀴
8223𓀴“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
8224𓀴did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
8225𓀴to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
8226𓀴thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
8227𓀴simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
8228𓀴now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
8229𓀴want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
8230𓀴wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at
8231𓀴the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
8232𓀴to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
8233𓀴beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
8234𓀴of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
8235𓀴and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
8236𓀴Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
8237𓀴took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
8238𓀴because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
8239𓀴good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
8240𓀴this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
8241𓀴killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
8242𓀴have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
8243𓀴he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
8244𓀴sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
8245𓀴his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
8246𓀴will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
8247𓀴an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
8248𓀴I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
8249𓀴must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
8250𓀴must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
8251𓀴him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
8252𓀴made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
8253𓀴that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
8254𓀴churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
8255𓀴Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
8256𓀴and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
8257𓀴shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
8258𓀴there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.”
8259𓀴
8260𓀴So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
8261𓀴churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.

8268𓀴
8269𓀴“_27 September._
8270𓀴
8271𓀴“Friend John,--
8272𓀴
8273𓀴“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
8274𓀴that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
8275𓀴leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
8276𓀴Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
8277𓀴crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
8278𓀴and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
8279𓀴may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
8280𓀴desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
8281𓀴be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
8282𓀴and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
8283𓀴Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
8284𓀴she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
8285𓀴He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
8286𓀴along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, and
8287𓀴we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
8288𓀴strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
8289𓀴to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
8290𓀴I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
8291𓀴find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that
8292𓀴he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
8293𓀴hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
8294𓀴Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
8295𓀴
8296𓀴“Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
8297𓀴the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
8298𓀴great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
8299𓀴through it, so that the world may rest from him.
8300𓀴
8301𓀴“If it be so, farewell.

8307𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
8308𓀴
8309𓀴_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night’s sleep will do for
8310𓀴one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’s monstrous
8311𓀴ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
8312𓀴common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
8313𓀴mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
8314𓀴rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
8315𓀴the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
8316𓀴if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
8317𓀴some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
8318𓀴it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
8319𓀴Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
8320𓀴light on the mystery.

8323𓀴
8324𓀴_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,
8325𓀴Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all that he
8326𓀴wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
8327𓀴our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
8328𓀴all come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to be done
8329𓀴there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query was
8330𓀴directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
8331𓀴
8332𓀴“I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
8333𓀴around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
8334𓀴curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
8335𓀴more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
8336𓀴that I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”
8337𓀴
8338𓀴“Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.
8339𓀴
8340𓀴“Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of
8341𓀴you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
8342𓀴even get so far as to begin.”
8343𓀴
8344𓀴It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
8345𓀴mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
8346𓀴with intense gravity:--
8347𓀴
8348𓀴“I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
8349𓀴know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
8350𓀴know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
8351𓀴in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
8352𓀴time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
8353𓀴be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”
8354𓀴
8355𓀴“That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the Professor.
8356𓀴I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and that’s good
8357𓀴enough for me.”
8358𓀴
8359𓀴“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself the
8360𓀴honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
8361𓀴to me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.
8362𓀴
8363𓀴Then Arthur spoke out:--
8364𓀴
8365𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’ as they
8366𓀴say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
8367𓀴or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
8368𓀴If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
8369𓀴these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
8370𓀴cannot understand what you are driving at.”
8371𓀴
8372𓀴“I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you is
8373𓀴that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
8374𓀴consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
8375𓀴reservations.”
8376𓀴
8377𓀴“Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the
8378𓀴_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?”
8379𓀴
8380𓀴“I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
8381𓀴Kingstead.”
8382𓀴
8383𓀴Arthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--
8384𓀴
8385𓀴“Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: “And
8386𓀴when there?”
8387𓀴
8388𓀴“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.
8389𓀴
8390𓀴“Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
8391𓀴I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see that
8392𓀴he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
8393𓀴silence until he asked again:--
8394𓀴
8395𓀴“And when in the tomb?”
8396𓀴
8397𓀴“To open the coffin.”
8398𓀴
8399𓀴“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to be
8400𓀴patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
8401𓀴of the grave--of one who----” He fairly choked with indignation. The
8402𓀴Professor looked pityingly at him.
8403𓀴
8404𓀴“If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God knows I
8405𓀴would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
8406𓀴for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”
8407𓀴
8408𓀴Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--
8409𓀴
8410𓀴“Take care, sir, take care!”
8411𓀴
8412𓀴“Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van Helsing.
8413𓀴“And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
8414𓀴on?”
8415𓀴
8416𓀴“That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris.
8417𓀴
8418𓀴After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--
8419𓀴
8420𓀴“Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
8421𓀴her. But if she be not dead----”
8422𓀴
8423𓀴Arthur jumped to his feet.
8424𓀴
8425𓀴“Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
8426𓀴she been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
8427𓀴soften.
8428𓀴
8429𓀴“I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
8430𓀴further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”
8431𓀴
8432𓀴“Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
8433𓀴is it?”
8434𓀴
8435𓀴“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
8436𓀴may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
8437𓀴I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”
8438𓀴
8439𓀴“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not for
8440𓀴the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
8441𓀴Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
8442𓀴torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
8443𓀴cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or
8444𓀴am I mad to listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such a
8445𓀴desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
8446𓀴duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
8447𓀴it!”
8448𓀴
8449𓀴Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
8450𓀴said, gravely and sternly:--
8451𓀴
8452𓀴“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
8453𓀴to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
8454𓀴now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
8455𓀴later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
8456𓀴fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it
8457𓀴may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall
8458𓀴hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
8459𓀴you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
8460𓀴pity:--
8461𓀴
8462𓀴“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
8463𓀴acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
8464𓀴my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
8465𓀴the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
8466𓀴you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
8467𓀴to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
8468𓀴much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
8469𓀴to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
8470𓀴then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I
8471𓀴am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you
8472𓀴gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
8473𓀴lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
8474𓀴and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
8475𓀴even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He
8476𓀴said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
8477𓀴by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:--
8478𓀴
8479𓀴“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
8480𓀴shall go with you and wait.”

8485𓀴CHAPTER XVI
8486𓀴
8487𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_
8488𓀴
8489𓀴
8490𓀴It was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
8491𓀴churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
8492𓀴of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
8493𓀴the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
8494𓀴in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
8495𓀴well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
8496𓀴sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
8497𓀴that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
8498𓀴to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
8499𓀴hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
8500𓀴entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
8501𓀴He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
8502𓀴forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--
8503𓀴
8504𓀴“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
8505𓀴coffin?”
8506𓀴
8507𓀴“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:--
8508𓀴
8509𓀴“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” He
8510𓀴took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
8511𓀴looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
8512𓀴forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
8513𓀴at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
8514𓀴the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
8515𓀴again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
8516𓀴Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
8517𓀴recoiled.
8518𓀴
8519𓀴The coffin was empty!
8520𓀴
8521𓀴For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
8522𓀴Quincey Morris:--
8523𓀴
8524𓀴“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t ask
8525𓀴such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a
8526𓀴doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
8527𓀴Is this your doing?”
8528𓀴
8529𓀴“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
8530𓀴touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
8531𓀴I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
8532𓀴was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
8533𓀴saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
8534𓀴day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”
8535𓀴
8536𓀴“Yes.”
8537𓀴
8538𓀴“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
8539𓀴and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
8540𓀴here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
8541𓀴all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
8542𓀴that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
8543𓀴which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
8544𓀴night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my
8545𓀴garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
8546𓀴bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
8547𓀴outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
8548𓀴So”--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”
8549𓀴He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
8550𓀴door behind him.
8551𓀴
8552𓀴Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
8553𓀴that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
8554𓀴gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
8555𓀴passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was
8556𓀴to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
8557𓀴humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
8558𓀴hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
8559𓀴in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
8560𓀴could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
8561𓀴mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
8562𓀴throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey
8563𓀴Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
8564𓀴accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
8565𓀴stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
8566𓀴tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
8567𓀴definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
8568𓀴thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
8569𓀴napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
8570𓀴dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
8571𓀴mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
8572𓀴strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
8573𓀴setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
8574𓀴asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
8575𓀴also, as they too were curious. He answered:--
8576𓀴
8577𓀴“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”
8578𓀴
8579𓀴“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.
8580𓀴“Great Scott! Is this a game?”
8581𓀴
8582𓀴“It is.”
8583𓀴
8584𓀴“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by
8585𓀴Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--
8586𓀴
8587𓀴“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an
8588𓀴answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
8589𓀴that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a
8590𓀴purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
8591𓀴impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
8592𓀴assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
8593𓀴one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
8594𓀴been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
8595𓀴who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
8596𓀴within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
8597𓀴yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
8598𓀴or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
8599𓀴mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
8600𓀴woeful presage through the night.
8601𓀴
8602𓀴There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
8603𓀴Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
8604𓀴we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
8605𓀴dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
8606𓀴moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
8607𓀴prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
8608𓀴We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
8609𓀴fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
8610𓀴child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
8611𓀴were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us as
8612𓀴he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
8613𓀴white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
8614𓀴clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
8615𓀴and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
8616𓀴Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
8617𓀴turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
8618𓀴wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
8619𓀴all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
8620𓀴tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
8621𓀴concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips
8622𓀴were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
8623𓀴chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.
8624𓀴
8625𓀴We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
8626𓀴Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
8627𓀴not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.
8628𓀴
8629𓀴When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
8630𓀴shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
8631𓀴when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form
8632𓀴and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
8633𓀴the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
8634𓀴passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
8635𓀴done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
8636𓀴light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
8637𓀴how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
8638𓀴the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
8639𓀴clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
8640𓀴over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
8641𓀴was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
8642𓀴she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
8643𓀴back and hid his face in his hands.
8644𓀴
8645𓀴She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
8646𓀴said:--
8647𓀴
8648𓀴“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
8649𓀴hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!”
8650𓀴
8651𓀴There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
8652𓀴tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
8653𓀴who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
8654𓀴a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
8655𓀴was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
8656𓀴them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
8657𓀴suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
8658𓀴the tomb.
8659𓀴
8660𓀴When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
8661𓀴arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
8662𓀴shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
8663𓀴quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
8664𓀴malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
8665𓀴mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
8666𓀴out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
8667𓀴the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,
8668𓀴blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
8669𓀴the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could
8670𓀴kill--we saw it at that moment.
8671𓀴
8672𓀴And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
8673𓀴between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
8674𓀴entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--
8675𓀴
8676𓀴“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”
8677𓀴
8678𓀴Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
8679𓀴answered:--
8680𓀴
8681𓀴“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
8682𓀴this ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
8683𓀴simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
8684𓀴click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
8685𓀴to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
8686𓀴emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
8687𓀴amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
8688𓀴body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
8689𓀴where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
8690𓀴relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
8691𓀴to the edges of the door.
8692𓀴
8693𓀴When this was done, he lifted the child and said:
8694𓀴
8695𓀴“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
8696𓀴funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
8697𓀴friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
8698𓀴the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
8699𓀴to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
8700𓀴night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
8701𓀴him, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur,
8702𓀴he said:--
8703𓀴
8704𓀴“My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
8705𓀴back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
8706𓀴waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
8707𓀴passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
8708𓀴overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”
8709𓀴
8710𓀴Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
8711𓀴on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
8712𓀴slept with more or less reality of sleep.
8713𓀴
8714𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
8715𓀴
8716𓀴_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o’clock we three--Arthur,
8717𓀴Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to
8718𓀴notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
8719𓀴course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
8720𓀴us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
8721𓀴strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
8722𓀴gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
8723𓀴that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
8724𓀴ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
8725𓀴long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
8726𓀴fair weight.
8727𓀴
8728𓀴When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
8729𓀴the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
8730𓀴Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
8731𓀴behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
8732𓀴two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
8733𓀴ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
8734𓀴by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked--Arthur
8735𓀴trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
8736𓀴death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
8737𓀴loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her
8738𓀴soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently
8739𓀴he said to Van Helsing:--
8740𓀴
8741𓀴“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”
8742𓀴
8743𓀴“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
8744𓀴as she was, and is.”
8745𓀴
8746𓀴She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
8747𓀴the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
8748𓀴see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
8749𓀴devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
8750𓀴methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
8751𓀴placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
8752𓀴plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
8753𓀴a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
8754𓀴flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
8755𓀴round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
8756𓀴three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
8757𓀴was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
8758𓀴as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
8759𓀴me, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
8760𓀴bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
8761𓀴to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
8762𓀴courage, and remained silent and quiet.
8763𓀴
8764𓀴When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--
8765𓀴
8766𓀴“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
8767𓀴experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
8768𓀴of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
8769𓀴curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
8770𓀴adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
8771𓀴die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey
8772𓀴on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
8773𓀴ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
8774𓀴that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
8775𓀴when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
8776𓀴have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
8777𓀴all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.
8778𓀴The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
8779𓀴children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
8780𓀴she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
8781𓀴power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
8782𓀴so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
8783𓀴wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
8784𓀴unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
8785𓀴this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
8786𓀴lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
8787𓀴night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
8788𓀴shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
8789𓀴be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
8790𓀴To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
8791𓀴right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
8792𓀴night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
8793𓀴was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
8794𓀴herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there be
8795𓀴such a one amongst us?”
8796𓀴
8797𓀴We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
8798𓀴kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
8799𓀴Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
8800𓀴said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
8801𓀴snow:--
8802𓀴
8803𓀴“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
8804𓀴what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his
8805𓀴shoulder, and said:--
8806𓀴
8807𓀴“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be
8808𓀴driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
8809𓀴that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
8810𓀴than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
8811𓀴you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
8812𓀴think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
8813𓀴you all the time.”
8814𓀴
8815𓀴“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”
8816𓀴
8817𓀴“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
8818𓀴heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
8819𓀴the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
8820𓀴follow--strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
8821𓀴we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”
8822𓀴
8823𓀴Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
8824𓀴action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
8825𓀴his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
8826𓀴could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
8827𓀴see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.
8828𓀴
8829𓀴The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
8830𓀴came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
8831𓀴in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
8832𓀴lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
8833𓀴never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
8834𓀴rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
8835𓀴the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
8836𓀴face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
8837𓀴gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
8838𓀴vault.
8839𓀴
8840𓀴And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
8841𓀴teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
8842𓀴terrible task was over.
8843𓀴
8844𓀴The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
8845𓀴we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
8846𓀴and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
8847𓀴on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
8848𓀴considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
8849𓀴minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
8850𓀴coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
8851𓀴to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
8852𓀴been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
8853𓀴strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
8854𓀴horror that lay upon it.
8855𓀴
8856𓀴There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
8857𓀴and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
8858𓀴privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
8859𓀴her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
8860𓀴there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
8861𓀴pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
8862𓀴to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
8863𓀴sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
8864𓀴symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
8865𓀴
8866𓀴Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to
8867𓀴him:--
8868𓀴
8869𓀴“And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”
8870𓀴
8871𓀴The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand
8872𓀴in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--
8873𓀴
8874𓀴“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
8875𓀴and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and laying
8876𓀴his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
8877𓀴unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--
8878𓀴
8879𓀴“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
8880𓀴she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
8881𓀴devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
8882𓀴the devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”
8883𓀴
8884𓀴Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
8885𓀴tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
8886𓀴of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
8887𓀴garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
8888𓀴and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
8889𓀴the door he gave the key to Arthur.
8890𓀴
8891𓀴Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
8892𓀴seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
8893𓀴gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
8894𓀴on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.
8895𓀴
8896𓀴Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--
8897𓀴
8898𓀴“Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
8899𓀴to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
8900𓀴of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
8901𓀴follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
8902𓀴it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
8903𓀴of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
8904𓀴we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”
8905𓀴
8906𓀴Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
8907𓀴Professor as we moved off:--
8908𓀴
8909𓀴“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
8910𓀴the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
8911𓀴know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
8912𓀴unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
8913𓀴about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
8914𓀴return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
8915𓀴shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
8916𓀴Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
8917𓀴terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
8918𓀴must not draw back.”

8924𓀴
8925𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY--_continued_
8926𓀴
8927𓀴
8928𓀴When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
8929𓀴waiting for him:--
8930𓀴
8931𓀴     “Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA
8932𓀴     HARKER.”
8933𓀴
8934𓀴The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,
8935𓀴“pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
8936𓀴house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
8937𓀴route_, so that she may be prepared.”
8938𓀴
8939𓀴When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
8940𓀴a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
8941𓀴copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” he
8942𓀴said, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
8943𓀴all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
8944𓀴them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
8945𓀴faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What
8946𓀴is here told,” he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
8947𓀴papers as he spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
8948𓀴many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
8949𓀴earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
8950𓀴any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
8951𓀴kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
8952𓀴shall go through all these together when we meet.” He then made ready
8953𓀴for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
8954𓀴took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
8955𓀴the train came in.
8956𓀴
8957𓀴The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
8958𓀴platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
8959𓀴guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
8960𓀴after a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”
8961𓀴
8962𓀴“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held out
8963𓀴her hand.
8964𓀴
8965𓀴“I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----” She stopped
8966𓀴suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.
8967𓀴
8968𓀴The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
8969𓀴was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
8970𓀴typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
8971𓀴sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
8972𓀴prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.
8973𓀴
8974𓀴In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
8975𓀴lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
8976𓀴when we entered.
8977𓀴
8978𓀴She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
8979𓀴she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
8980𓀴diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
8981𓀴the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
8982𓀴me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
8983𓀴opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
8984𓀴what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
8985𓀴she is!

8988𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
8989𓀴
8990𓀴_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’s
8991𓀴study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
8992𓀴with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
8993𓀴the door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.
8994𓀴
8995𓀴To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
8996𓀴and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
8997𓀴description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
8998𓀴interested.
8999𓀴
9000𓀴“I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the door
9001𓀴as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”
9002𓀴
9003𓀴“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”
9004𓀴
9005𓀴“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.
9006𓀴
9007𓀴“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand on
9008𓀴the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--
9009𓀴
9010𓀴“Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”
9011𓀴
9012𓀴“Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
9013𓀴for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.
9014𓀴
9015𓀴“The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and as
9016𓀴it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
9017𓀴is, I mean----” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
9018𓀴embarrassment:--
9019𓀴
9020𓀴“You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
9021𓀴for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
9022𓀴dear to me.”
9023𓀴
9024𓀴To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--
9025𓀴
9026𓀴“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”
9027𓀴
9028𓀴“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
9029𓀴Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
9030𓀴At length he stammered out:--
9031𓀴
9032𓀴“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
9033𓀴diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
9034𓀴with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté
9035𓀴of a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I could
9036𓀴not but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that time!” he
9037𓀴said. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
9038𓀴past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
9039𓀴part of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind was
9040𓀴made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
9041𓀴something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
9042𓀴I said boldly:--
9043𓀴
9044𓀴“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
9045𓀴typewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--
9046𓀴
9047𓀴“No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terrible
9048𓀴story!”
9049𓀴
9050𓀴Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
9051𓀴and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
9052𓀴some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
9053𓀴the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
9054𓀴followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.
9055𓀴
9056𓀴“You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers--my own
9057𓀴diary and my husband’s also, which I have typed--you will know me
9058𓀴better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
9059𓀴this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not
9060𓀴expect you to trust me so far.”
9061𓀴
9062𓀴He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
9063𓀴him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
9064𓀴order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
9065𓀴said:--
9066𓀴
9067𓀴“You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
9068𓀴But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
9069𓀴ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
9070𓀴the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the
9071𓀴first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
9072𓀴you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
9073𓀴meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
9074𓀴able to understand certain things.” He carried the phonograph himself up
9075𓀴to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
9076𓀴pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
9077𓀴episode of which I know one side already....

9079𓀴
9080𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
9081𓀴
9082𓀴_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
9083𓀴Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
9084𓀴thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
9085𓀴dinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” and
9086𓀴I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary, when
9087𓀴she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
9088𓀴flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
9089𓀴cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
9090𓀴now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
9091𓀴straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--
9092𓀴
9093𓀴“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”
9094𓀴
9095𓀴“Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touched
9096𓀴than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
9097𓀴cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
9098𓀴It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
9099𓀴spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
9100𓀴words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
9101𓀴I did.”
9102𓀴
9103𓀴“No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She
9104𓀴laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--
9105𓀴
9106𓀴“Ah, but they must!”
9107𓀴
9108𓀴“Must! But why?” I asked.
9109𓀴
9110𓀴“Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’s
9111𓀴death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
9112𓀴before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
9113𓀴the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
9114𓀴cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
9115𓀴but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
9116𓀴mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
9117𓀴point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
9118𓀴how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
9119𓀴out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
9120𓀴Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
9121𓀴will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
9122𓀴working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
9123𓀴if some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and at
9124𓀴the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
9125𓀴that I gave in at once to her wishes. “You shall,” I said, “do as you
9126𓀴like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
9127𓀴things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
9128𓀴poor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
9129𓀴dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
9130𓀴there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
9131𓀴we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
9132𓀴the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
9133𓀴which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
9134𓀴present.”

9137𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
9138𓀴
9139𓀴_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
9140𓀴brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
9141𓀴placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
9142𓀴could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
9143𓀴I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
9144𓀴back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
9145𓀴put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
9146𓀴
9147𓀴When the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and--and all that followed, was
9148𓀴done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
9149𓀴fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
9150𓀴horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
9151𓀴cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
9152𓀴me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
9153𓀴the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
9154𓀴was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
9155𓀴making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
9156𓀴had not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not have
9157𓀴believed. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of my
9158𓀴difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
9159𓀴typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--
9160𓀴
9161𓀴“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
9162𓀴when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
9163𓀴he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
9164𓀴and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
9165𓀴put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
9166𓀴Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
9167𓀴when they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
9168𓀴began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
9169𓀴manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
9170𓀴all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
9171𓀴his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
9172𓀴came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
9173𓀴whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
9174𓀴good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
9175𓀴remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’s
9176𓀴perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
9177𓀴Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
9178𓀴files of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and took
9179𓀴them to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The Whitby
9180𓀴Gazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
9181𓀴terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
9182𓀴through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
9183𓀴light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.

9187𓀴
9188𓀴_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got his
9189𓀴wife’s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
9190𓀴judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and
9191𓀴judging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man
9192𓀴of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
9193𓀴remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
9194𓀴prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
9195𓀴business-like gentleman who came here to-day.

9198𓀴
9199𓀴_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
9200𓀴and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
9201𓀴are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
9202𓀴chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
9203𓀴the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
9204𓀴carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife’s
9205𓀴typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
9206𓀴is....
9207𓀴
9208𓀴     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
9209𓀴     the Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
9210𓀴     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
9211𓀴     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
9212𓀴     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
9213𓀴     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
9214𓀴     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be
9215𓀴     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
9216𓀴     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
9217𓀴     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
9218𓀴     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
9219𓀴     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
9220𓀴     found the dates otherwise....
9221𓀴
9222𓀴     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
9223𓀴     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
9224𓀴     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
9225𓀴     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
9226𓀴     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
9227𓀴     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
9228𓀴     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
9229𓀴     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
9230𓀴     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
9231𓀴     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
9232𓀴     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
9233𓀴     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
9234𓀴     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph?
9235𓀴     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
9236𓀴     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” This
9237𓀴     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
9238𓀴     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
9239𓀴     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
9240𓀴     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
9241𓀴     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
9242𓀴     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.

9245𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
9246𓀴
9247𓀴_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington’s
9248𓀴courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
9249𓀴thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
9250𓀴inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
9251𓀴of the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
9252𓀴with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
9253𓀴brought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must
9254𓀴stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
9255𓀴give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
9256𓀴knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
9257𓀴ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
9258𓀴It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
9259𓀴seen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
9260𓀴Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
9261𓀴with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
9262𓀴might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
9263𓀴out. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the absolute
9264𓀴accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
9265𓀴logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
9266𓀴“Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”
9267𓀴Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
9268𓀴these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
9269𓀴give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
9270𓀴officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
9271𓀴strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
9272𓀴tradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty cases
9273𓀴of common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
9274𓀴communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
9275𓀴tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
9276𓀴the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry
9277𓀴work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any
9278𓀴gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of
9279𓀴appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
9280𓀴that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
9281𓀴elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
9282𓀴before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
9283𓀴reproach.
9284𓀴

9286𓀴
9287𓀴_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
9288𓀴his old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when I
9289𓀴arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
9290𓀴the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
9291𓀴officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
9292𓀴invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
9293𓀴limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
9294𓀴compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.
9295𓀴
9296𓀴From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I met
9297𓀴with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
9298𓀴day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross
9299𓀴office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
9300𓀴were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
9301𓀴also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
9302𓀴delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
9303𓀴exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the
9304𓀴written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
9305𓀴almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
9306𓀴thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
9307𓀴through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
9308𓀴later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--
9309𓀴
9310𓀴“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
9311𓀴ain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
9312𓀴the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;
9313𓀴an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole
9314𓀴Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me
9315𓀴and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, I
9316𓀴wouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”
9317𓀴
9318𓀴Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
9319𓀴I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.
9320𓀴
9321𓀴Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
9322𓀴Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
9323𓀴chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
9324𓀴since been removed--as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.
9325𓀴
9326𓀴I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
9327𓀴Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
9328𓀴deal.

9338𓀴_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
9339𓀴It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
9340𓀴that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
9341𓀴detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
9342𓀴face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
9343𓀴however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
9344𓀴so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
9345𓀴Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
9346𓀴strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
9347𓀴hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I
9348𓀴feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
9349𓀴thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
9350𓀴human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s
9351𓀴death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
9352𓀴one’s heart.

9355𓀴
9356𓀴_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
9357𓀴expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
9358𓀴him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
9359𓀴brought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Of
9360𓀴course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
9361𓀴Helsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris
9362𓀴expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
9363𓀴about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
9364𓀴say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
9365𓀴had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
9366𓀴came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
9367𓀴them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary that
9368𓀴they had been at Lucy’s death--her real death--and that I need not fear
9369𓀴to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
9370𓀴could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
9371𓀴and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
9372𓀴I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
9373𓀴his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--
9374𓀴
9375𓀴“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”
9376𓀴
9377𓀴I nodded, and he went on:--
9378𓀴
9379𓀴“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
9380𓀴kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
9381𓀴I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
9382𓀴had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
9383𓀴to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--”
9384𓀴Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
9385𓀴the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
9386𓀴a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
9387𓀴room. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes a man
9388𓀴free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
9389𓀴emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
9390𓀴Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
9391𓀴gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
9392𓀴hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
9393𓀴afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
9394𓀴_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
9395𓀴could see that his heart was breaking:--
9396𓀴
9397𓀴“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
9398𓀴her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
9399𓀴me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
9400𓀴had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
9401𓀴help in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little service--for
9402𓀴Lucy’s sake?”
9403𓀴
9404𓀴In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
9405𓀴to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
9406𓀴vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
9407𓀴his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
9408𓀴down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
9409𓀴pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
9410𓀴head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
9411𓀴emotion.
9412𓀴
9413𓀴We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
9414𓀴smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
9415𓀴sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
9416𓀴that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
9417𓀴were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.
9418𓀴
9419𓀴After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
9420𓀴apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
9421𓀴days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
9422𓀴unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
9423𓀴sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
9424𓀴whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
9425𓀴surrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said,
9426𓀴as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet--and none other can
9427𓀴ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
9428𓀴know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
9429𓀴now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
9430𓀴like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy’s sake?”
9431𓀴
9432𓀴“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your
9433𓀴own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth
9434𓀴the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
9435𓀴to you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not call
9436𓀴in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
9437𓀴sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
9438𓀴will let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
9439𓀴I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--
9440𓀴
9441𓀴“I promise.”
9442𓀴
9443𓀴As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
9444𓀴He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticing
9445𓀴my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
9446𓀴old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
9447𓀴trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”
9448𓀴
9449𓀴He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
9450𓀴manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
9451𓀴how much I knew; so I said to him:--
9452𓀴
9453𓀴“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
9454𓀴be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
9455𓀴will know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and
9456𓀴stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
9457𓀴but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
9458𓀴bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
9459𓀴momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--
9460𓀴
9461𓀴“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
9462𓀴as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.
9463𓀴
9464𓀴“Little girl!”--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
9465𓀴proved himself a friend!

9472𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
9473𓀴
9474𓀴
9475𓀴_30 September._--I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming
9476𓀴and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
9477𓀴of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
9478𓀴had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
9479𓀴carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
9480𓀴us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
9481𓀴have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
9482𓀴finished, Mrs. Harker said:--
9483𓀴
9484𓀴“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
9485𓀴Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
9486𓀴interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
9487𓀴could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
9488𓀴I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
9489𓀴lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”
9490𓀴
9491𓀴“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I
9492𓀴answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but
9493𓀴just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was
9494𓀴peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
9495𓀴before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
9496𓀴jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
9497𓀴task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the
9498𓀴edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
9499𓀴he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
9500𓀴have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
9501𓀴before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
9502𓀴could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
9503𓀴came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
9504𓀴the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
9505𓀴people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
9506𓀴held out her hand.
9507𓀴
9508𓀴“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.
9509𓀴Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
9510𓀴over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
9511𓀴of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
9512𓀴said:--
9513𓀴
9514𓀴“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,
9515𓀴you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
9516𓀴
9517𓀴“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
9518𓀴saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”
9519𓀴
9520𓀴“Then what are you doing here?”
9521𓀴
9522𓀴“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”
9523𓀴
9524𓀴“Then don’t stay.”
9525𓀴
9526𓀴“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be
9527𓀴pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--
9528𓀴
9529𓀴“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply
9530𓀴contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
9531𓀴Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
9532𓀴
9533𓀴“What an asinine question!”
9534𓀴
9535𓀴“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once
9536𓀴championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
9537𓀴he had shown contempt to me:--
9538𓀴
9539𓀴“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
9540𓀴loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
9541𓀴interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
9542𓀴household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
9543𓀴them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
9544𓀴effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
9545𓀴cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
9546𓀴lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” I
9547𓀴positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
9548𓀴lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
9549𓀴with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
9550𓀴gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched
9551𓀴some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
9552𓀴way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
9553𓀴power.
9554𓀴
9555𓀴We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
9556𓀴quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
9557𓀴began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
9558𓀴he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
9559𓀴completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
9560𓀴certain things.
9561𓀴
9562𓀴“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
9563𓀴it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
9564𓀴put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
9565𓀴perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
9566𓀴matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
9567𓀴life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
9568𓀴take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
9569𓀴tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
9570𓀴the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
9571𓀴blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is
9572𓀴the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
9573𓀴vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true,
9574𓀴doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
9575𓀴either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
9576𓀴his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
9577𓀴saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
9578𓀴Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
9579𓀴pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
9580𓀴under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he
9581𓀴replied:--
9582𓀴
9583𓀴“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
9584𓀴May He bless and keep you!”
9585𓀴
9586𓀴When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
9587𓀴me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
9588𓀴ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
9589𓀴many a long day.
9590𓀴
9591𓀴Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
9592𓀴boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--
9593𓀴
9594𓀴“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
9595𓀴here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
9596𓀴much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
9597𓀴Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”
9598𓀴
9599𓀴As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
9600𓀴diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; at
9601𓀴which the Professor interrupted me:--
9602𓀴
9603𓀴“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain--a brain that a man
9604𓀴should have were he much gifted--and a woman’s heart. The good God
9605𓀴fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
9606𓀴combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
9607𓀴to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
9608𓀴affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
9609𓀴determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
9610𓀴no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
9611𓀴in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
9612𓀴waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
9613𓀴she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
9614𓀴think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
9615𓀴must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
9616𓀴we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
9617𓀴had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
9618𓀴the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
9619𓀴to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we
9620𓀴might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk
9621𓀴that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think
9622𓀴of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that
9623𓀴lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
9624𓀴dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--
9625𓀴
9626𓀴“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
9627𓀴put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”
9628𓀴
9629𓀴“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to
9630𓀴this morning.”
9631𓀴
9632𓀴“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
9633𓀴little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
9634𓀴has told is the worse for it.”
9635𓀴
9636𓀴Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
9637𓀴said:--
9638𓀴
9639𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
9640𓀴is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
9641𓀴present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
9642𓀴what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,
9643𓀴and handed it back, saying:--
9644𓀴
9645𓀴“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
9646𓀴but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
9647𓀴honour you--as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with
9648𓀴another blush and a bright smile.
9649𓀴
9650𓀴And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
9651𓀴and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
9652𓀴and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us
9653𓀴have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
9654𓀴be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
9655𓀴terrible and mysterious enemy.
9656𓀴
9657𓀴
9658𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
9659𓀴
9660𓀴_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward’s study two hours after
9661𓀴dinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
9662𓀴board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
9663𓀴which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
9664𓀴next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
9665𓀴next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
9666𓀴Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
9667𓀴centre. The Professor said:--
9668𓀴
9669𓀴“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
9670𓀴that are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:--
9671𓀴
9672𓀴“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
9673𓀴enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
9674𓀴something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
9675𓀴So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
9676𓀴according.
9677𓀴
9678𓀴“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
9679𓀴exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
9680𓀴teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
9681𓀴peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
9682𓀴through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
9683𓀴have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See! see!
9684𓀴I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,
9685𓀴had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
9686𓀴us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
9687𓀴poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
9688𓀴like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
9689𓀴stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
9690𓀴amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
9691𓀴cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
9692𓀴still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
9693𓀴divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
9694𓀴for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
9695𓀴callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
9696𓀴at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
9697𓀴can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
9698𓀴thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
9699𓀴the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
9700𓀴small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
9701𓀴begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
9702𓀴found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
9703𓀴task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
9704𓀴shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
9705𓀴where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
9706𓀴mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
9707𓀴become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
9708𓀴preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
9709𓀴ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
9710𓀴We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’s
9711𓀴sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
9712𓀴to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
9713𓀴but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
9714𓀴song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
9715𓀴young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
9716𓀴say you?”
9717𓀴
9718𓀴Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
9719𓀴much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
9720𓀴saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so
9721𓀴strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for
9722𓀴itself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.
9723𓀴
9724𓀴When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
9725𓀴in his; there was no need for speaking between us.
9726𓀴
9727𓀴“I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.
9728𓀴
9729𓀴“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.
9730𓀴
9731𓀴“I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no other
9732𓀴reason.”
9733𓀴
9734𓀴Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
9735𓀴golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
9736𓀴his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
9737𓀴his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
9738𓀴solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
9739𓀴occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
9740𓀴went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
9741𓀴had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
9742𓀴as any other transaction of life:--
9743𓀴
9744𓀴“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
9745𓀴without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power
9746𓀴denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
9747𓀴act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
9748𓀴In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
9749𓀴free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
9750𓀴achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.
9751𓀴
9752𓀴“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
9753𓀴restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
9754𓀴limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
9755𓀴
9756𓀴“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
9757𓀴at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
9758𓀴of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
9759𓀴first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
9760𓀴secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
9761𓀴superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
9762𓀴others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would
9763𓀴have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
9764𓀴sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
9765𓀴that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
9766𓀴vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
9767𓀴moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
9768𓀴that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
9769𓀴all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
9770𓀴far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
9771𓀴this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
9772𓀴devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
9773𓀴have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
9774𓀴beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
9775𓀴experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
9776𓀴time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
9777𓀴living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
9778𓀴younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
9779𓀴they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
9780𓀴cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
9781𓀴Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
9782𓀴He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
9783𓀴Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
9784𓀴Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
9785𓀴from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
9786𓀴from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
9787𓀴bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
9788𓀴saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
9789𓀴the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble
9790𓀴ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
9791𓀴he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
9792𓀴come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
9793𓀴sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw
9794𓀴Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
9795𓀴tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
9796𓀴into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
9797𓀴fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,
9798𓀴in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
9799𓀴through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
9800𓀴more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
9801𓀴He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
9802𓀴some of nature’s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
9803𓀴first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
9804𓀴though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
9805𓀴that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
9806𓀴can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
9807𓀴bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
9808𓀴These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
9809𓀴inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
9810𓀴have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
9811𓀴unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
9812𓀴Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
9813𓀴said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
9814𓀴of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
9815𓀴power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
9816𓀴symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
9817𓀴them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
9818𓀴silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
9819𓀴lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
9820𓀴coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
9821𓀴coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
9822𓀴him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
9823𓀴We have seen it with our eyes.
9824𓀴
9825𓀴“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
9826𓀴him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
9827𓀴clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
9828𓀴make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
9829𓀴has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
9830𓀴name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
9831𓀴Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
9832𓀴and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
9833𓀴cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the
9834𓀴forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
9835𓀴grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
9836𓀴Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
9837𓀴were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
9838𓀴learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
9839𓀴Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
9840𓀴records are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and
9841𓀴‘pokol’--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
9842𓀴spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been
9843𓀴from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
9844𓀴graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
9845𓀴is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
9846𓀴all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”
9847𓀴
9848𓀴Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
9849𓀴and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
9850𓀴pause, and then the Professor went on:--
9851𓀴
9852𓀴“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
9853𓀴proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
9854𓀴that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
9855𓀴were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
9856𓀴have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
9857𓀴ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
9858𓀴where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
9859𓀴latter, we must trace----”
9860𓀴
9861𓀴Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
9862𓀴the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
9863𓀴bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
9864𓀴far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
9865𓀴out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
9866𓀴window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’s voice
9867𓀴without:--
9868𓀴
9869𓀴“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
9870𓀴it.” A minute later he came in and said:--
9871𓀴
9872𓀴“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
9873𓀴Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
9874𓀴the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
9875𓀴and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
9876𓀴brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
9877𓀴have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
9878𓀴seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”
9879𓀴
9880𓀴“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.
9881𓀴
9882𓀴“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without
9883𓀴saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
9884𓀴statement:--
9885𓀴
9886𓀴“We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
9887𓀴either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
9888𓀴speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
9889𓀴Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
9890𓀴noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.
9891𓀴
9892𓀴“And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
9893𓀴You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you
9894𓀴no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
9895𓀴and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
9896𓀴shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
9897𓀴are.”
9898𓀴
9899𓀴All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
9900𓀴good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
9901𓀴safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
9902𓀴minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
9903𓀴I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
9904𓀴
9905𓀴Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--
9906𓀴
9907𓀴“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
9908𓀴now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
9909𓀴another victim.”
9910𓀴
9911𓀴I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
9912𓀴close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
9913𓀴appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
9914𓀴me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
9915𓀴with means to get into the house.
9916𓀴
9917𓀴Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
9918𓀴sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
9919𓀴to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.
9920𓀴
9921𓀴
9922𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
9923𓀴
9924𓀴_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an
9925𓀴urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
9926𓀴him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
9927𓀴I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
9928𓀴morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--
9929𓀴
9930𓀴“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’t
9931𓀴know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his
9932𓀴violent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some
9933𓀴cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others to
9934𓀴wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”
9935𓀴
9936𓀴“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your
9937𓀴diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
9938𓀴case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
9939𓀴disturbed.”
9940𓀴
9941𓀴“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.
9942𓀴
9943𓀴“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, and
9944𓀴we all went down the passage together.
9945𓀴
9946𓀴We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
9947𓀴rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
9948𓀴unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
9949𓀴met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
9950𓀴prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
9951𓀴none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
9952𓀴at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
9953𓀴with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
9954𓀴existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will,
9955𓀴perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
9956𓀴not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
9957𓀴introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
9958𓀴besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of
9959𓀴the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord
9960𓀴Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
9961𓀴Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--
9962𓀴
9963𓀴“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
9964𓀴Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
9965𓀴more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
9966𓀴youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
9967𓀴patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
9968𓀴state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
9969𓀴far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
9970𓀴alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
9971𓀴vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
9972𓀴place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
9973𓀴meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
9974𓀴conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
9975𓀴by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
9976𓀴conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
9977𓀴one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
9978𓀴the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
9979𓀴places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
9980𓀴least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
9981𓀴And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
9982𓀴well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
9983𓀴be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last
9984𓀴appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
9985𓀴charm.
9986𓀴
9987𓀴I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
9988𓀴conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,
9989𓀴that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
9990𓀴tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
9991𓀴necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
9992𓀴better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
9993𓀴I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
9994𓀴So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
9995𓀴to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
9996𓀴in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
9997𓀴meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
9998𓀴quickly:--
9999𓀴
10000𓀴“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
10001𓀴go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time
10002𓀴presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
10003𓀴the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
10004𓀴before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
10005𓀴momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and
10006𓀴seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
10007𓀴them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--
10008𓀴
10009𓀴“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”
10010𓀴
10011𓀴“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
10012𓀴There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--
10013𓀴
10014𓀴“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
10015𓀴this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
10016𓀴in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
10017𓀴am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
10018𓀴assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
10019𓀴unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
10020𓀴sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
10021𓀴animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
10022𓀴your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
10023𓀴conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
10024𓀴but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
10025𓀴him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
10026𓀴all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
10027𓀴him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
10028𓀴with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
10029𓀴which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
10030𓀴afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--
10031𓀴
10032𓀴“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
10033𓀴to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
10034𓀴without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.
10035𓀴Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
10036𓀴privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
10037𓀴poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--
10038𓀴
10039𓀴“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
10040𓀴highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
10041𓀴reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
10042𓀴you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
10043𓀴you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
10044𓀴we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
10045𓀴us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook
10046𓀴his head as he said:--
10047𓀴
10048𓀴“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
10049𓀴if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
10050𓀴own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
10051𓀴refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was now
10052𓀴time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
10053𓀴towards the door, simply saying:--
10054𓀴
10055𓀴“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”
10056𓀴
10057𓀴As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
10058𓀴moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
10059𓀴about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
10060𓀴groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
10061𓀴petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
10062𓀴emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
10063𓀴relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
10064𓀴and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
10065𓀴fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
10066𓀴efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
10067𓀴constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
10068𓀴which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
10069𓀴wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
10070𓀴sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
10071𓀴for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
10072𓀴quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
10073𓀴his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
10074𓀴torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
10075𓀴whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--
10076𓀴
10077𓀴“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
10078𓀴of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
10079𓀴send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
10080𓀴strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
10081𓀴out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am
10082𓀴speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don’t know
10083𓀴whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
10084𓀴By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
10085𓀴lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
10086𓀴of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t you
10087𓀴understand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and
10088𓀴earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
10089𓀴for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”
10090𓀴
10091𓀴I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
10092𓀴would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.
10093𓀴
10094𓀴“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough
10095𓀴already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”
10096𓀴
10097𓀴He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
10098𓀴without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
10099𓀴bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
10100𓀴expected.
10101𓀴
10102𓀴When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
10103𓀴quiet, well-bred voice:--
10104𓀴
10105𓀴“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
10106𓀴on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”
10107𓀴

10111𓀴CHAPTER XIX
10112𓀴
10113𓀴JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
10114𓀴
10115𓀴
10116𓀴_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy
10117𓀴mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
10118𓀴so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
10119𓀴Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
10120𓀴all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
10121𓀴brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
10122𓀴that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
10123𓀴that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
10124𓀴little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
10125𓀴room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
10126𓀴to Dr. Seward:--
10127𓀴
10128𓀴“Say, Jack, if that man wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about the
10129𓀴sanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some
10130𓀴serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
10131𓀴chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--
10132𓀴
10133𓀴“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it,
10134𓀴for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
10135𓀴hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
10136𓀴our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
10137𓀴All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
10138𓀴dreamy kind of way:--
10139𓀴
10140𓀴“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
10141𓀴ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
10142𓀴seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
10143𓀴afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget how
10144𓀴he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
10145𓀴throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and
10146𓀴master,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
10147𓀴That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
10148𓀴him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
10149𓀴certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
10150𓀴best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
10151𓀴help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
10152𓀴on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--
10153𓀴
10154𓀴“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
10155𓀴and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
10156𓀴hope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped
10157𓀴away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
10158𓀴whistle, as he remarked:--
10159𓀴
10160𓀴“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote on
10161𓀴call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
10162𓀴to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
10163𓀴out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
10164𓀴a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
10165𓀴little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--
10166𓀴
10167𓀴“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
10168𓀴many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
10169𓀴strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
10170𓀴of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
10171𓀴amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
10172𓀴in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
10173𓀴as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
10174𓀴touch. Keep this near your heart”--as he spoke he lifted a little silver
10175𓀴crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--“put these
10176𓀴flowers round your neck”--here he handed to me a wreath of withered
10177𓀴garlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
10178𓀴knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
10179𓀴fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
10180𓀴which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of Sacred
10181𓀴Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
10182𓀴was similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are the
10183𓀴skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
10184𓀴by the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”
10185𓀴
10186𓀴Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
10187𓀴surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
10188𓀴a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
10189𓀴clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
10190𓀴it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
10191𓀴Dr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy that
10192𓀴the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
10193𓀴shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
10194𓀴into the open door.
10195𓀴
10196𓀴“_In manus tuas, Domine!_” he said, crossing himself as he passed over
10197𓀴the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
10198𓀴lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
10199𓀴Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
10200𓀴from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
10201𓀴lamps and proceeded on our search.
10202𓀴
10203𓀴The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
10204𓀴rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
10205𓀴shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
10206𓀴was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
10207𓀴powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
10208𓀴experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
10209𓀴for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
10210𓀴sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.
10211𓀴
10212𓀴The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
10213𓀴deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
10214𓀴my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
10215𓀴walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
10216𓀴spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
10217𓀴tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
10218𓀴hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They
10219𓀴had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
10220𓀴in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
10221𓀴lifted them. He turned to me and said:--
10222𓀴
10223𓀴“You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
10224𓀴it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I had an
10225𓀴idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
10226𓀴get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
10227𓀴found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
10228𓀴“This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
10229𓀴map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
10230𓀴regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
10231𓀴bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
10232𓀴as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
10233𓀴through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
10234𓀴encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
10235𓀴quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
10236𓀴his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
10237𓀴a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
10238𓀴close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
10239𓀴an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
10240𓀴air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
10241𓀴alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
10242𓀴pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
10243𓀴become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
10244𓀴exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
10245𓀴intensified its loathsomeness.
10246𓀴
10247𓀴Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
10248𓀴enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
10249𓀴terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
10250𓀴above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
10251𓀴consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
10252𓀴work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.
10253𓀴
10254𓀴We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
10255𓀴began:--
10256𓀴
10257𓀴“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
10258𓀴examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
10259𓀴clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to show
10260𓀴how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
10261𓀴no mistaking them.
10262𓀴
10263𓀴There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
10264𓀴for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
10265𓀴door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
10266𓀴heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
10267𓀴see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
10268𓀴red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
10269𓀴as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
10270𓀴shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
10271𓀴and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
10272𓀴were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
10273𓀴walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I
10274𓀴took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
10275𓀴
10276𓀴A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
10277𓀴he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
10278𓀴undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
10279𓀴of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
10280𓀴back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.
10281𓀴
10282𓀴For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
10283𓀴seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
10284𓀴iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
10285𓀴and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
10286𓀴huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
10287𓀴whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
10288𓀴from behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
10289𓀴minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
10290𓀴Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
10291𓀴noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
10292𓀴taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
10293𓀴elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
10294𓀴swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
10295𓀴moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
10296𓀴like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
10297𓀴threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
10298𓀴their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
10299𓀴multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
10300𓀴
10301𓀴Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
10302𓀴on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
10303𓀴recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
10304𓀴him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
10305𓀴dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
10306𓀴ere the whole mass had vanished.
10307𓀴
10308𓀴With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
10309𓀴the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
10310𓀴their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
10311𓀴the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
10312𓀴Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
10313𓀴the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
10314𓀴in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
10315𓀴slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
10316𓀴of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
10317𓀴resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
10318𓀴bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
10319𓀴nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
10320𓀴untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
10321𓀴Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
10322𓀴we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
10323𓀴rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.
10324𓀴
10325𓀴The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
10326𓀴Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
10327𓀴locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
10328𓀴when he had done.
10329𓀴
10330𓀴“So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
10331𓀴come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
10332𓀴many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
10333𓀴first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
10334𓀴accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
10335𓀴troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
10336𓀴smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
10337𓀴learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
10338𓀴beasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable
10339𓀴to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
10340𓀴call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
10341𓀴to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
10342𓀴from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
10343𓀴before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
10344𓀴his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
10345𓀴So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
10346𓀴to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
10347𓀴stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
10348𓀴and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. It may be
10349𓀴ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
10350𓀴but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”
10351𓀴
10352𓀴The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
10353𓀴was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
10354𓀴from Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
10355𓀴after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
10356𓀴
10357𓀴I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
10358𓀴softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
10359𓀴usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
10360𓀴thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
10361𓀴deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
10362𓀴think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
10363𓀴settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
10364𓀴to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
10365𓀴suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
10366𓀴sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
10367𓀴is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
10368𓀴daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
10369𓀴confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep
10370𓀴dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
10371𓀴has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.

10375𓀴_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all
10376𓀴overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
10377𓀴rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
10378𓀴till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
10379𓀴three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
10380𓀴few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
10381𓀴blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
10382𓀴complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
10383𓀴day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
10384𓀴that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
10385𓀴them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
10386𓀴sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
10387𓀴Snelling to-day.
10388𓀴
10389𓀴
10390𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
10391𓀴
10392𓀴_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
10393𓀴walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
10394𓀴is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the
10395𓀴brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
10396𓀴night he suddenly said:--
10397𓀴
10398𓀴“Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
10399𓀴this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
10400𓀴be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
10401𓀴and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
10402𓀴that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
10403𓀴keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
10404𓀴instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
10405𓀴getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I
10406𓀴want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
10407𓀴things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
10408𓀴he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”
10409𓀴
10410𓀴“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on the
10411𓀴type-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
10412𓀴statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
10413𓀴nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
10414𓀴Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said.
10415𓀴“Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
10416𓀴is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
10417𓀴such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
10418𓀴folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
10419𓀴Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
10420𓀴hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
10421𓀴Van Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he
10422𓀴stood at the door.
10423𓀴
10424𓀴“Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
10425𓀴I can go with you now, if you like.
10426𓀴
10427𓀴“It is needless; I have seen him!”
10428𓀴
10429𓀴“Well?”
10430𓀴
10431𓀴“I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
10432𓀴When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
10433𓀴his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
10434𓀴discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
10435𓀴measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’t
10436𓀴you know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you well
10437𓀴enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
10438𓀴and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
10439𓀴Dutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
10440𓀴sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
10441𓀴all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
10442𓀴clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
10443𓀴happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
10444𓀴rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
10445𓀴worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
10446𓀴is better so.”
10447𓀴
10448𓀴“I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly, for I did
10449𓀴not want him to weaken in this matter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
10450𓀴Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
10451𓀴been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
10452𓀴and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
10453𓀴infallibly have wrecked her.”
10454𓀴
10455𓀴So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
10456𓀴and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
10457𓀴shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.

10460𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
10461𓀴
10462𓀴_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
10463𓀴after Jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him
10464𓀴manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
10465𓀴morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
10466𓀴Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
10467𓀴out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
10468𓀴what had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he must
10469𓀴have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
10470𓀴must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
10471𓀴it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
10472𓀴I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
10473𓀴crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband’s great
10474𓀴love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
10475𓀴
10476𓀴That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
10477𓀴lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
10478𓀴anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
10479𓀴feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
10480𓀴heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
10481𓀴low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
10482𓀴excitement.
10483𓀴
10484𓀴Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
10485𓀴me to. I didn’t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
10486𓀴kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
10487𓀴see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
10488𓀴pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
10489𓀴seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
10490𓀴is most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
10491𓀴Lucy would be with us now. She hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard
10492𓀴till I came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with me she
10493𓀴wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at
10494𓀴night and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as he did.
10495𓀴Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
10496𓀴has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
10497𓀴that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
10498𓀴own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
10499𓀴fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
10500𓀴feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
10501𓀴that we poor women have to learn....
10502𓀴
10503𓀴I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
10504𓀴the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
10505𓀴on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is somewhere
10506𓀴under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
10507𓀴profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
10508𓀴All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
10509𓀴seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
10510𓀴stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
10511𓀴streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
10512𓀴across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
10513𓀴vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
10514𓀴have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
10515𓀴creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
10516𓀴and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
10517𓀴close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
10518𓀴wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
10519𓀴more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
10520𓀴I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
10521𓀴his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
10522𓀴attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
10523𓀴bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
10524𓀴I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
10525𓀴fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
10526𓀴morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
10527𓀴little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
10528𓀴bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
10529𓀴the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
10530𓀴
10531𓀴I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
10532𓀴was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
10533𓀴hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
10534𓀴usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
10535𓀴upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
10536𓀴clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
10537𓀴around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
10538𓀴came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
10539𓀴grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
10540𓀴had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
10541𓀴make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
10542𓀴limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
10543𓀴my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
10544𓀴tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
10545𓀴mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
10546𓀴could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
10547𓀴water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
10548𓀴the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
10549𓀴concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
10550𓀴of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
10551𓀴began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
10552𓀴whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a
10553𓀴pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such
10554𓀴spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
10555𓀴composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
10556𓀴red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
10557𓀴looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
10558𓀴two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
10559𓀴when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s
10560𓀴Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
10561𓀴had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
10562𓀴in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
10563𓀴black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
10564𓀴show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
10565𓀴careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were
10566𓀴too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
10567𓀴something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
10568𓀴them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
10569𓀴fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
10570𓀴not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
10571𓀴cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Last
10572𓀴night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.

10575𓀴
10576𓀴_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
10577𓀴slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
10578𓀴sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
10579𓀴spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
10580𓀴In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
10581𓀴very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
10582𓀴me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
10583𓀴is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
10584𓀴miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
10585𓀴dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
10586𓀴them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
10587𓀴tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
10588𓀴together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
10589𓀴of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan’s
10590𓀴manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
10591𓀴sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
10592𓀴give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
10593𓀴before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
10594𓀴me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
10595𓀴have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
10596𓀴I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
10597𓀴comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
10598𓀴power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.

10605𓀴JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
10606𓀴
10607𓀴
10608𓀴_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
10609𓀴Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
10610𓀴very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
10611𓀴proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
10612𓀴learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
10613𓀴was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
10614𓀴responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
10615𓀴Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
10616𓀴saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
10617𓀴type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
10618𓀴about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-eared
10619𓀴notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
10620𓀴seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
10621𓀴half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
10622𓀴were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
10623𓀴197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
10624𓀴deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
10625𓀴scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
10626𓀴chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
10627𓀴fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
10628𓀴he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
10629𓀴fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
10630𓀴shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
10631𓀴be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
10632𓀴very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
10633𓀴to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
10634𓀴been taken from Carfax.
10635𓀴
10636𓀴He replied:--
10637𓀴
10638𓀴“Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”--I had given him half a
10639𓀴sovereign--“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
10640𓀴Bloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in Pincher’s Alley,
10641𓀴as ’ow he an’ his mate ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a old ’ouse at
10642𓀴Purfect. There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’
10643𓀴that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell me
10644𓀴where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
10645𓀴would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
10646𓀴of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
10647𓀴then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--
10648𓀴
10649𓀴“Look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’ you ’ere. I
10650𓀴may find Sam soon, or I mayn’t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a way
10651𓀴to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
10652𓀴If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
10653𓀴it, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
10654𓀴ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch
10655𓀴’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”
10656𓀴
10657𓀴This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
10658𓀴buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
10659𓀴came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
10660𓀴again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
10661𓀴to home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
10662𓀴Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
10663𓀴though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to be
10664𓀴kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
10665𓀴others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
10666𓀴worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
10667𓀴were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
10668𓀴business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
10669𓀴must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
10670𓀴circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
10671𓀴herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
10672𓀴Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.

10675𓀴
10676𓀴_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
10677𓀴post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
10678𓀴which was written with a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand:--
10679𓀴
10680𓀴“Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
10681𓀴the depite.”
10682𓀴
10683𓀴I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
10684𓀴and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
10685𓀴but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
10686𓀴her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
10687𓀴with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
10688𓀴in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
10689𓀴was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
10690𓀴have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
10691𓀴difficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I asked
10692𓀴for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had found
10693𓀴the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house.
10694𓀴When I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his
10695𓀴head, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never
10696𓀴’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobody
10697𓀴of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, and
10698𓀴as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
10699𓀴of the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.
10700𓀴
10701𓀴“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
10702𓀴track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
10703𓀴deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
10704𓀴had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
10705𓀴Corcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that
10706𓀴morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
10707𓀴he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”;
10708𓀴and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
10709𓀴o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
10710𓀴I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
10711𓀴of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
10712𓀴new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a
10713𓀴“new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
10714𓀴gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
10715𓀴coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
10716𓀴suggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for
10717𓀴the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
10718𓀴a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
10719𓀴promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
10720𓀴that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
10721𓀴and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“main
10722𓀴heavy ones”--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
10723𓀴asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
10724𓀴which he replied:--
10725𓀴
10726𓀴“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
10727𓀴big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
10728𓀴dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we
10729𓀴tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”
10730𓀴
10731𓀴“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”
10732𓀴
10733𓀴“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at
10734𓀴Purfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
10735𓀴me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller,
10736𓀴with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throw
10737𓀴a shadder.”
10738𓀴
10739𓀴How this phrase thrilled through me!
10740𓀴
10741𓀴“Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
10742𓀴me a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an’ I’m no
10743𓀴chicken, neither.”
10744𓀴
10745𓀴“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.
10746𓀴
10747𓀴“He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for
10748𓀴when I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me
10749𓀴to carry the boxes into the ’all.”
10750𓀴
10751𓀴“The whole nine?” I asked.
10752𓀴
10753𓀴“Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was
10754𓀴main dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I
10755𓀴interrupted him:--
10756𓀴
10757𓀴“Were the boxes left in the hall?”
10758𓀴
10759𓀴“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made one
10760𓀴more attempt to further matters:--
10761𓀴
10762𓀴“You didn’t have any key?”
10763𓀴
10764𓀴“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door ’isself
10765𓀴an’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last time--but
10766𓀴that was the beer.”
10767𓀴
10768𓀴“And you can’t remember the number of the house?”
10769𓀴
10770𓀴“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’un
10771𓀴with a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. I
10772𓀴know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
10773𓀴what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’
10774𓀴they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them
10775𓀴by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot
10776𓀴of them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I could
10777𓀴find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
10778𓀴off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
10779𓀴could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was
10780𓀴precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
10781𓀴distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
10782𓀴unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
10783𓀴westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
10784𓀴described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
10785𓀴arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
10786𓀴untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
10787𓀴up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
10788𓀴had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
10789𓀴a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
10790𓀴roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
10791𓀴Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
10792𓀴whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
10793𓀴been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
10794𓀴given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
10795𓀴experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
10796𓀴but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
10797𓀴discovered of gaining access to the house.
10798𓀴
10799𓀴There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
10800𓀴nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
10801𓀴could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
10802𓀴Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
10803𓀴grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
10804𓀴about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
10805𓀴taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
10806𓀴very lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that
10807𓀴perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
10808𓀴something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
10809𓀴the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
10810𓀴or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
10811𓀴away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
10812𓀴did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
10813𓀴Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
10814𓀴Sackville Street.
10815𓀴
10816𓀴The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
10817𓀴uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
10818𓀴Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a
10819𓀴“mansion”--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
10820𓀴asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
10821𓀴paused a few seconds before replying:--
10822𓀴
10823𓀴“It is sold, sir.”
10824𓀴
10825𓀴“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special reason
10826𓀴for wishing to know who purchased it.”
10827𓀴
10828𓀴Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is sold,
10829𓀴sir,” was again his laconic reply.
10830𓀴
10831𓀴“Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”
10832𓀴
10833𓀴“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are
10834𓀴absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This was
10835𓀴manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
10836𓀴him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--
10837𓀴
10838𓀴“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
10839𓀴confidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card.
10840𓀴“In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
10841𓀴Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
10842𓀴he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion
10843𓀴on affairs. He said:--
10844𓀴
10845𓀴“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
10846𓀴I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
10847𓀴renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
10848𓀴Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consult
10849𓀴the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
10850𓀴lordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
10851𓀴deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
10852𓀴lordship.”
10853𓀴
10854𓀴I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
10855𓀴gave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark, and I
10856𓀴was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company
10857𓀴and came down to Purfleet by the next train.
10858𓀴
10859𓀴I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
10860𓀴made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
10861𓀴think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
10862𓀴inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
10863𓀴our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
10864𓀴confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
10865𓀴keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
10866𓀴else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
10867𓀴any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
10868𓀴made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
10869𓀴knowledge would be torture to her.
10870𓀴
10871𓀴I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;
10872𓀴so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even
10873𓀴amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
10874𓀴The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
10875𓀴as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
10876𓀴came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
10877𓀴difference between us.
10878𓀴
10879𓀴When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
10880𓀴the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
10881𓀴it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
10882𓀴information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--
10883𓀴
10884𓀴“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
10885𓀴the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
10886𓀴our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
10887𓀴until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
10888𓀴wretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
10889𓀴Morris spoke:--
10890𓀴
10891𓀴“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”
10892𓀴
10893𓀴“We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.
10894𓀴
10895𓀴“But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
10896𓀴and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
10897𓀴commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’t
10898𓀴see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
10899𓀴of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
10900𓀴morning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
10901𓀴about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to
10902𓀴another of us:--
10903𓀴
10904𓀴“Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
10905𓀴got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we
10906𓀴can find the Count’s key basket.”
10907𓀴
10908𓀴As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
10909𓀴least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell’s,
10910𓀴we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
10911𓀴while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
10912𓀴bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
10913𓀴moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
10914𓀴
10915𓀴Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
10916𓀴forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
10917𓀴in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
10918𓀴did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
10919𓀴herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!
10920𓀴
10921𓀴
10922𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
10923𓀴
10924𓀴_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
10925𓀴rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
10926𓀴always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
10927𓀴than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
10928𓀴repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
10929𓀴He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really
10930𓀴care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
10931𓀴looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
10932𓀴thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
10933𓀴him:--
10934𓀴
10935𓀴“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superior
10936𓀴sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as
10937𓀴he answered me:--
10938𓀴
10939𓀴“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
10940𓀴of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
10941𓀴when they typified the soul as a butterfly!”
10942𓀴
10943𓀴I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
10944𓀴quickly:--
10945𓀴
10946𓀴“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his
10947𓀴reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
10948𓀴with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--
10949𓀴
10950𓀴“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he brightened
10951𓀴up; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
10952𓀴have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
10953𓀴study zoöphagy!”
10954𓀴
10955𓀴This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--
10956𓀴
10957𓀴“Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with an
10958𓀴ineffably benign superiority.
10959𓀴
10960𓀴“Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
10961𓀴Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
10962𓀴may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
10963𓀴purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
10964𓀴spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
10965𓀴Enoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
10966𓀴that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--
10967𓀴
10968𓀴“And why with Enoch?”
10969𓀴
10970𓀴“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not
10971𓀴like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--
10972𓀴
10973𓀴“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I put
10974𓀴my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
10975𓀴The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
10976𓀴old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
10977𓀴he replied:--
10978𓀴
10979𓀴“I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’t use them if
10980𓀴I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat them
10981𓀴or----” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
10982𓀴face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as to
10983𓀴life, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and you
10984𓀴know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good
10985𓀴friends--like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer of
10986𓀴inexpressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack the means of
10987𓀴life!”
10988𓀴
10989𓀴I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
10990𓀴antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
10991𓀴he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it
10992𓀴was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.
10993𓀴
10994𓀴Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
10995𓀴without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
10996𓀴that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
10997𓀴to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
10998𓀴Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
10999𓀴record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
11000𓀴knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
11001𓀴to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
11002𓀴me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
11003𓀴might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
11004𓀴might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
11005𓀴alone.
11006𓀴
11007𓀴I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
11008𓀴which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
11009𓀴came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
11010𓀴lips:--
11011𓀴
11012𓀴“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been
11013𓀴correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
11014𓀴lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them
11015𓀴yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
11016𓀴him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for
11017𓀴an answer.
11018𓀴
11019𓀴“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
11020𓀴matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to “be
11021𓀴cruel only to be kind.” So I said:--
11022𓀴
11023𓀴“You like life, and you want life?”
11024𓀴
11025𓀴“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”
11026𓀴
11027𓀴“But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul
11028𓀴also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--
11029𓀴
11030𓀴“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with
11031𓀴the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
11032𓀴and twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, you
11033𓀴know, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affect
11034𓀴his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
11035𓀴screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
11036𓀴soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
11037𓀴me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,
11038𓀴though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It
11039𓀴was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
11040𓀴and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
11041𓀴to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and
11042𓀴go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
11043𓀴speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--
11044𓀴
11045𓀴“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed to
11046𓀴wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--
11047𓀴
11048𓀴“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added,
11049𓀴“But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”
11050𓀴
11051𓀴“Or spiders?” I went on.
11052𓀴
11053𓀴“Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in them
11054𓀴to eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
11055𓀴topic.
11056𓀴
11057𓀴“So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenly
11058𓀴stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed himself
11059𓀴aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract
11060𓀴my attention from it:--
11061𓀴
11062𓀴“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such
11063𓀴small deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they
11064𓀴might be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
11065𓀴ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
11066𓀴interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
11067𓀴me.”
11068𓀴
11069𓀴“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
11070𓀴in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”
11071𓀴
11072𓀴“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wide
11073𓀴awake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I said
11074𓀴reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”
11075𓀴
11076𓀴The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
11077𓀴high-horse and became a child again.
11078𓀴
11079𓀴“I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a
11080𓀴few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
11081𓀴his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To
11082𓀴hell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me about
11083𓀴souls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,
11084𓀴without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I thought he was
11085𓀴in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,
11086𓀴however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--
11087𓀴
11088𓀴“Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
11089𓀴worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
11090𓀴problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
11091𓀴tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I
11092𓀴want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
11093𓀴sure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when the
11094𓀴attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
11095𓀴watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
11096𓀴dignity and sweetness:--
11097𓀴
11098𓀴“Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
11099𓀴I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in this
11100𓀴mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
11101𓀴this man’s state. Several points seem to make what the American
11102𓀴interviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order.
11103𓀴Here they are:--
11104𓀴
11105𓀴Will not mention “drinking.”
11106𓀴
11107𓀴Fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.
11108𓀴
11109𓀴Has no dread of wanting “life” in the future.
11110𓀴
11111𓀴Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
11112𓀴haunted by their souls.
11113𓀴
11114𓀴Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
11115𓀴that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the
11116𓀴burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!

11118𓀴And the assurance--?
11119𓀴
11120𓀴Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
11121𓀴terror afoot!

11124𓀴
11125𓀴_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
11126𓀴suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
11127𓀴while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door
11128𓀴we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
11129𓀴which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
11130𓀴he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
11131𓀴autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
11132𓀴of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He
11133𓀴went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had
11134𓀴got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come
11135𓀴away as ignorant as we went in.
11136𓀴
11137𓀴His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.

11144𓀴“My Lord,
11145𓀴
11146𓀴“We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
11147𓀴regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
11148𓀴behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
11149𓀴purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
11150𓀴of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
11151𓀴nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
11152𓀴purchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your Lordship will pardon
11153𓀴us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever
11154𓀴of him.

11163𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
11164𓀴
11165𓀴_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
11166𓀴make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’s room,
11167𓀴and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
11168𓀴was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
11169𓀴in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
11170𓀴and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
11171𓀴and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.
11172𓀴
11173𓀴Before going to bed I went round to the patient’s room and looked in
11174𓀴through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
11175𓀴rose and fell with regular respiration.
11176𓀴
11177𓀴This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight
11178𓀴he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him
11179𓀴if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was
11180𓀴something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if
11181𓀴he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” for
11182𓀴a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
11183𓀴watched.
11184𓀴
11185𓀴To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
11186𓀴looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
11187𓀴horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
11188𓀴seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
11189𓀴earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
11190𓀴weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
11191𓀴British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
11192𓀴physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
11193𓀴and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
11194𓀴useful to us later.
11195𓀴
11196𓀴I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
11197𓀴strait-waistcoats.

11201𓀴_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our
11202𓀴work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if
11203𓀴Renfield’s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so
11204𓀴followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the
11205𓀴monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get
11206𓀴some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
11207𓀴with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
11208𓀴valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That
11209𓀴wild yell seemed to come from his room....

11212𓀴
11213𓀴The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
11214𓀴somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went
11215𓀴to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
11216𓀴I must go at once....

11222𓀴
11223𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
11224𓀴
11225𓀴
11226𓀴_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well
11227𓀴as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I
11228𓀴can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.
11229𓀴
11230𓀴When I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying on the floor on his
11231𓀴left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it
11232𓀴became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;
11233𓀴there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
11234𓀴which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see
11235𓀴that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
11236𓀴floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
11237𓀴originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as
11238𓀴we turned him over:--
11239𓀴
11240𓀴“I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
11241𓀴the whole side of his face are paralysed.” How such a thing could have
11242𓀴happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite
11243𓀴bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--
11244𓀴
11245𓀴“I can’t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by
11246𓀴beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the
11247𓀴Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he
11248𓀴might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward
11249𓀴kink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two things
11250𓀴occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if his
11251𓀴face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
11252𓀴it.” I said to him:--
11253𓀴
11254𓀴“Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want
11255𓀴him without an instant’s delay.” The man ran off, and within a few
11256𓀴minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When
11257𓀴he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
11258𓀴then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
11259𓀴said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--
11260𓀴
11261𓀴“Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much
11262𓀴attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.
11263𓀴If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.”
11264𓀴
11265𓀴The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
11266𓀴he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with
11267𓀴extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had
11268𓀴evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
11269𓀴looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--
11270𓀴
11271𓀴“Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes
11272𓀴conscious, after the operation.” So I said:--
11273𓀴
11274𓀴“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at
11275𓀴present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
11276𓀴Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”
11277𓀴
11278𓀴The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
11279𓀴The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed
11280𓀴fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The
11281𓀴Professor thought a moment and said:--
11282𓀴
11283𓀴“We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
11284𓀴as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
11285𓀴his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the
11286𓀴brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
11287𓀴too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I
11288𓀴went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and
11289𓀴Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--
11290𓀴
11291𓀴“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
11292𓀴So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things
11293𓀴are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
11294𓀴these times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
11295𓀴as they have been. We’ll have to look back--and forward a little more
11296𓀴than we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open
11297𓀴till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the
11298𓀴attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
11299𓀴floor, he said softly:--
11300𓀴
11301𓀴“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him
11302𓀴briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after
11303𓀴the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat
11304𓀴down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched
11305𓀴in patience.
11306𓀴
11307𓀴“We shall wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enough to fix the best
11308𓀴spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
11309𓀴the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”
11310𓀴
11311𓀴The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a
11312𓀴horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gathered
11313𓀴that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded
11314𓀴the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;
11315𓀴but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men
11316𓀴who have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came in
11317𓀴uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes
11318𓀴and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he
11319𓀴would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick
11320𓀴beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost
11321𓀴hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
11322𓀴temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became
11323𓀴agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
11324𓀴their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
11325𓀴torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
11326𓀴some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
11327𓀴it.
11328𓀴
11329𓀴At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
11330𓀴sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor
11331𓀴and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he
11332𓀴spoke:--
11333𓀴
11334𓀴“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have
11335𓀴been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
11336𓀴We shall operate just above the ear.”
11337𓀴
11338𓀴Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the
11339𓀴breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
11340𓀴prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
11341𓀴Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
11342𓀴This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
11343𓀴surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
11344𓀴convulsively, and as he did so, said:--
11345𓀴
11346𓀴“I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I
11347𓀴have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
11348𓀴move. What’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
11349𓀴dreadfully.” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
11350𓀴eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
11351𓀴Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--
11352𓀴
11353𓀴“Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his face
11354𓀴brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--
11355𓀴
11356𓀴“That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some
11357𓀴water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed”--he
11358𓀴stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--“The
11359𓀴brandy--it is in my study--quick!” He flew and returned with a glass,
11360𓀴the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched
11361𓀴lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor
11362𓀴injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite
11363𓀴conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I
11364𓀴shall never forget, and said:--
11365𓀴
11366𓀴“I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.”
11367𓀴Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
11368𓀴figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--
11369𓀴
11370𓀴“If I were not sure already, I would know from them.” For an instant his
11371𓀴eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were
11372𓀴bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,
11373𓀴hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--
11374𓀴
11375𓀴“Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;
11376𓀴and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
11377𓀴again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor
11378𓀴crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left
11379𓀴me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn’t speak then, for I
11380𓀴felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as
11381𓀴I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
11382𓀴me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain
11383𓀴seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the
11384𓀴dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, Van
11385𓀴Helsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
11386𓀴gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly
11387𓀴and said: “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--
11388𓀴
11389𓀴“He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
11390𓀴but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
11391𓀴man’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
11392𓀴teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt
11393𓀴of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come in
11394𓀴at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.
11395𓀴Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.” He
11396𓀴was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--
11397𓀴
11398𓀴“How?”
11399𓀴
11400𓀴“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the
11401𓀴sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
11402𓀴wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
11403𓀴backs.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--
11404𓀴
11405𓀴“The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the
11406𓀴‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping.
11407𓀴
11408𓀴“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
11409𓀴millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
11410𓀴too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
11411𓀴buzzing flies!’ I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
11412𓀴Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He
11413𓀴beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his
11414𓀴hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass
11415𓀴spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and
11416𓀴then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there
11417𓀴were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only
11418𓀴smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he
11419𓀴seemed to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more
11420𓀴and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
11421𓀴me!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
11422𓀴over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening
11423𓀴the sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!’ The rats were
11424𓀴all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
11425𓀴open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through
11426𓀴the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and
11427𓀴splendour.”
11428𓀴
11429𓀴His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
11430𓀴he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
11431𓀴the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him
11432𓀴back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: “Let him go on. Do
11433𓀴not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
11434𓀴if once he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded:--
11435𓀴
11436𓀴“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not
11437𓀴even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.
11438𓀴When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
11439𓀴knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked
11440𓀴out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he
11441𓀴owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn’t even smell the same
11442𓀴as he went by me. I couldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.
11443𓀴Harker had come into the room.”
11444𓀴
11445𓀴The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
11446𓀴him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
11447𓀴They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,
11448𓀴however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without
11449𓀴noticing:--
11450𓀴
11451𓀴“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same;
11452𓀴it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we all moved,
11453𓀴but no one said a word; he went on:--
11454𓀴
11455𓀴“I didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the
11456𓀴same. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood
11457𓀴in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think of it
11458𓀴at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad
11459𓀴to know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I could feel that
11460𓀴the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. “So when
11461𓀴He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I
11462𓀴grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
11463𓀴as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.
11464𓀴Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle
11465𓀴with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn’t
11466𓀴mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned
11467𓀴into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and
11468𓀴when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There
11469𓀴was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
11470𓀴to steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and his
11471𓀴breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.
11472𓀴
11473𓀴“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose.
11474𓀴It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other
11475𓀴night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was no
11476𓀴need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
11477𓀴common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
11478𓀴had when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, and
11479𓀴as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--
11480𓀴
11481𓀴“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
11482𓀴over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.
11483𓀴Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!” He stopped; his
11484𓀴voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in
11485𓀴my own heart.
11486𓀴
11487𓀴Outside the Harkers’ door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the
11488𓀴latter said:--
11489𓀴
11490𓀴“Should we disturb her?”
11491𓀴
11492𓀴“We must,” said Van Helsing grimly. “If the door be locked, I shall
11493𓀴break it in.”
11494𓀴
11495𓀴“May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady’s
11496𓀴room!”
11497𓀴
11498𓀴Van Helsing said solemnly, “You are always right; but this is life and
11499𓀴death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
11500𓀴are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if
11501𓀴the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
11502𓀴too, my friends. Now!”
11503𓀴
11504𓀴He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw
11505𓀴ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell
11506𓀴headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw
11507𓀴across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw
11508𓀴appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
11509𓀴and my heart seemed to stand still.
11510𓀴
11511𓀴The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
11512𓀴was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan
11513𓀴Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
11514𓀴Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
11515𓀴figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
11516𓀴His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
11517𓀴the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left
11518𓀴hand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms
11519𓀴at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
11520𓀴forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared
11521𓀴with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which
11522𓀴was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible
11523𓀴resemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk to
11524𓀴compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
11525𓀴face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap
11526𓀴into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
11527𓀴of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
11528𓀴white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
11529𓀴champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw
11530𓀴his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned
11531𓀴and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,
11532𓀴and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
11533𓀴Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside
11534𓀴the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,
11535𓀴lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a
11536𓀴great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
11537𓀴under Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we
11538𓀴looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
11539𓀴open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved
11540𓀴forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
11541𓀴it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
11542𓀴seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a
11543𓀴few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was
11544𓀴ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
11545𓀴her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
11546𓀴blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her
11547𓀴poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
11548𓀴Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail
11549𓀴which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
11550𓀴endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
11551𓀴over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant
11552𓀴despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--
11553𓀴
11554𓀴“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can
11555𓀴do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
11556𓀴herself; I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
11557𓀴and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
11558𓀴holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
11559𓀴heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the
11560𓀴window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey
11561𓀴Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great
11562𓀴yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the
11563𓀴instant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partial
11564𓀴consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well
11565𓀴be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and
11566𓀴then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
11567𓀴started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
11568𓀴him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
11569𓀴however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
11570𓀴her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.
11571𓀴
11572𓀴“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr.
11573𓀴Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,
11574𓀴what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to
11575𓀴this!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly
11576𓀴together. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quick
11577𓀴movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
11578𓀴man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened?
11579𓀴Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you
11580𓀴love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
11581𓀴far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!” His wife, through her terror
11582𓀴and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
11583𓀴forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--
11584𓀴
11585𓀴“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
11586𓀴to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay
11587𓀴with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!” Her
11588𓀴expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she
11589𓀴pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.
11590𓀴
11591𓀴Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his
11592𓀴little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--
11593𓀴
11594𓀴“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no
11595𓀴foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
11596𓀴and take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down
11597𓀴her head on her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his white
11598𓀴night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
11599𓀴the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she
11600𓀴saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
11601𓀴sobs:--
11602𓀴
11603𓀴“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it
11604𓀴should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have
11605𓀴most cause to fear.” To this he spoke out resolutely:--
11606𓀴
11607𓀴“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not
11608𓀴hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my
11609𓀴deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
11610𓀴if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out
11611𓀴his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there
11612𓀴sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
11613𓀴damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a
11614𓀴while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to
11615𓀴me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous
11616𓀴power to the utmost:--
11617𓀴
11618𓀴“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad
11619𓀴fact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened,
11620𓀴and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
11621𓀴and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had
11622𓀴held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
11623𓀴the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to
11624𓀴see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
11625𓀴the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
11626𓀴hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
11627𓀴They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me
11628𓀴questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
11629𓀴their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
11630𓀴and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
11631𓀴to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
11632𓀴answered:--
11633𓀴
11634𓀴“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I
11635𓀴looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,
11636𓀴however----” He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
11637𓀴the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--
11638𓀴
11639𓀴“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now
11640𓀴is in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:--
11641𓀴
11642𓀴“He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few
11643𓀴seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
11644𓀴burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
11645𓀴cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
11646𓀴had helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is the
11647𓀴other copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he
11648𓀴went on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked
11649𓀴into Renfield’s room; but there was no trace there except----!” Again he
11650𓀴paused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and
11651𓀴moistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow
11652𓀴is dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
11653𓀴us she said solemnly:--
11654𓀴
11655𓀴“God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping back
11656𓀴something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
11657𓀴Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--
11658𓀴
11659𓀴“And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?”
11660𓀴
11661𓀴“A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually, but at present I
11662𓀴can’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would
11663𓀴go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from
11664𓀴Renfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some
11665𓀴shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He
11666𓀴will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
11667𓀴dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”
11668𓀴
11669𓀴He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps
11670𓀴a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could
11671𓀴hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his
11672𓀴hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker’s head:--
11673𓀴
11674𓀴“And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what
11675𓀴happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is
11676𓀴need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done
11677𓀴quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must
11678𓀴end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
11679𓀴learn.”
11680𓀴
11681𓀴The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
11682𓀴as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
11683𓀴lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held
11684𓀴out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
11685𓀴kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
11686𓀴of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
11687𓀴After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
11688𓀴began:--
11689𓀴
11690𓀴“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
11691𓀴long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
11692𓀴of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
11693𓀴connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”
11694𓀴Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
11695𓀴lovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me
11696𓀴through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me
11697𓀴to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I
11698𓀴need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work
11699𓀴with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to
11700𓀴sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no
11701𓀴more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
11702𓀴next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I
11703𓀴had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
11704𓀴it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
11705𓀴terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.
11706𓀴I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it
11707𓀴seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I
11708𓀴tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
11709𓀴looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
11710𓀴the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
11711𓀴had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
11712𓀴tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of
11713𓀴the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
11714𓀴fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
11715𓀴teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
11716𓀴sunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the
11717𓀴red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant
11718𓀴my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was
11719𓀴paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
11720𓀴pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--
11721𓀴
11722𓀴“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
11723𓀴before your very eyes.’ I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
11724𓀴say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
11725𓀴and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did
11726𓀴so, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well
11727𓀴be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
11728𓀴appeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not
11729𓀴want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that
11730𓀴such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity
11731𓀴me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groaned
11732𓀴again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
11733𓀴he were the injured one, and went on:--
11734𓀴
11735𓀴“I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long
11736𓀴this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time
11737𓀴must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I
11738𓀴saw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance seemed for a while to
11739𓀴overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
11740𓀴husband’s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
11741𓀴went on:--
11742𓀴
11743𓀴“Then he spoke to me mockingly, ‘And so you, like the others, would play
11744𓀴your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and
11745𓀴frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,
11746𓀴and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They
11747𓀴should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they
11748𓀴played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued
11749𓀴for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
11750𓀴born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now
11751𓀴to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
11752𓀴wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my
11753𓀴helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
11754𓀴minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you
11755𓀴have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
11756𓀴call. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea to
11757𓀴do my bidding; and to that end this!’ With that he pulled open his
11758𓀴shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
11759𓀴the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
11760𓀴them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
11761𓀴the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh
11762𓀴my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a
11763𓀴fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
11764𓀴days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
11765𓀴and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” Then she began to rub her
11766𓀴lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.
11767𓀴
11768𓀴As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
11769𓀴and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;
11770𓀴but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
11771𓀴which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
11772𓀴red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
11773𓀴against the whitening hair.
11774𓀴
11775𓀴We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
11776𓀴pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.
11777𓀴
11778𓀴Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in
11779𓀴all the great round of its daily course.

11787𓀴
11788𓀴
11789𓀴_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It
11790𓀴is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
11791𓀴take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
11792𓀴that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God
11793𓀴knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare
11794𓀴not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
11795𓀴the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could
11796𓀴not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,
11797𓀴we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears
11798𓀴running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
11799𓀴faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us
11800𓀴up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!
11801𓀴
11802𓀴When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor
11803𓀴Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward
11804𓀴told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
11805𓀴they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
11806𓀴all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.
11807𓀴
11808𓀴Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
11809𓀴heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to
11810𓀴half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
11811𓀴had called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that there
11812𓀴was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying
11813𓀴on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing
11814𓀴asked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could not
11815𓀴say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
11816𓀴there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
11817𓀴to it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr.
11818𓀴Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into
11819𓀴the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
11820𓀴would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As
11821𓀴it was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give a
11822𓀴certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
11823𓀴coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily
11824𓀴to the same result.
11825𓀴
11826𓀴When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
11827𓀴step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full
11828𓀴confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
11829𓀴kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
11830𓀴to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
11831𓀴despair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had
11832𓀴too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
11833𓀴give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!
11834𓀴Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”
11835𓀴Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
11836𓀴but quietly:--
11837𓀴
11838𓀴“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
11839𓀴others from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in its
11840𓀴lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
11841𓀴answered:--
11842𓀴
11843𓀴“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”
11844𓀴
11845𓀴“To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
11846𓀴our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer
11847𓀴came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--
11848𓀴
11849𓀴“Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
11850𓀴harm to any that I love, I shall die!”
11851𓀴
11852𓀴“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely.
11853𓀴
11854𓀴“I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a
11855𓀴pain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him meaningly as she
11856𓀴spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and
11857𓀴put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:
11858𓀴
11859𓀴“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I
11860𓀴could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,
11861𓀴even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my
11862𓀴child----” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his
11863𓀴throat; he gulped it down and went on:--
11864𓀴
11865𓀴“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not
11866𓀴die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until
11867𓀴the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
11868𓀴die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make
11869𓀴you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to
11870𓀴live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
11871𓀴himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
11872𓀴night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you
11873𓀴do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” The
11874𓀴poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a
11875𓀴quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all
11876𓀴silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to
11877𓀴him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--
11878𓀴
11879𓀴“I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
11880𓀴strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
11881𓀴have passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all felt
11882𓀴that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
11883𓀴began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all
11884𓀴the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
11885𓀴might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
11886𓀴She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” could
11887𓀴be used in connection with so grim an interest.
11888𓀴
11889𓀴As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
11890𓀴prepared with an exact ordering of our work.
11891𓀴
11892𓀴“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to
11893𓀴Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
11894𓀴there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and
11895𓀴would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
11896𓀴effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our
11897𓀴intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a
11898𓀴power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use
11899𓀴them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
11900𓀴to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
11901𓀴Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;
11902𓀴and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
11903𓀴guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must
11904𓀴retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations
11905𓀴of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
11906𓀴through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
11907𓀴must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out
11908𓀴all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch
11909𓀴him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
11910𓀴and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I
11911𓀴could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
11912𓀴preciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,
11913𓀴since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up
11914𓀴his hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the
11915𓀴quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all
11916𓀴act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in
11917𓀴all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.
11918𓀴The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have
11919𓀴deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he
11920𓀴write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
11921𓀴that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
11922𓀴where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
11923𓀴very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and
11924𓀴search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
11925𓀴friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we
11926𓀴run down our old fox--so? is it not?”
11927𓀴
11928𓀴“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious,
11929𓀴precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:--
11930𓀴
11931𓀴“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”
11932𓀴
11933𓀴“Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.”
11934𓀴
11935𓀴“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”
11936𓀴
11937𓀴I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good
11938𓀴reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--
11939𓀴
11940𓀴“Don’t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am
11941𓀴in.”
11942𓀴
11943𓀴“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to
11944𓀴your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
11945𓀴movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it
11946𓀴seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
11947𓀴into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I nodded.
11948𓀴
11949𓀴“Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
11950𓀴not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the
11951𓀴housebreaker, what would you do?”
11952𓀴
11953𓀴“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
11954𓀴lock for me.”
11955𓀴
11956𓀴“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”
11957𓀴
11958𓀴“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”
11959𓀴
11960𓀴“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in doubt is
11961𓀴the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
11962𓀴whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your
11963𓀴police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
11964𓀴the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my
11965𓀴friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this
11966𓀴your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
11967𓀴things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
11968𓀴no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
11969𓀴house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland
11970𓀴and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
11971𓀴got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
11972𓀴and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he
11973𓀴have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
11974𓀴and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
11975𓀴that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him
11976𓀴that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away
11977𓀴within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all
11978𓀴they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
11979𓀴he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done
11980𓀴_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go
11981𓀴so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
11982𓀴it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many
11983𓀴about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
11984𓀴house.”
11985𓀴
11986𓀴I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina’s
11987𓀴face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van
11988𓀴Helsing went on:--
11989𓀴
11990𓀴“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
11991𓀴us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
11992𓀴more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.”
11993𓀴
11994𓀴Lord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,” he said. “I shall
11995𓀴wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
11996𓀴convenient.”
11997𓀴
11998𓀴“Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have all
11999𓀴ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one
12000𓀴of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of
12001𓀴Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?
12002𓀴It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
12003𓀴even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”
12004𓀴
12005𓀴“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “His head is what you
12006𓀴call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
12007𓀴do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.”
12008𓀴
12009𓀴Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see
12010𓀴that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the
12011𓀴terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost
12012𓀴ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
12013𓀴somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give
12014𓀴her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
12015𓀴what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As
12016𓀴yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
12017𓀴was short, and there was time for fear.
12018𓀴
12019𓀴When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
12020𓀴disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was
12021𓀴finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the
12022𓀴Count’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we
12023𓀴should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
12024𓀴presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
12025𓀴some new clue.
12026𓀴
12027𓀴As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
12028𓀴after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
12029𓀴that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming
12030𓀴and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
12031𓀴It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
12032𓀴might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
12033𓀴able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to
12034𓀴follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as
12035𓀴my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect
12036𓀴Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would
12037𓀴not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter
12038𓀴in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might be
12039𓀴some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;
12040𓀴and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
12041𓀴cope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’s
12042𓀴resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
12043𓀴we should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear.
12044𓀴Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
12045𓀴have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if
12046𓀴He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So I
12047𓀴started up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for we
12048𓀴are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we
12049𓀴think.”
12050𓀴
12051𓀴“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.
12052𓀴
12053𓀴“But why?” I asked.
12054𓀴
12055𓀴“Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night he
12056𓀴banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”
12057𓀴
12058𓀴Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that
12059𓀴terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
12060𓀴the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
12061𓀴shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
12062𓀴frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in
12063𓀴the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,
12064𓀴he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh,
12065𓀴Madam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so
12066𓀴reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old
12067𓀴lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
12068𓀴forget it, will you not?” He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took
12069𓀴his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--
12070𓀴
12071𓀴“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
12072𓀴have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
12073𓀴together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we
12074𓀴must all eat that we may be strong.”
12075𓀴
12076𓀴Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
12077𓀴encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
12078𓀴us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--
12079𓀴
12080𓀴“Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we
12081𓀴all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s
12082𓀴lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all assured
12083𓀴him. “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
12084𓀴here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall
12085𓀴return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I
12086𓀴have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
12087𓀴of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
12088𓀴yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the
12089𓀴name of the Father, the Son, and----”
12090𓀴
12091𓀴There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he
12092𓀴had placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burned
12093𓀴into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor
12094𓀴darling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
12095𓀴her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
12096𓀴her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the
12097𓀴words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
12098𓀴to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
12099𓀴knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
12100𓀴over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--
12101𓀴
12102𓀴“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must
12103𓀴bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.” They
12104𓀴all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
12105𓀴grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our
12106𓀴sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
12107𓀴their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said
12108𓀴gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
12109𓀴way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--
12110𓀴
12111𓀴“It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,
12112𓀴as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of
12113𓀴the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam
12114𓀴Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
12115𓀴red scar, the sign of God’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
12116𓀴and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as
12117𓀴we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the
12118𓀴burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
12119𓀴in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of
12120𓀴His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
12121𓀴through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
12122𓀴fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.”
12123𓀴
12124𓀴There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
12125𓀴Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
12126𓀴man’s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all
12127𓀴knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
12128𓀴other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
12129𓀴head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
12130𓀴and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.
12131𓀴
12132𓀴It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which
12133𓀴neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.
12134𓀴
12135𓀴To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a
12136𓀴vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
12137𓀴land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
12138𓀴many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
12139𓀴the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.
12140𓀴
12141𓀴We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
12142𓀴the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
12143𓀴surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
12144𓀴fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there
12145𓀴not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
12146𓀴with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
12147𓀴in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
12148𓀴Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--
12149𓀴
12150𓀴“And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this
12151𓀴earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far
12152𓀴distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has
12153𓀴been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
12154𓀴holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
12155𓀴God.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and
12156𓀴very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled
12157𓀴musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
12158𓀴was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the
12159𓀴Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
12160𓀴the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.
12161𓀴
12162𓀴One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
12163𓀴them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion
12164𓀴of the Host.
12165𓀴
12166𓀴When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--
12167𓀴
12168𓀴“So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can
12169𓀴be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam
12170𓀴Mina’s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”
12171𓀴
12172𓀴As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
12173𓀴train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the
12174𓀴window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to
12175𓀴tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in
12176𓀴reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
12177𓀴hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station
12178𓀴and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
12179𓀴platform.
12180𓀴
12181𓀴I have written this in the train.
12182𓀴
12183𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
12184𓀴
12185𓀴_Piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
12186𓀴Lord Godalming said to me:--
12187𓀴
12188𓀴“Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
12189𓀴case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
12190𓀴wouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a
12191𓀴solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
12192𓀴should have known better.” I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
12193𓀴even of odium, but he went on: “Besides, it will attract less attention
12194𓀴if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with
12195𓀴the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had
12196𓀴better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,
12197𓀴somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
12198𓀴the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the
12199𓀴lookout for you, and shall let you in.”
12200𓀴
12201𓀴“The advice is good!” said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming
12202𓀴and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner
12203𓀴of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green
12204𓀴Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was
12205𓀴centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
12206𓀴its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench
12207𓀴within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
12208𓀴attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
12209𓀴waited for the coming of the others.
12210𓀴
12211𓀴At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
12212𓀴fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended
12213𓀴a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid
12214𓀴the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two
12215𓀴ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
12216𓀴The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
12217𓀴of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered
12218𓀴along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
12219𓀴placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a
12220𓀴selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly
12221𓀴fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
12222𓀴turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and
12223𓀴the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
12224𓀴began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling
12225𓀴about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the
12226𓀴door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others
12227𓀴entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
12228𓀴Helsing’s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the
12229𓀴workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
12230𓀴open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.
12231𓀴This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and
12232𓀴gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
12233𓀴coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
12234𓀴transaction.
12235𓀴
12236𓀴When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
12237𓀴the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood
12238𓀴Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.
12239𓀴
12240𓀴“The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. It did
12241𓀴indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our
12242𓀴previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the
12243𓀴place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together
12244𓀴in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
12245𓀴with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the
12246𓀴house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
12247𓀴eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
12248𓀴Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
12249𓀴missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
12250𓀴across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
12251𓀴pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no
12252𓀴windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not
12253𓀴lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had
12254𓀴brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
12255𓀴treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the
12256𓀴Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
12257𓀴any of his effects.
12258𓀴
12259𓀴After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
12260𓀴we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
12261𓀴which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
12262𓀴them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
12263𓀴table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;
12264𓀴deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;
12265𓀴note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin
12266𓀴wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
12267𓀴brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing
12268𓀴dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a
12269𓀴little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
12270𓀴the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming
12271𓀴and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
12272𓀴houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
12273𓀴bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us
12274𓀴are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
12275𓀴the Count.

12280𓀴CHAPTER XXIII
12281𓀴
12282𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
12283𓀴
12284𓀴
12285𓀴_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
12286𓀴the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep
12287𓀴our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
12288𓀴purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
12289𓀴The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
12290𓀴Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
12291𓀴face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,
12292𓀴haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
12293𓀴eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in
12294𓀴fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if
12295𓀴all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,
12296𓀴in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I
12297𓀴thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows
12298𓀴this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he
12299𓀴has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So
12300𓀴well as I can remember, here it is:--
12301𓀴
12302𓀴“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
12303𓀴the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the
12304𓀴greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there
12305𓀴are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
12306𓀴it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,
12307𓀴he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and
12308𓀴alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
12309𓀴science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond
12310𓀴compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to
12311𓀴attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time
12312𓀴that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the
12313𓀴physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
12314𓀴In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
12315𓀴growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
12316𓀴man’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
12317𓀴been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we
12318𓀴fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
12319𓀴lead through Death, not Life.”
12320𓀴
12321𓀴Harker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my darling!
12322𓀴But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!”
12323𓀴
12324𓀴“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
12325𓀴surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
12326𓀴yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
12327𓀴things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means
12328𓀴to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
12329𓀴and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.”
12330𓀴
12331𓀴“I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, do be more plain to
12332𓀴me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”
12333𓀴
12334𓀴The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--
12335𓀴
12336𓀴“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
12337𓀴monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been
12338𓀴making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend
12339𓀴John’s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when
12340𓀴and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
12341𓀴an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not
12342𓀴see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He
12343𓀴knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
12344𓀴child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he
12345𓀴might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he
12346𓀴found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he
12347𓀴progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where
12348𓀴they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
12349𓀴that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
12350𓀴form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
12351𓀴hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
12352𓀴just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
12353𓀴and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he
12354𓀴can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is
12355𓀴there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even
12356𓀴more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
12357𓀴well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our
12358𓀴day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are
12359𓀴five of us when those absent ones return.”
12360𓀴
12361𓀴Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the
12362𓀴double postman’s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the
12363𓀴hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
12364𓀴keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a
12365𓀴despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
12366𓀴direction, opened it and read aloud.
12367𓀴
12368𓀴“Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
12369𓀴hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
12370𓀴to see you: Mina.”
12371𓀴
12372𓀴There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker’s voice:--
12373𓀴
12374𓀴“Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned to him
12375𓀴quickly and said:--
12376𓀴
12377𓀴“God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
12378𓀴as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.”
12379𓀴
12380𓀴“I care for nothing now,” he answered hotly, “except to wipe out this
12381𓀴brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!”
12382𓀴
12383𓀴“Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not purchase
12384𓀴souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
12385𓀴faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
12386𓀴devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
12387𓀴doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are
12388𓀴all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is
12389𓀴coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
12390𓀴and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive
12391𓀴here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
12392𓀴before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for
12393𓀴is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.”
12394𓀴
12395𓀴About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, there
12396𓀴came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary
12397𓀴knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
12398𓀴the Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
12399𓀴together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
12400𓀴armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van
12401𓀴Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
12402𓀴back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
12403𓀴must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
12404𓀴saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed
12405𓀴the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
12406𓀴hall:--
12407𓀴
12408𓀴“It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
12409𓀴destroyed them all!”
12410𓀴
12411𓀴“Destroyed?” asked the Professor.
12412𓀴
12413𓀴“For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--
12414𓀴
12415𓀴“There’s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn’t turn up
12416𓀴by five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave Mrs. Harker
12417𓀴alone after sunset.”
12418𓀴
12419𓀴“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had been
12420𓀴consulting his pocket-book. “_Nota bene_, in Madam’s telegram he went
12421𓀴south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could
12422𓀴only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
12423𓀴o’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only
12424𓀴suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would
12425𓀴suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a
12426𓀴short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to
12427𓀴Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be
12428𓀴carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not
12429𓀴have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that
12430𓀴we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your
12431𓀴arms! Be ready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could
12432𓀴hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.
12433𓀴
12434𓀴I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
12435𓀴dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
12436𓀴adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
12437𓀴been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
12438𓀴accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
12439𓀴renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
12440𓀴laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
12441𓀴gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
12442𓀴just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
12443𓀴guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
12444𓀴Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
12445𓀴move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
12446𓀴seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
12447𓀴the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
12448𓀴he feared it.
12449𓀴
12450𓀴Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
12451𓀴us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
12452𓀴so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
12453𓀴to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was
12454𓀴Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
12455𓀴leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a
12456𓀴horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
12457𓀴and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
12458𓀴lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single
12459𓀴impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
12460𓀴better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what
12461𓀴we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
12462𓀴avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
12463𓀴ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The
12464𓀴blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s
12465𓀴leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
12466𓀴through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
12467𓀴making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold
12468𓀴fell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a
12469𓀴moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife
12470𓀴aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a
12471𓀴protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
12472𓀴felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I
12473𓀴saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously
12474𓀴by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of
12475𓀴hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
12476𓀴the Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
12477𓀴of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
12478𓀴pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous
12479𓀴dive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
12480𓀴a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
12481𓀴himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
12482𓀴he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the
12483𓀴shivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the
12484𓀴sovereigns fell on the flagging.
12485𓀴
12486𓀴We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
12487𓀴the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
12488𓀴There he turned and spoke to us:--
12489𓀴
12490𓀴“You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like
12491𓀴sheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think
12492𓀴you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is
12493𓀴just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
12494𓀴girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
12495𓀴others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
12496𓀴jackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passed
12497𓀴quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
12498𓀴fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us
12499𓀴to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
12500𓀴him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.
12501𓀴
12502𓀴“We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he
12503𓀴fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His
12504𓀴very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You
12505𓀴follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For
12506𓀴me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
12507𓀴return.” As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took
12508𓀴the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the
12509𓀴remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with
12510𓀴a match.
12511𓀴
12512𓀴Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had
12513𓀴lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,
12514𓀴bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
12515𓀴was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back
12516𓀴of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.
12517𓀴
12518𓀴It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to
12519𓀴recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
12520𓀴Professor when he said:--
12521𓀴
12522𓀴“Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do
12523𓀴just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need
12524𓀴not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
12525𓀴it; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke as
12526𓀴bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken
12527𓀴down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he
12528𓀴was thinking of his wife.
12529𓀴
12530𓀴With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker
12531𓀴waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
12532𓀴bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as
12533𓀴pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
12534𓀴in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--
12535𓀴
12536𓀴“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke,
12537𓀴she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“Lay your
12538𓀴poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect
12539𓀴us if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor fellow groaned. There
12540𓀴was no place for words in his sublime misery.
12541𓀴
12542𓀴We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us
12543𓀴all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
12544𓀴people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
12545𓀴of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
12546𓀴miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to
12547𓀴our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and
12548𓀴although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
12549𓀴threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
12550𓀴manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the
12551𓀴part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
12552𓀴her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
12553𓀴protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,
12554𓀴till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
12555𓀴to the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she
12556𓀴stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
12557𓀴scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
12558𓀴of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
12559𓀴she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
12560𓀴teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
12561𓀴our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
12562𓀴we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
12563𓀴purity and faith, was outcast from God.
12564𓀴
12565𓀴“Jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
12566𓀴so full of love and tenderness, “Jonathan dear, and you all my true,
12567𓀴true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this
12568𓀴dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
12569𓀴you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;
12570𓀴but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this
12571𓀴misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when
12572𓀴he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
12573𓀴spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
12574𓀴not hold your hands from his destruction.”
12575𓀴
12576𓀴As she spoke I could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, as
12577𓀴though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
12578𓀴Instinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till his
12579𓀴knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she
12580𓀴must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
12581𓀴than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing
12582𓀴his hand from hers as he spoke:--
12583𓀴
12584𓀴“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
12585𓀴earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send
12586𓀴his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”
12587𓀴
12588𓀴“Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don’t say such things,
12589𓀴Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just
12590𓀴think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
12591𓀴... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some
12592𓀴other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,
12593𓀴my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought
12594𓀴had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured
12595𓀴your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and
12596𓀴sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
12597𓀴of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom
12598𓀴so many sorrows have come.”
12599𓀴
12600𓀴We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept
12601𓀴openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
12602𓀴Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
12603𓀴round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned
12604𓀴to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
12605𓀴with their God.
12606𓀴
12607𓀴Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming
12608𓀴of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.
12609𓀴She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
12610𓀴husband’s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,
12611𓀴I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at
12612𓀴hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
12613𓀴When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should
12614𓀴sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
12615𓀴poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
12616𓀴shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,
12617𓀴for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go
12618𓀴to bed.
12619𓀴
12620𓀴
12621𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
12622𓀴
12623𓀴_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.
12624𓀴There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
12625𓀴that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
12626𓀴now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
12627𓀴was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one
12628𓀴earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he
12629𓀴chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the
12630𓀴meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.
12631𓀴This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that
12632𓀴one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her
12633𓀴sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster
12634𓀴seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
12635𓀴by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting
12636𓀴reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is
12637𓀴sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be
12638𓀴like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so
12639𓀴calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came
12640𓀴over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
12641𓀴I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
12642𓀴face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
12643𓀴myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;
12644𓀴for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
12645𓀴until....
12646𓀴
12647𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
12648𓀴
12649𓀴_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was
12650𓀴sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,
12651𓀴for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand
12652𓀴over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--
12653𓀴
12654𓀴“Hush! there is someone in the corridor!” I got up softly, and crossing
12655𓀴the room, gently opened the door.
12656𓀴
12657𓀴Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He
12658𓀴raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--
12659𓀴
12660𓀴“Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
12661𓀴night. We don’t mean to take any chances!”
12662𓀴
12663𓀴His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
12664𓀴She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale
12665𓀴face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--
12666𓀴
12667𓀴“Oh, thank God for good brave men!” With a sigh she sank back again to
12668𓀴sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.
12669𓀴

12671𓀴
12672𓀴_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by
12673𓀴Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming
12674𓀴dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
12675𓀴like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--
12676𓀴
12677𓀴“Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.”
12678𓀴
12679𓀴“Why?” I asked.
12680𓀴
12681𓀴“I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
12682𓀴without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I
12683𓀴shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” I
12684𓀴went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
12685𓀴me, he sprang to his feet.
12686𓀴
12687𓀴“Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm.
12688𓀴
12689𓀴“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.”
12690𓀴
12691𓀴“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’s room.
12692𓀴
12693𓀴In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
12694𓀴dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
12695𓀴the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a
12696𓀴positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he
12697𓀴said:--
12698𓀴
12699𓀴“Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,
12700𓀴we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” Then
12701𓀴turning to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do for you? For at
12702𓀴this hour you do not want me for nothings.”
12703𓀴
12704𓀴“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn, for I
12705𓀴feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is
12706𓀴short!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.
12707𓀴
12708𓀴Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
12709𓀴from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina
12710𓀴gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat
12711𓀴like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually
12712𓀴her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
12713𓀴her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few
12714𓀴more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was
12715𓀴covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she
12716𓀴did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and
12717𓀴her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to
12718𓀴impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
12719𓀴They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
12720𓀴foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The
12721𓀴stillness was broken by Van Helsing’s voice speaking in a low level tone
12722𓀴which would not break the current of her thoughts:--
12723𓀴
12724𓀴“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:--
12725𓀴
12726𓀴“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several
12727𓀴minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
12728𓀴staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room
12729𓀴was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. Van
12730𓀴Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
12731𓀴just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse
12732𓀴itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--
12733𓀴
12734𓀴“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
12735𓀴were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the
12736𓀴same tone when reading her shorthand notes.
12737𓀴
12738𓀴“I do not know. It is all strange to me!”
12739𓀴
12740𓀴“What do you see?”
12741𓀴
12742𓀴“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”
12743𓀴
12744𓀴“What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in the Professor’s patient
12745𓀴voice.
12746𓀴
12747𓀴“The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
12748𓀴hear them on the outside.”
12749𓀴
12750𓀴“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other, trying to glean
12751𓀴something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came
12752𓀴quick:--
12753𓀴
12754𓀴“Oh, yes!”
12755𓀴
12756𓀴“What else do you hear?”
12757𓀴
12758𓀴“The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the
12759𓀴creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
12760𓀴falls into the rachet.”
12761𓀴
12762𓀴“What are you doing?”
12763𓀴
12764𓀴“I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!” The voice faded away into
12765𓀴a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.
12766𓀴
12767𓀴By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
12768𓀴day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’s shoulders, and laid her
12769𓀴head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few
12770𓀴moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
12771𓀴us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.
12772𓀴She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
12773𓀴was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
12774𓀴conversation, and she said:--
12775𓀴
12776𓀴“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr.
12777𓀴Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calm
12778𓀴voice called them back:--
12779𓀴
12780𓀴“Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
12781𓀴whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
12782𓀴your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be
12783𓀴thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
12784𓀴know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
12785𓀴since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
12786𓀴forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
12787𓀴that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
12788𓀴Count’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce
12789𓀴knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear
12790𓀴me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men
12791𓀴following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He
12792𓀴have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He
12793𓀴think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would
12794𓀴say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
12795𓀴we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
12796𓀴little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
12797𓀴between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he
12798𓀴would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
12799𓀴slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
12800𓀴us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
12801𓀴and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with
12802𓀴us.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--
12803𓀴
12804𓀴“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” He
12805𓀴took her hand and patted it as he replied:--
12806𓀴
12807𓀴“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
12808𓀴questions.” He would say no more, and we separated to dress.
12809𓀴
12810𓀴After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for
12811𓀴a minute and then said sorrowfully:--
12812𓀴
12813𓀴“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him
12814𓀴even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!” She grew paler as
12815𓀴she asked faintly:--
12816𓀴
12817𓀴“Why?”
12818𓀴
12819𓀴“Because,” he answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you are
12820𓀴but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark
12821𓀴upon your throat.”
12822𓀴
12823𓀴I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.

12833𓀴This to Jonathan Harker.
12834𓀴
12835𓀴You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our
12836𓀴search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
12837𓀴seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.
12838𓀴This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him
12839𓀴here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
12840𓀴for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back
12841𓀴to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of
12842𓀴fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and
12843𓀴that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the
12844𓀴money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
12845𓀴go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that
12846𓀴he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
12847𓀴But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last
12848𓀴resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.
12849𓀴He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and
12850𓀴so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,
12851𓀴and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
12852𓀴when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will
12853𓀴comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope
12854𓀴when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we
12855𓀴pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in
12856𓀴one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
12857𓀴finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
12858𓀴But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
12859𓀴together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is
12860𓀴but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high
12861𓀴to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.

12868𓀴_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing’s message in the
12869𓀴phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the
12870𓀴certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
12871𓀴and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
12872𓀴danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
12873𓀴believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
12874𓀴like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
12875𓀴sunlight----
12876𓀴
12877𓀴Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on
12878𓀴the red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. Whilst that lasts,
12879𓀴there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will
12880𓀴keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been
12881𓀴over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality
12882𓀴seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is
12883𓀴something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
12884𓀴Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may
12885𓀴be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other
12886𓀴yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and
12887𓀴the others after their investigations.
12888𓀴
12889𓀴The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run

12895𓀴_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
12896𓀴Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
12897𓀴Harker, Mina Harker.
12898𓀴
12899𓀴Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
12900𓀴discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--
12901𓀴
12902𓀴“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
12903𓀴he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
12904𓀴by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
12905𓀴ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
12906𓀴ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
12907𓀴Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
12908𓀴your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
12909𓀴Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,
12910𓀴however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go
12911𓀴out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
12912𓀴Doolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
12913𓀴Danube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off
12914𓀴we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
12915𓀴so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire
12916𓀴of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
12917𓀴and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
12918𓀴give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
12919𓀴put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he
12920𓀴still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask
12921𓀴many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
12922𓀴have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of
12923𓀴others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but
12924𓀴nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.
12925𓀴
12926𓀴“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
12927𓀴o’clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
12928𓀴and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in
12929𓀴black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
12930𓀴time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
12931𓀴sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
12932𓀴then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
12933𓀴gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when
12934𓀴told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he
12935𓀴agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
12936𓀴and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
12937𓀴driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it
12938𓀴take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to
12939𓀴captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
12940𓀴it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he
12941𓀴can come and see where it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not
12942𓀴yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he
12943𓀴had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
12944𓀴place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin
12945𓀴man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he
12946𓀴will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,
12947𓀴polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
12948𓀴will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
12949𓀴sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
12950𓀴him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
12951𓀴with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking
12952𓀴where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship
12953𓀴forms, he departed.
12954𓀴
12955𓀴“No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for
12956𓀴they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
12957𓀴became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as
12958𓀴was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
12959𓀴and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
12960𓀴The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
12961𓀴blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to
12962𓀴fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,
12963𓀴when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
12964𓀴asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied
12965𓀴that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and
12966𓀴blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
12967𓀴with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
12968𓀴on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
12969𓀴Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
12970𓀴all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was
12971𓀴of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears
12972𓀴exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
12973𓀴picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
12974𓀴and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any
12975𓀴of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship
12976𓀴went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
12977𓀴river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.
12978𓀴
12979𓀴“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for
12980𓀴our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
12981𓀴Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
12982𓀴we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope
12983𓀴is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
12984𓀴he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There
12985𓀴are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about
12986𓀴where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
12987𓀴invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in
12988𓀴Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
12989𓀴his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
12990𓀴When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
12991𓀴have inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not
12992𓀴for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own
12993𓀴way.”
12994𓀴
12995𓀴When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain
12996𓀴that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have the
12997𓀴best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
12998𓀴morning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
12999𓀴pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that
13000𓀴he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,
13001𓀴at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more
13002𓀴forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
13003𓀴of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
13004𓀴men:--
13005𓀴
13006𓀴“Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,
13007𓀴and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm
13008𓀴already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short
13009𓀴time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in
13010𓀴darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my
13011𓀴dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or
13012𓀴in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his
13013𓀴own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life
13014𓀴of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
13015𓀴work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do
13016𓀴what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
13017𓀴been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of
13018𓀴nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
13019𓀴some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for
13020𓀴all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
13021𓀴world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
13022𓀴There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
13023𓀴of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,
13024𓀴there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
13025𓀴occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
13026𓀴himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike
13027𓀴time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
13028𓀴more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in
13029𓀴strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
13030𓀴thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
13031𓀴is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
13032𓀴and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have
13033𓀴infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for
13034𓀴good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do
13035𓀴no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
13036𓀴so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction,
13037𓀴shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
13038𓀴that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the
13039𓀴world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
13040𓀴whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
13041𓀴soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
13042𓀴more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
13043𓀴we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:--
13044𓀴
13045𓀴“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
13046𓀴from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
13047𓀴which he has been hunted?”
13048𓀴
13049𓀴“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
13050𓀴adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once
13051𓀴tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl
13052𓀴unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a
13053𓀴tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he
13054𓀴is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
13055𓀴over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be
13056𓀴beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
13057𓀴Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to
13058𓀴him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What
13059𓀴does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for
13060𓀴him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He
13061𓀴find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He
13062𓀴study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old
13063𓀴ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
13064𓀴land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that
13065𓀴he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help
13066𓀴him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at
13067𓀴the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a
13068𓀴ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
13069𓀴world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know
13070𓀴him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
13071𓀴peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,
13072𓀴what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we
13073𓀴are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our
13074𓀴efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
13075𓀴even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
13076𓀴strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
13077𓀴to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
13078𓀴for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
13079𓀴honour and glory of God.”
13080𓀴
13081𓀴After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
13082𓀴be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
13083𓀴think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
13084𓀴meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
13085𓀴shall decide on some definite cause of action.

13088𓀴
13089𓀴I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting
13090𓀴presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...
13091𓀴
13092𓀴My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the
13093𓀴mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still
13094𓀴unclean.
13095𓀴
13096𓀴
13097𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
13098𓀴
13099𓀴_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for
13100𓀴each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
13101𓀴general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
13102𓀴again.
13103𓀴
13104𓀴It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
13105𓀴any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by
13106𓀴death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More
13107𓀴than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
13108𓀴the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
13109𓀴caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was
13110𓀴brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the
13111𓀴matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
13112𓀴trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her
13113𓀴trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
13114𓀴recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to
13115𓀴meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
13116𓀴action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct
13117𓀴rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
13118𓀴that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I _know_
13119𓀴that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can
13120𓀴guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
13121𓀴cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and
13122𓀴he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of
13123𓀴that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
13124𓀴Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the
13125𓀴Vampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils
13126𓀴itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
13127𓀴a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my
13128𓀴instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a
13129𓀴terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same
13130𓀴power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think
13131𓀴further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!
13132𓀴
13133𓀴Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
13134𓀴try to open the subject with him.

13137𓀴
13138𓀴_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
13139𓀴things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to
13140𓀴say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
13141𓀴about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--
13142𓀴
13143𓀴“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just
13144𓀴at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our
13145𓀴confidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--
13146𓀴
13147𓀴“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran
13148𓀴through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
13149𓀴continued:--
13150𓀴
13151𓀴“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
13152𓀴before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than
13153𓀴ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I
13154𓀴can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now
13155𓀴but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
13156𓀴without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
13157𓀴are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now
13158𓀴often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she
13159𓀴wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If
13160𓀴it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and
13161𓀴hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who
13162𓀴have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
13163𓀴will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded
13164𓀴acquiescence; he went on:--
13165𓀴
13166𓀴“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
13167𓀴our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful
13168𓀴task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.
13169𓀴When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not
13170𓀴to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
13171𓀴us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
13172𓀴at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
13173𓀴soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort
13174𓀴to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at
13175𓀴any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the
13176𓀴effect was as I expected.
13177𓀴
13178𓀴It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
13179𓀴gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I
13180𓀴really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.
13181𓀴
13182𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
13183𓀴
13184𓀴_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
13185𓀴experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
13186𓀴message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
13187𓀴she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
13188𓀴without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
13189𓀴other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own
13190𓀴part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
13191𓀴much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we
13192𓀴agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
13193𓀴preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
13194𓀴confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
13195𓀴Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--
13196𓀴
13197𓀴“The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
13198𓀴her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
13199𓀴reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
13200𓀴Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such
13201𓀴weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
13202𓀴we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
13203𓀴then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite
13204𓀴safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate
13205𓀴be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
13206𓀴preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed
13207𓀴against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris
13208𓀴added:--
13209𓀴
13210𓀴“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
13211𓀴that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
13212𓀴our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
13213𓀴trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
13214𓀴after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeater
13215𓀴apiece!”
13216𓀴
13217𓀴“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’s head is
13218𓀴level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
13219𓀴dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we
13220𓀴can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of
13221𓀴us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
13222𓀴To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
13223𓀴four can set out on our journey.”
13224𓀴
13225𓀴“We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
13226𓀴us.
13227𓀴
13228𓀴“Of course!” answered the Professor quickly, “you must remain to take
13229𓀴care of your so sweet wife!” Harker was silent for awhile and then said
13230𓀴in a hollow voice:--
13231𓀴
13232𓀴“Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
13233𓀴Mina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not
13234𓀴to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him
13235𓀴significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and
13236𓀴turned away.

13239𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
13240𓀴
13241𓀴_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I
13242𓀴could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of
13243𓀴wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination not
13244𓀴to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not
13245𓀴argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from
13246𓀴a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
13247𓀴last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
13248𓀴more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
13249𓀴and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams
13250𓀴with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.
13251𓀴
13252𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
13253𓀴
13254𓀴_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’s happy sleep, and
13255𓀴came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the
13256𓀴evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
13257𓀴lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at
13258𓀴once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--
13259𓀴
13260𓀴“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A
13261𓀴promise made to me, but made holily in God’s hearing, and not to be
13262𓀴broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
13263𓀴tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.”
13264𓀴
13265𓀴“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have
13266𓀴no right to make it.”
13267𓀴
13268𓀴“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
13269𓀴were like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.
13270𓀴You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may
13271𓀴do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
13272𓀴from the promise.”
13273𓀴
13274𓀴“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though
13275𓀴to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
13276𓀴She said:--
13277𓀴
13278𓀴“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for
13279𓀴the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or
13280𓀴implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she
13281𓀴solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said
13282𓀴solemnly:--
13283𓀴
13284𓀴“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
13285𓀴been shut between us.
13286𓀴

13288𓀴
13289𓀴_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
13290𓀴So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
13291𓀴somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall
13292𓀴of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired
13293𓀴early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing
13294𓀴that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
13295𓀴trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
13296𓀴Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall
13297𓀴try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.

13300𓀴
13301𓀴_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
13302𓀴same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
13303𓀴that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
13304𓀴for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
13305𓀴him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the
13306𓀴opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the
13307𓀴room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.
13308𓀴
13309𓀴“No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. You can tell
13310𓀴them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.”
13311𓀴
13312𓀴Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’s pause he
13313𓀴asked:--
13314𓀴
13315𓀴“But why?”
13316𓀴
13317𓀴“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
13318𓀴too.”
13319𓀴
13320𓀴“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest
13321𓀴duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
13322𓀴any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” He paused,
13323𓀴embarrassed.
13324𓀴
13325𓀴As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--
13326𓀴
13327𓀴“I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is
13328𓀴coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me
13329𓀴I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by
13330𓀴wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.” God saw the look that
13331𓀴she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
13332𓀴that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her
13333𓀴hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
13334𓀴tears. She went on:--
13335𓀴
13336𓀴“You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you
13337𓀴can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
13338𓀴to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
13339𓀴and so learn that which even I myself do not know.” Dr. Van Helsing said
13340𓀴very gravely:--
13341𓀴
13342𓀴“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and
13343𓀴together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he had
13344𓀴spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen
13345𓀴back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up
13346𓀴the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing
13347𓀴motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within
13348𓀴a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
13349𓀴He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--
13350𓀴
13351𓀴“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a
13352𓀴new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony
13353𓀴to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
13354𓀴warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be
13355𓀴ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”
13356𓀴
13357𓀴“What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor
13358𓀴paused before replying:--
13359𓀴
13360𓀴“We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
13361𓀴the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall
13362𓀴fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
13363𓀴superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
13364𓀴man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,
13365𓀴when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
13366𓀴shall open the box, and--and all will be well.”
13367𓀴
13368𓀴“I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris. “When I see the box
13369𓀴I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
13370𓀴men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” I
13371𓀴grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
13372𓀴I think he understood my look; I hope he did.
13373𓀴
13374𓀴“Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God
13375𓀴bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or
13376𓀴pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,
13377𓀴indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things
13378𓀴which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
13379𓀴until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and
13380𓀴when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now
13381𓀴let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
13382𓀴on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
13383𓀴can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own
13384𓀴affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
13385𓀴arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
13386𓀴our journey.”
13387𓀴
13388𓀴There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle
13389𓀴up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....

13393𓀴_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she
13394𓀴survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
13395𓀴have been so good to us shall have remainder.
13396𓀴
13397𓀴It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’s uneasiness calls my
13398𓀴attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the
13399𓀴time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing
13400𓀴times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
13401𓀴danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God’s will be means to a
13402𓀴good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must
13403𓀴not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
13404𓀴shall be ready.
13405𓀴
13406𓀴She is calling to me.

13412𓀴
13413𓀴DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
13414𓀴
13415𓀴
13416𓀴_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
13417𓀴says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.
13418𓀴
13419𓀴I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
13420𓀴Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
13421𓀴understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
13422𓀴when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
13423𓀴or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
13424𓀴begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
13425𓀴till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
13426𓀴the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
13427𓀴negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
13428𓀴freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
13429𓀴change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of
13430𓀴warning silence.
13431𓀴
13432𓀴To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
13433𓀴signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
13434𓀴violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
13435𓀴minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
13436𓀴her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
13437𓀴she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s hand
13438𓀴in hers began:--
13439𓀴
13440𓀴“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
13441𓀴dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.” This was to
13442𓀴her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “In
13443𓀴the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in
13444𓀴store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
13445𓀴with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
13446𓀴woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
13447𓀴at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
13448𓀴There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
13449𓀴must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
13450𓀴know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
13451𓀴is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!” She looked
13452𓀴appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.
13453𓀴
13454𓀴“What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is that
13455𓀴way, which we must not--may not--take?”
13456𓀴
13457𓀴“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
13458𓀴the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
13459𓀴once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
13460𓀴did my poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
13461𓀴that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
13462𓀴friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
13463𓀴in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
13464𓀴done, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the
13465𓀴certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
13466𓀴blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all
13467𓀴silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The
13468𓀴faces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
13469𓀴guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--
13470𓀴
13471𓀴“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note the
13472𓀴quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
13473𓀴seriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know,” she went
13474𓀴on quickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and you
13475𓀴can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She looked
13476𓀴again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quincey
13477𓀴seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell
13478𓀴you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
13479𓀴connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,
13480𓀴my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”
13481𓀴
13482𓀴“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low and
13483𓀴strained.
13484𓀴
13485𓀴“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
13486𓀴I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
13487𓀴without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
13488𓀴or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”
13489𓀴
13490𓀴Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
13491𓀴and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--
13492𓀴
13493𓀴“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to
13494𓀴win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and
13495𓀴dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty
13496𓀴that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
13497𓀴certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
13498𓀴come!”
13499𓀴
13500𓀴“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
13501𓀴bending over, she kissed his hand.
13502𓀴
13503𓀴“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.
13504𓀴
13505𓀴“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
13506𓀴take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her
13507𓀴wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
13508𓀴his hair, and asked:--
13509𓀴
13510𓀴“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”
13511𓀴
13512𓀴“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
13513𓀴voice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and
13514𓀴all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
13515𓀴time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
13516𓀴their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
13517𓀴hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because
13518𓀴those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men’s duty
13519𓀴towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my
13520𓀴dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at
13521𓀴the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
13522𓀴forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stopped
13523𓀴with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best right
13524𓀴to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
13525𓀴it a happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which
13526𓀴set me free from the awful thrall upon me.”
13527𓀴
13528𓀴“Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
13529𓀴smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
13530𓀴said:--
13531𓀴
13532𓀴“And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
13533𓀴this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
13534𓀴such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
13535𓀴time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
13536𓀴with your enemy against you.”
13537𓀴
13538𓀴“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not
13539𓀴vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
13540𓀴me, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
13541𓀴to speak:--
13542𓀴
13543𓀴“I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was interrupted by a deep
13544𓀴groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
13545𓀴heart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
13546𓀴be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
13547𓀴thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
13548𓀴then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”
13549𓀴
13550𓀴“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”
13551𓀴
13552𓀴“Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death at
13553𓀴this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
13554𓀴
13555𓀴“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began.
13556𓀴
13557𓀴“It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began to
13558𓀴read when she had got the book ready.
13559𓀴
13560𓀴“How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
13561𓀴solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
13562𓀴sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
13563𓀴truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
13564𓀴had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
13565𓀴round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
13566𓀴her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
13567𓀴had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial
13568𓀴of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”
13569𓀴

13571𓀴
13572𓀴She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
13573𓀴hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
13574𓀴comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s coming
13575𓀴relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
13576𓀴of us as we had dreaded.
13577𓀴
13578𓀴
13579𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
13580𓀴
13581𓀴_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
13582𓀴got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
13583𓀴Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
13584𓀴o’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
13585𓀴arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the
13586𓀴Odessus.” The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
13587𓀴to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into
13588𓀴port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
13589𓀴Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
13590𓀴coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept
13591𓀴nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
13592𓀴wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
13593𓀴hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
13594𓀴had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
13595𓀴habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
13596𓀴these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
13597𓀴always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--
13598𓀴
13599𓀴“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the second:--
13600𓀴
13601𓀴“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
13602𓀴by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
13603𓀴high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”
13604𓀴It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
13605𓀴her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
13606𓀴telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
13607𓀴that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd’s from
13608𓀴anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
13609𓀴send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
13610𓀴was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
13611𓀴sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.
13612𓀴
13613𓀴We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the
13614𓀴Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
13615𓀴as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
13616𓀴on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
13617𓀴form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
13618𓀴so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man’s form without
13619𓀴suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
13620𓀴box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
13621𓀴for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
13622𓀴before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for
13623𓀴much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
13624𓀴seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
13625𓀴and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
13626𓀴ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
13627𓀴warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
13628𓀴think!
13629𓀴

13631𓀴
13632𓀴_16 October._--Mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
13633𓀴water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
13634𓀴when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must
13635𓀴pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
13636𓀴
13637𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
13638𓀴
13639𓀴_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
13640𓀴the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
13641𓀴he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
13642𓀴a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own
13643𓀴risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
13644𓀴facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a
13645𓀴similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
13646𓀴was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all
13647𓀴satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We
13648𓀴have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the
13649𓀴Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and
13650𓀴drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall
13651𓀴prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
13652𓀴have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s body,
13653𓀴it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
13654𓀴evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
13655𓀴even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
13656𓀴some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
13657𓀴a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it
13658𓀴were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our
13659𓀴intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
13660𓀴_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special
13661𓀴messenger.

13665𓀴_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
13666𓀴but only the same story: “Not yet reported.” Mina’s morning and evening
13667𓀴hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
13668𓀴masts.

13678𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
13679𓀴
13680𓀴_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is
13681𓀴irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
13682𓀴excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I
13683𓀴know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
13684𓀴Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
13685𓀴all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
13686𓀴let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
13687𓀴excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
13688𓀴sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
13689𓀴in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
13690𓀴lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
13691𓀴getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
13692𓀴talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
13693𓀴would break poor Harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we
13694𓀴had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
13695𓀴her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
13696𓀴he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active
13697𓀴danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be
13698𓀴necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to
13699𓀴be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
13700𓀴neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
13701𓀴“Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
13702𓀴whoever invented it.
13703𓀴
13704𓀴It is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
13705𓀴rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore
13706𓀴arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
13707𓀴before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
13708𓀴o’clock, so as to be ready.

13711𓀴
13712𓀴_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’s
13713𓀴hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
13714𓀴that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
13715𓀴excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
13716𓀴an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
13717𓀴which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
13718𓀴Count if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by
13719𓀴that stern, ice-cold hand!
13720𓀴
13721𓀴Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About
13722𓀴noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
13723𓀴kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She
13724𓀴had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
13725𓀴that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
13726𓀴that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to
13727𓀴her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
13728𓀴well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
13729𓀴anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
13730𓀴that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.

13733𓀴
13734𓀴_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
13735𓀴of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
13736𓀴been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
13737𓀴may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
13738𓀴his doom, I trust!
13739𓀴
13740𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
13741𓀴
13742𓀴_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.
13743𓀴She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
13744𓀴apparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
13745𓀴same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
13746𓀴some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
13747𓀴both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
13748𓀴the ship may now be signalled any moment.
13749𓀴
13750𓀴       *       *       *       *       *
13751𓀴
13752𓀴_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
13753𓀴Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping
13754𓀴waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very
13755𓀴faint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further
13756𓀴report.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
13757𓀴fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--
13758𓀴
13759𓀴“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can do
13760𓀴strange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker
13761𓀴just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night
13762𓀴at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.

13766𓀴     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
13767𓀴     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._
13768𓀴
13769𓀴     “_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o’clock
13770𓀴     to-day.”
13771𓀴
13772𓀴
13773𓀴_Dr. Seward’s Diary._
13774𓀴
13775𓀴_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
13776𓀴do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
13777𓀴expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
13778𓀴come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
13779𓀴The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
13780𓀴would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
13781𓀴change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
13782𓀴that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
13783𓀴ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
13784𓀴that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if
13785𓀴it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all
13786𓀴took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a
13787𓀴moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a
13788𓀴word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
13789𓀴Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half
13790𓀴stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
13791𓀴tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
13792𓀴old wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
13793𓀴that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
13794𓀴meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the
13795𓀴dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
13796𓀴action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
13797𓀴the great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start
13798𓀴for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.
13799𓀴
13800𓀴“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came from
13801𓀴Mrs. Harker.
13802𓀴
13803𓀴“How on earth do you know?” said Art.
13804𓀴
13805𓀴“You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
13806𓀴does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I
13807𓀴always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
13808𓀴husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
13809𓀴the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
13810𓀴Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I
13811𓀴learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
13812𓀴as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”
13813𓀴
13814𓀴“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.
13815𓀴
13816𓀴“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
13817𓀴head: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
13818𓀴if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
13819𓀴regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
13820𓀴Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
13821𓀴tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
13822𓀴you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
13823𓀴letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
13824𓀴just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get
13825𓀴his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
13826𓀴smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
13827𓀴with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
13828𓀴may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
13829𓀴with Madam to make report.”
13830𓀴
13831𓀴“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
13832𓀴had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and
13833𓀴shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
13834𓀴from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”
13835𓀴The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
13836𓀴realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
13837𓀴each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
13838𓀴time, however.
13839𓀴
13840𓀴When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
13841𓀴Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
13842𓀴Harker’s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door
13843𓀴was shut upon her he said to me:--
13844𓀴
13845𓀴“We mean the same! speak out!”
13846𓀴
13847𓀴“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
13848𓀴deceive us.”
13849𓀴
13850𓀴“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”
13851𓀴
13852𓀴“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”
13853𓀴
13854𓀴“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
13855𓀴you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;
13856𓀴but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
13857𓀴words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In
13858𓀴the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her
13859𓀴mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
13860𓀴with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn
13861𓀴then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
13862𓀴eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
13863𓀴Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.
13864𓀴
13865𓀴“He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
13866𓀴but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
13867𓀴so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that
13868𓀴have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
13869𓀴come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
13870𓀴that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
13871𓀴therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
13872𓀴She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
13873𓀴we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
13874𓀴brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have
13875𓀴a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
13876𓀴altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
13877𓀴learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
13878𓀴feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”
13879𓀴
13880𓀴I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
13881𓀴just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
13882𓀴himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
13883𓀴the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
13884𓀴forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
13885𓀴of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
13886𓀴brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and
13887𓀴thumb he said:--
13888𓀴
13889𓀴“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
13890𓀴dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
13891𓀴think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
13892𓀴let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
13893𓀴where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought
13894𓀴at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
13895𓀴strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend
13896𓀴Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that
13897𓀴sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
13898𓀴read here what Jonathan have written:--
13899𓀴
13900𓀴“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
13901𓀴his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
13902𓀴beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
13903𓀴alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
13904𓀴since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”
13905𓀴
13906𓀴“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought see
13907𓀴nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my
13908𓀴man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
13909𓀴from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
13910𓀴it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
13911𓀴yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then
13912𓀴pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
13913𓀴and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
13914𓀴leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
13915𓀴study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it is
13916𓀴a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not
13917𓀴but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
13918𓀴universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,
13919𓀴in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
13920𓀴from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to
13921𓀴be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
13922𓀴criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
13923𓀴This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and
13924𓀴resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of
13925𓀴child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
13926𓀴also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
13927𓀴have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
13928𓀴by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to
13929𓀴him the ground to start from to do more. ‘_Dos pou sto_,’ said
13930𓀴Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once,
13931𓀴is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have
13932𓀴the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,
13933𓀴just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
13934𓀴opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for
13935𓀴Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--
13936𓀴
13937𓀴“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
13938𓀴those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
13939𓀴His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
13940𓀴unconsciously, as she spoke:--
13941𓀴
13942𓀴“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would
13943𓀴so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.
13944𓀴Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a
13945𓀴clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
13946𓀴lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
13947𓀴‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had
13948𓀴tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
13949𓀴for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
13950𓀴So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
13951𓀴hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
13952𓀴the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
13953𓀴from Turkey Land.”
13954𓀴
13955𓀴“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,
13956𓀴enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he
13957𓀴said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
13958𓀴consultation:--
13959𓀴
13960𓀴“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to
13961𓀴her again, he said with keen expectation:--
13962𓀴
13963𓀴“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
13964𓀴John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
13965𓀴Speak, without fear!”
13966𓀴
13967𓀴“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”
13968𓀴
13969𓀴“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”
13970𓀴
13971𓀴“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
13972𓀴and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
13973𓀴purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
13974𓀴leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
13975𓀴safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
13976𓀴from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful
13977𓀴night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul
13978𓀴is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
13979𓀴is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for
13980𓀴his ends.” The Professor stood up:--
13981𓀴
13982𓀴“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
13983𓀴whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
13984𓀴Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
13985𓀴But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
13986𓀴God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
13987𓀴his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken
13988𓀴in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he
13989𓀴is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so
13990𓀴many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
13991𓀴sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
13992𓀴there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That
13993𓀴terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him
13994𓀴in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
13995𓀴sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;
13996𓀴and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
13997𓀴suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know
13998𓀴it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
13999𓀴knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe
14000𓀴that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
14001𓀴hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
14002𓀴ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great
14003𓀴hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe
14004𓀴and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
14005𓀴you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”
14006𓀴
14007𓀴And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
14008𓀴has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.

14016𓀴
14017𓀴
14018𓀴_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
14019𓀴night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
14020𓀴had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
14021𓀴and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
14022𓀴for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
14023𓀴Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
14024𓀴more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
14025𓀴necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
14026𓀴this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
14027𓀴resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--
14028𓀴
14029𓀴“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a
14030𓀴steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
14031𓀴men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
14032𓀴the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
14033𓀴There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
14034𓀴along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
14035𓀴blowing upon me.”
14036𓀴
14037𓀴Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
14038𓀴on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
14039𓀴weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
14040𓀴Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
14041𓀴Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
14042𓀴was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
14043𓀴passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she
14044𓀴sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--
14045𓀴
14046𓀴“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We
14047𓀴could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
14048𓀴tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--
14049𓀴
14050𓀴“You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his
14051𓀴earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
14052𓀴hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
14053𓀴not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
14054𓀴in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did
14055𓀴at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
14056𓀴be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
14057𓀴may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on
14058𓀴shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
14059𓀴We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come
14060𓀴on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his
14061𓀴true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”
14062𓀴
14063𓀴There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
14064𓀴at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.
14065𓀴
14066𓀴Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
14067𓀴response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
14068𓀴than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
14069𓀴so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
14070𓀴soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
14071𓀴reply:--
14072𓀴
14073𓀴“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
14074𓀴of wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
14075𓀴to-night.
14076𓀴
14077𓀴And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
14078𓀴expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
14079𓀴but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
14080𓀴possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more
14081𓀴hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
14082𓀴more light on what is happening.
14083𓀴

14085𓀴
14086𓀴_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when
14087𓀴there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
14088𓀴station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
14089𓀴Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
14090𓀴this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s
14091𓀴sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
14092𓀴her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
14093𓀴hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
14094𓀴on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s power
14095𓀴over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
14096𓀴a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
14097𓀴speak, her words were enigmatical:--
14098𓀴
14099𓀴“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
14100𓀴hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
14101𓀴fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” She stopped and a
14102𓀴shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
14103𓀴till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
14104𓀴in answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning. When she woke from
14105𓀴the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
14106𓀴all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
14107𓀴when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
14108𓀴silence.

14111𓀴
14112𓀴_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
14113𓀴to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
14114𓀴Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
14115𓀴Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
14116𓀴effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
14117𓀴greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
14118𓀴lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--
14119𓀴
14120𓀴“All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
14121𓀴creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
14122𓀴queer one like----” She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.
14123𓀴
14124𓀴“Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonised
14125𓀴voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
14126𓀴was reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we
14127𓀴all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
14128𓀴unconcern:--
14129𓀴
14130𓀴“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t remember
14131𓀴anything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
14132𓀴turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--
14133𓀴
14134𓀴“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
14135𓀴lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command you!’
14136𓀴It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
14137𓀴child!”
14138𓀴
14139𓀴“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of
14140𓀴how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
14141𓀴earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
14142𓀴am proud to obey!”
14143𓀴
14144𓀴The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
14145𓀴anxiety and eagerness.

14150𓀴_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
14151𓀴ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
14152𓀴he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
14153𓀴much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
14154𓀴Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
14155𓀴sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
14156𓀴doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
14157𓀴of the _Czarina Catherine_.

14166𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
14167𓀴
14168𓀴_30 October._--At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
14169𓀴on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
14170𓀴Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
14171𓀴Godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
14172𓀴their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
14173𓀴on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
14174𓀴harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his
14175𓀴voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a
14176𓀴run.
14177𓀴
14178𓀴“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
14179𓀴have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the
14180𓀴average. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind
14181𓀴ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his
14182𓀴ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
14183𓀴a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,
14184𓀴till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
14185𓀴we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we
14186𓀴came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
14187𓀴never were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
14188𓀴and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the
14189𓀴Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it
14190𓀴whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our
14191𓀴miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who
14192𓀴had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
14193𓀴hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
14194𓀴and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--
14195𓀴
14196𓀴“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
14197𓀴he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the
14198𓀴compliment, and went on:--
14199𓀴
14200𓀴“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,
14201𓀴the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
14202𓀴been put on board by a queer lookin’ old man just before we had started
14203𓀴frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
14204𓀴fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
14205𓀴supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
14206𓀴their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I
14207𓀴felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was
14208𓀴agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for
14209𓀴five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get
14210𓀴somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well,
14211𓀴we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and
14212𓀴deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came
14213𓀴through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
14214𓀴The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
14215𓀴box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a
14216𓀴handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in
14217𓀴his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the
14218𓀴property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
14219𓀴river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
14220𓀴fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I’d let it
14221𓀴lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. We
14222𓀴didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor;
14223𓀴but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came
14224𓀴aboard wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box
14225𓀴marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
14226𓀴his hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the
14227𓀴dam’ thing, for I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil
14228𓀴did have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither
14229𓀴than that same!”
14230𓀴
14231𓀴“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with
14232𓀴restrained eagerness.
14233𓀴
14234𓀴“I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to his
14235𓀴cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse
14236𓀴16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
14237𓀴with thanks we came away.
14238𓀴
14239𓀴We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
14240𓀴Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
14241𓀴pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little
14242𓀴bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but
14243𓀴important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
14244𓀴him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
14245𓀴which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
14246𓀴give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
14247𓀴who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by
14248𓀴an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
14249𓀴International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
14250𓀴the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
14251𓀴he knew.
14252𓀴
14253𓀴We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
14254𓀴neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
14255𓀴gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by
14256𓀴his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
14257𓀴together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
14258𓀴and eleven o’clock last night. We were at a standstill again.
14259𓀴
14260𓀴Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
14261𓀴the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
14262𓀴St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
14263𓀴animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
14264𓀴women crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!” We hurried away lest we
14265𓀴should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.
14266𓀴
14267𓀴As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
14268𓀴convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
14269𓀴that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
14270𓀴to the hotel to Mina.
14271𓀴
14272𓀴When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
14273𓀴again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
14274𓀴least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
14275𓀴released from my promise to her.

14280𓀴_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited
14281𓀴that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
14282𓀴them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
14283𓀴up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
14284𓀴“Traveller’s” typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for
14285𓀴me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write
14286𓀴with a pen....
14287𓀴
14288𓀴It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
14289𓀴what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
14290𓀴breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his
14291𓀴face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can
14292𓀴see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!
14293𓀴if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.
14294𓀴
14295𓀴I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I
14296𓀴have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
14297𓀴carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
14298𓀴follow the Professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts
14299𓀴before me....

14313𓀴_Mina Harker’s Memorandum._
14314𓀴
14315𓀴(Entered in her Journal.)
14316𓀴
14317𓀴_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his own
14318𓀴place.
14319𓀴
14320𓀴(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he
14321𓀴power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,
14322𓀴or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
14323𓀴interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined
14324𓀴as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.
14325𓀴
14326𓀴(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help
14327𓀴us. By road, by rail, by water?
14328𓀴
14329𓀴1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
14330𓀴city.
14331𓀴
14332𓀴(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
14333𓀴a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.
14334𓀴
14335𓀴(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.
14336𓀴
14337𓀴(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
14338𓀴to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
14339𓀴his victim--me!
14340𓀴
14341𓀴2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
14342𓀴take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
14343𓀴on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if
14344𓀴left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
14345𓀴what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.
14346𓀴
14347𓀴3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
14348𓀴danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
14349𓀴then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
14350𓀴he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
14351𓀴indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
14352𓀴unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
14353𓀴still be desperate.
14354𓀴
14355𓀴We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
14356𓀴is to ascertain _what_ water.
14357𓀴
14358𓀴The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
14359𓀴then, get a light on what his later task is to be.
14360𓀴
14361𓀴_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
14362𓀴of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
14363𓀴to arrange as best he could.
14364𓀴
14365𓀴_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
14366𓀴know of, what he has done here.
14367𓀴
14368𓀴As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
14369𓀴invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
14370𓀴exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
14371𓀴The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
14372𓀴Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
14373𓀴also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
14374𓀴there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
14375𓀴Hildesheim.
14376𓀴
14377𓀴That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
14378𓀴made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson’s
14379𓀴suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
14380𓀴played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
14381𓀴through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
14382𓀴Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
14383𓀴the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here
14384𓀴we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
14385𓀴moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
14386𓀴avoided.
14387𓀴
14388𓀴Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on
14389𓀴land_, at Galatz.
14390𓀴
14391𓀴The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
14392𓀴appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
14393𓀴aid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
14394𓀴with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s
14395𓀴remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
14396𓀴feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.
14397𓀴
14398𓀴My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
14399𓀴castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
14400𓀴the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
14401𓀴who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
14402𓀴Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
14403𓀴service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
14404𓀴came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
14405𓀴arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
14406𓀴he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
14407𓀴by murdering his agent.
14408𓀴
14409𓀴I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
14410𓀴Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
14411𓀴the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
14412𓀴level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
14413𓀴was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
14414𓀴poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
14415𓀴would be no such sound if floating down stream.
14416𓀴
14417𓀴Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
14418𓀴possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
14419𓀴easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
14420𓀴which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
14421𓀴close to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.

14424𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal--continued._
14425𓀴
14426𓀴When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
14427𓀴others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--
14428𓀴
14429𓀴“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
14430𓀴we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
14431𓀴may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
14432𓀴him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
14433𓀴is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
14434𓀴him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
14435𓀴him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,
14436𓀴to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
14437𓀴shall do.”
14438𓀴
14439𓀴“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.
14440𓀴
14441𓀴“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr.
14442𓀴Morris.
14443𓀴
14444𓀴“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. There
14445𓀴must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
14446𓀴rough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst them
14447𓀴they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--
14448𓀴
14449𓀴“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
14450𓀴there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
14451𓀴precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
14452𓀴not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr.
14453𓀴Seward said:--
14454𓀴
14455𓀴“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
14456𓀴together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
14457𓀴along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
14458𓀴Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don’t suppose these fellows carry
14459𓀴guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we
14460𓀴shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and
14461𓀴we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he
14462𓀴spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
14463𓀴torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the
14464𓀴boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
14465𓀴the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
14466𓀴silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--
14467𓀴
14468𓀴“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
14469𓀴are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
14470𓀴last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
14471𓀴wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
14472𓀴will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as
14473𓀴once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
14474𓀴fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in
14475𓀴other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let
14476𓀴me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
14477𓀴friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
14478𓀴whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
14479𓀴landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s
14480𓀴country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
14481𓀴stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid
14482𓀴of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
14483𓀴perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz
14484𓀴over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
14485𓀴Mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
14486𓀴dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
14487𓀴that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be
14488𓀴made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here
14489𓀴Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--
14490𓀴
14491𓀴“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
14492𓀴in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right
14493𓀴into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
14494𓀴Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--
14495𓀴
14496𓀴“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
14497𓀴infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
14498𓀴speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
14499𓀴Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned to
14500𓀴me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:
14501𓀴“Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and he sank
14502𓀴down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he
14503𓀴spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
14504𓀴us all:--
14505𓀴
14506𓀴“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
14507𓀴place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
14508𓀴place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
14509𓀴see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
14510𓀴is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
14511𓀴terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and
14512𓀴subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then
14513𓀴in time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep him
14514𓀴company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
14515𓀴told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
14516𓀴clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
14517𓀴well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
14518𓀴necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
14519𓀴possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
14520𓀴it is I who would have to go to keep them company.”
14521𓀴
14522𓀴“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “we
14523𓀴are in the hands of God!”

14526𓀴
14527𓀴_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
14528𓀴How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
14529𓀴so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
14530𓀴What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
14531𓀴when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
14532𓀴that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
14533𓀴to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
14534𓀴not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
14535𓀴another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
14536𓀴of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
14537𓀴launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Seward
14538𓀴and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have
14539𓀴all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor
14540𓀴Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,
14541𓀴where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
14542𓀴bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and
14543𓀴horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust
14544𓀴in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,
14545𓀴so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a
14546𓀴large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
14547𓀴the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
14548𓀴forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me
14549𓀴that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
14550𓀴colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
14551𓀴warnings.

14554𓀴
14555𓀴_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may
14556𓀴never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
14557𓀴his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that
14558𓀴God will let them fall in gladness.

14560𓀴
14561𓀴_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
14562𓀴
14563𓀴_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
14564𓀴door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
14565𓀴experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
14566𓀴own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
14567𓀴plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any
14568𓀴waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the
14569𓀴Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took
14570𓀴it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
14571𓀴place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
14572𓀴Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
14573𓀴night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
14574𓀴make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to
14575𓀴sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
14576𓀴watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging
14577𓀴over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only
14578𓀴comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would
14579𓀴be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.
14580𓀴Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;
14581𓀴they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
14582𓀴lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
14583𓀴of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
14584𓀴their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
14585𓀴they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
14586𓀴after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
14587𓀴can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
14588𓀴can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.
14589𓀴
14590𓀴It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
14591𓀴the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
14592𓀴us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
14593𓀴home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
14594𓀴a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
14595𓀴furnace door....

14598𓀴
14599𓀴_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
14600𓀴sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
14601𓀴is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
14602𓀴a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
14603𓀴anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
14604𓀴time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
14605𓀴prayed.

14608𓀴
14609𓀴_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the
14610𓀴kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
14611𓀴in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big
14612𓀴and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
14613𓀴and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
14614𓀴so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
14615𓀴Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
14616𓀴have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
14617𓀴deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
14618𓀴to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
14619𓀴going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
14620𓀴was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
14621𓀴boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
14622𓀴we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
14623𓀴night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
14624𓀴upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
14625𓀴shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor
14626𓀴dear Mina and me.

14630𓀴_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
14631𓀴wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and
14632𓀴was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
14633𓀴so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
14634𓀴man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
14635𓀴all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
14636𓀴keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
14637𓀴me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
14638𓀴Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
14639𓀴carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
14640𓀴would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
14641𓀴afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
14642𓀴cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
14643𓀴Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
14644𓀴streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
14645𓀴are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
14646𓀴doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
14647𓀴met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
14648𓀴them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
14649𓀴necessary to take counsel together what to do next.

14655𓀴if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
14656𓀴rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
14657𓀴Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;

14663𓀴Bistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and
14664𓀴if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and
14665𓀴go on, Russian fashion.

14669𓀴_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
14670𓀴accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get
14671𓀴up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
14672𓀴only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
14673𓀴evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
14674𓀴up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
14675𓀴afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
14676𓀴peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
14677𓀴stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
14678𓀴on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.

14683𓀴_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
14684𓀴this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I
14685𓀴could say was: “dark and quiet.” He is off now buying a carriage and
14686𓀴horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
14687𓀴that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
14688𓀴than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if
14689𓀴only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
14690𓀴see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
14691𓀴pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
14692𓀴their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
14693𓀴picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
14694𓀴people! But, alas!--

14698𓀴_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
14699𓀴horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
14700𓀴landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
14701𓀴for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
14702𓀴me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
14703𓀴been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
14704𓀴and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
14705𓀴our being cold.

14711𓀴with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
14712𓀴my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
14713𓀴loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
14714𓀴truest thought will be always for him.

14722𓀴
14723𓀴
14724𓀴_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
14725𓀴horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
14726𓀴willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
14727𓀴changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
14728𓀴think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
14729𓀴he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
14730𓀴to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
14731𓀴off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
14732𓀴kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
14733𓀴of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
14734𓀴house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
14735𓀴forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
14736𓀴keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
14737𓀴extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic. Ever
14738𓀴since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
14739𓀴escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
14740𓀴driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
14741𓀴that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
14742𓀴Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
14743𓀴made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
14744𓀴says that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking
14745𓀴wood”; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
14746𓀴Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
14747𓀴this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
14748𓀴Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
14749𓀴grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his sleep
14750𓀴he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
14751𓀴him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
14752𓀴and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
14753𓀴needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.

14757𓀴_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all
14758𓀴night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
14759𓀴heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
14760𓀴that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
14761𓀴us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
14762𓀴“darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as
14763𓀴they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
14764𓀴danger--more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.

14767𓀴
14768𓀴_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
14769𓀴we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
14770𓀴so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
14771𓀴and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
14772𓀴effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
14773𓀴Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
14774𓀴houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
14775𓀴we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
14776𓀴got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
14777𓀴four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
14778𓀴trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
14779𓀴drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
14780𓀴before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
14781𓀴will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
14782𓀴darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
14783𓀴that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
14784𓀴and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
14785𓀴sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
14786𓀴to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred
14787𓀴His wrath.

14790𓀴_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._
14791𓀴
14792𓀴_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of
14793𓀴Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
14794𓀴morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
14795𓀴alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
14796𓀴heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
14797𓀴winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
14798𓀴affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
14799𓀴not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
14800𓀴so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
14801𓀴her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
14802𓀴faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
14803𓀴However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
14804𓀴and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
14805𓀴I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
14806𓀴less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,
14807𓀴God’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!
14808𓀴
14809𓀴Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I
14810𓀴must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
14811𓀴unrecorded.
14812𓀴
14813𓀴We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
14814𓀴saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
14815𓀴carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
14816𓀴couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
14817𓀴more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
14818𓀴before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then she
14819𓀴woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
14820𓀴At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
14821𓀴guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--
14822𓀴
14823𓀴“This is the way.”
14824𓀴
14825𓀴“How know you it?” I ask.
14826𓀴
14827𓀴“Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not my
14828𓀴Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”
14829𓀴
14830𓀴At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
14831𓀴such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
14832𓀴road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
14833𓀴more of use.
14834𓀴
14835𓀴So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
14836𓀴sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
14837𓀴have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
14838𓀴they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
14839𓀴have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
14840𓀴hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
14841𓀴she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
14842𓀴suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
14843𓀴not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
14844𓀴her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
14845𓀴all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
14846𓀴guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
14847𓀴reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
14848𓀴look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
14849𓀴time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
14850𓀴so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
14851𓀴For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
14852𓀴it were the end of the world.
14853𓀴
14854𓀴Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
14855𓀴then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
14856𓀴though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
14857𓀴myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
14858𓀴Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
14859𓀴and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
14860𓀴first enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
14861𓀴is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
14862𓀴light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
14863𓀴prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
14864𓀴to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
14865𓀴to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that
14866𓀴she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
14867𓀴grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
14868𓀴help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
14869𓀴fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
14870𓀴of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
14871𓀴quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
14872𓀴more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
14873𓀴wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
14874𓀴obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
14875𓀴sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
14876𓀴to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
14877𓀴harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
14878𓀴in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
14879𓀴not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even
14880𓀴to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
14881𓀴death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.

14885𓀴_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you
14886𓀴and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
14887𓀴that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
14888𓀴strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
14889𓀴
14890𓀴All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
14891𓀴moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
14892𓀴frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
14893𓀴sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
14894𓀴did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I
14895𓀴began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
14896𓀴she is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it be
14897𓀴that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
14898𓀴night.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
14899𓀴imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
14900𓀴with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
14901𓀴sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
14902𓀴mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
14903𓀴steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
14904𓀴of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
14905𓀴the end was near.
14906𓀴
14907𓀴I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
14908𓀴unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
14909𓀴even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
14910𓀴all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed
14911𓀴them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
14912𓀴Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
14913𓀴her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
14914𓀴she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
14915𓀴I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
14916𓀴fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
14917𓀴where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
14918𓀴I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
14919𓀴time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
14920𓀴snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
14921𓀴clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
14922𓀴feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
14923𓀴she had grown more quiet:--
14924𓀴
14925𓀴“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test of
14926𓀴what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
14927𓀴stopped, and stood as one stricken.
14928𓀴
14929𓀴“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat
14930𓀴down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
14931𓀴from sleep, she said simply:--
14932𓀴
14933𓀴“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
14934𓀴could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
14935𓀴danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!
14936𓀴
14937𓀴Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
14938𓀴came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they
14939𓀴whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
14940𓀴time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to
14941𓀴the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
14942𓀴with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was
14943𓀴about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
14944𓀴sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
14945𓀴some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
14946𓀴snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
14947𓀴trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
14948𓀴whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
14949𓀴fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
14950𓀴ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
14951𓀴the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
14952𓀴all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s
14953𓀴horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
14954𓀴began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
14955𓀴glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
14956𓀴cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
14957𓀴the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
14958𓀴feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
14959𓀴circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
14960𓀴I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
14961𓀴me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
14962𓀴it was:--
14963𓀴
14964𓀴“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and
14965𓀴looking in her eyes, said:--
14966𓀴
14967𓀴“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
14968𓀴and unreal, and said:--
14969𓀴
14970𓀴“Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
14971𓀴than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
14972𓀴wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
14973𓀴Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
14974𓀴wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
14975𓀴the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not
14976𓀴take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me
14977𓀴in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when
14978𓀴they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
14979𓀴bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
14980𓀴lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
14981𓀴through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
14982𓀴her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
14983𓀴of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--
14984𓀴
14985𓀴“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poor
14986𓀴Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
14987𓀴terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
14988𓀴heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
14989𓀴seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
14990𓀴Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
14991𓀴laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
14992𓀴I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not
14993𓀴approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within
14994𓀴the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The
14995𓀴horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
14996𓀴them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
14997𓀴beasts no more of terror.
14998𓀴
14999𓀴And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
15000𓀴snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
15001𓀴when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
15002𓀴At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
15003𓀴whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
15004𓀴towards the castle, and were lost.
15005𓀴
15006𓀴Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
15007𓀴to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
15008𓀴could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
15009𓀴no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
15010𓀴made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have
15011𓀴much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
15012𓀴may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
15013𓀴obscure it, will be to me a safety.
15014𓀴
15015𓀴I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
15016𓀴work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
15017𓀴sleep....

15023𓀴thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
15024𓀴and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
15025𓀴off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we
15026𓀴follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
15027𓀴have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only
15028𓀴Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more
15029𓀴Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.

15034𓀴_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
15035𓀴away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a
15036𓀴cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
15037𓀴and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own
15038𓀴feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
15039𓀴wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
15040𓀴dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
15041𓀴and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
15042𓀴or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....

15045𓀴_Dr. Van Helsing’s Memorandum._
15046𓀴
15047𓀴_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy
15048𓀴at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left
15049𓀴Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
15050𓀴The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was
15051𓀴useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
15052𓀴hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
15053𓀴being entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served
15054𓀴me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
15055𓀴knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
15056𓀴there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
15057𓀴there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
15058𓀴Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
15059𓀴The dilemma had me between his horns.
15060𓀴
15061𓀴Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
15062𓀴Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
15063𓀴resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
15064𓀴submit, if it were God’s will. At any rate it was only death and
15065𓀴freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the
15066𓀴choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
15067𓀴the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.
15068𓀴
15069𓀴I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
15070𓀴inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her
15071𓀴Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as
15072𓀴though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when
15073𓀴such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,
15074𓀴found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,
15075𓀴and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
15076𓀴wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
15077𓀴come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
15078𓀴woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
15079𓀴kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
15080𓀴fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...
15081𓀴
15082𓀴There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
15083𓀴of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
15084𓀴heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
15085𓀴as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,
15086𓀴with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a
15087𓀴yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
15088𓀴very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
15089𓀴strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
15090𓀴was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
15091𓀴to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
15092𓀴long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
15093𓀴of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.
15094𓀴
15095𓀴Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
15096𓀴away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
15097𓀴pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
15098𓀴begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in
15099𓀴a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
15100𓀴which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
15101𓀴the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
15102𓀴exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
15103𓀴some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
15104𓀴with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam
15105𓀴Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
15106𓀴further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had
15107𓀴searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as
15108𓀴there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the
15109𓀴night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.
15110𓀴There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
15111𓀴nobly proportioned. On it was but one word
15112𓀴
15113𓀴                                DRACULA.
15114𓀴
15115𓀴This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more
15116𓀴were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
15117𓀴Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
15118𓀴awful work, I laid in Dracula’s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
15119𓀴him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.
15120𓀴
15121𓀴Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
15122𓀴had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
15123𓀴been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
15124𓀴Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
15125𓀴through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
15126𓀴years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....
15127𓀴
15128𓀴Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
15129𓀴thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
15130𓀴fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
15131𓀴till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
15132𓀴the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
15133𓀴ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
15134𓀴won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
15135𓀴endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
15136𓀴writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
15137𓀴left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them
15138𓀴now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
15139𓀴for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife
15140𓀴severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
15141𓀴crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
15142𓀴centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “I
15143𓀴am here!”
15144𓀴
15145𓀴Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
15146𓀴the Count enter there Un-Dead.
15147𓀴
15148𓀴When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
15149𓀴sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.
15150𓀴
15151𓀴“Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
15152𓀴husband who is, I know, coming towards us.” She was looking thin and
15153𓀴pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
15154𓀴glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
15155𓀴fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.
15156𓀴
15157𓀴And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
15158𓀴our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are
15159𓀴coming to meet us.

15162𓀴_Mina Harker’s Journal._
15163𓀴
15164𓀴_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
15165𓀴took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did
15166𓀴not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
15167𓀴heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
15168𓀴left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our
15169𓀴provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we
15170𓀴could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
15171𓀴habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
15172𓀴walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the
15173𓀴clear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
15174𓀴the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
15175𓀴Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
15176𓀴perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
15177𓀴seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
15178𓀴on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We
15179𓀴could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
15180𓀴sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
15181𓀴full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
15182𓀴that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
15183𓀴exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
15184𓀴could trace it through the drifted snow.
15185𓀴
15186𓀴In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
15187𓀴him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
15188𓀴with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the
15189𓀴hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; and
15190𓀴if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our
15191𓀴furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
15192𓀴forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was
15193𓀴repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could
15194𓀴not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
15195𓀴reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top
15196𓀴of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--
15197𓀴
15198𓀴“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the
15199𓀴rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
15200𓀴more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
15201𓀴to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
15202𓀴snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we
15203𓀴were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
15204𓀴white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
15205𓀴kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
15206𓀴off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a
15207𓀴group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a
15208𓀴long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail
15209𓀴wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
15210𓀴snow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were
15211𓀴peasants or gypsies of some kind.
15212𓀴
15213𓀴On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
15214𓀴felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and
15215𓀴well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
15216𓀴there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
15217𓀴pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
15218𓀴however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
15219𓀴the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
15220𓀴night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--
15221𓀴
15222𓀴“At least you shall be safe here from _him_!” He took the glasses from
15223𓀴me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
15224𓀴“See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
15225𓀴galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow
15226𓀴voice:--
15227𓀴
15228𓀴“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be
15229𓀴done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
15230𓀴landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
15231𓀴glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--
15232𓀴
15233𓀴“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
15234𓀴south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow
15235𓀴blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward
15236𓀴and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.
15237𓀴At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around
15238𓀴I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
15239𓀴break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,
15240𓀴of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with
15241𓀴the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
15242𓀴and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he
15243𓀴laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
15244𓀴opening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When the
15245𓀴time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolver
15246𓀴ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
15247𓀴louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
15248𓀴It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
15249𓀴and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
15250𓀴towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
15251𓀴see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
15252𓀴numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.
15253𓀴
15254𓀴Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
15255𓀴fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
15256𓀴circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us;
15257𓀴but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
15258𓀴clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
15259𓀴late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
15260𓀴with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
15261𓀴sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
15262𓀴than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
15263𓀴bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer
15264𓀴and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
15265𓀴had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
15266𓀴the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
15267𓀴party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did
15268𓀴not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
15269𓀴seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
15270𓀴and lower on the mountain tops.
15271𓀴
15272𓀴Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
15273𓀴our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
15274𓀴that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
15275𓀴presence.
15276𓀴
15277𓀴All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s,
15278𓀴raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’ strong resolute
15279𓀴tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but
15280𓀴there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
15281𓀴spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
15282𓀴and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
15283𓀴other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his
15284𓀴horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
15285𓀴companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang
15286𓀴forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an
15287𓀴unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
15288𓀴Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
15289𓀴Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
15290𓀴up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the
15291𓀴gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
15292𓀴himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.
15293𓀴
15294𓀴The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
15295𓀴front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
15296𓀴tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
15297𓀴For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
15298𓀴and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing
15299𓀴Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
15300𓀴upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,
15301𓀴surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our
15302𓀴parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly
15303𓀴formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
15304𓀴shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
15305𓀴order.
15306𓀴
15307𓀴In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
15308𓀴of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was
15309𓀴evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
15310𓀴should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
15311𓀴levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
15312𓀴the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
15313𓀴attention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
15314𓀴purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
15315𓀴cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the
15316𓀴cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
15317𓀴box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
15318𓀴Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
15319𓀴Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
15320𓀴with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
15321𓀴seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and
15322𓀴they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
15323𓀴I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang
15324𓀴beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that
15325𓀴with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
15326𓀴spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for
15327𓀴as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
15328𓀴attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
15329𓀴the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the
15330𓀴lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and
15331𓀴the top of the box was thrown back.
15332𓀴
15333𓀴By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
15334𓀴and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
15335𓀴no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
15336𓀴shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
15337𓀴lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
15338𓀴the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
15339𓀴image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
15340𓀴knew too well.
15341𓀴
15342𓀴As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
15343𓀴turned to triumph.
15344𓀴
15345𓀴But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife.
15346𓀴I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
15347𓀴moment Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.
15348𓀴
15349𓀴It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
15350𓀴drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
15351𓀴our sight.
15352𓀴
15353𓀴I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
15354𓀴dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
15355𓀴could have imagined might have rested there.
15356𓀴
15357𓀴The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
15358𓀴of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
15359𓀴setting sun.
15360𓀴
15361𓀴The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
15362𓀴disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as
15363𓀴if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
15364𓀴leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,
15365𓀴which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
15366𓀴us alone.
15367𓀴
15368𓀴Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
15369𓀴hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
15370𓀴flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
15371𓀴two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
15372𓀴head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand
15373𓀴in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of
15374𓀴my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--
15375𓀴
15376𓀴“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he cried
15377𓀴suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, “It was
15378𓀴worth for this to die! Look! look!”
15379𓀴
15380𓀴The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
15381𓀴fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
15382𓀴the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from all
15383𓀴as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man
15384𓀴spoke:--
15385𓀴
15386𓀴“Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
15387𓀴more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”
15388𓀴
15389𓀴And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
15390𓀴gallant gentleman.

15395𓀴                                  NOTE
15396𓀴
15397𓀴
15398𓀴Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
15399𓀴some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
15400𓀴is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the same
15401𓀴day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
15402𓀴secret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into
15403𓀴him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
15404𓀴we call him Quincey.
15405𓀴
15406𓀴In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
15407𓀴over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
15408𓀴terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
15409𓀴which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
15410𓀴living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The
15411𓀴castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.
15412𓀴
15413𓀴When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
15414𓀴look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily
15415𓀴married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
15416𓀴our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the
15417𓀴mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
15418𓀴authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later
15419𓀴note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing’s memorandum.
15420𓀴We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
15421𓀴proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with
15422𓀴our boy on his knee:--
15423𓀴
15424𓀴“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day
15425𓀴know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her
15426𓀴sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so
15427𓀴loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”

15761𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
15762𓀴
15763𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
15764𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
15765𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
15766𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
15767𓀴from people in all walks of life.
15768𓀴
15769𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
15770𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
15771𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
15772𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
15773𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
15774𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
15775𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
15776𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
15777𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

15782𓀴501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
15783𓀴state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

15794𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
15795𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
15796𓀴
15797𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
15798𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
15799𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
15800𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
15801𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
15802𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
15803𓀴status with the IRS.
15804𓀴
15805𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
15806𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
15807𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
15808𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
15809𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
15810𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
15811𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
15812𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
15813𓀴
15814𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
15815𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
15816𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
15817𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
15818𓀴
15819𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
15820𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
15821𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
15822𓀴
15823𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
15824𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
15825𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
15826𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

15828𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
15829𓀴
15830𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
15831𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
15832𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
15833𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
15834𓀴volunteer support.
15835𓀴
15836𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
15837𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
15838𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
15839𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
15840𓀴edition.
15841𓀴
15842𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
15843𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
15844𓀴
15845𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
15846𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
15847𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
