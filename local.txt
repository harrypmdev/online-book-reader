47𓀴PREFACE TO THE BIOGRAPHICAL EDITION
48𓀴
49𓀴
50𓀴While my husband and Mr. Henley were engaged in writing plays in
51𓀴Bournemouth they made a number of titles, hoping to use them in the
52𓀴future. Dramatic composition was not what my husband preferred, but
53𓀴the torrent of Mr. Henley’s enthusiasm swept him off his feet. However,
54𓀴after several plays had been finished, and his health seriously impaired
55𓀴by his endeavours to keep up with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned
56𓀴forever, and my husband returned to his legitimate vocation. Having
57𓀴added one of the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected
58𓀴plays, now thrown aside, and emboldened by my husband’s offer to give me
59𓀴any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.
60𓀴
61𓀴As I wanted a trial scene in the Old Bailey, I chose the period of 1700
62𓀴for my purpose; but being shamefully ignorant of my subject, and my
63𓀴husband confessing to little more knowledge than I possessed, a London
64𓀴bookseller was commissioned to send us everything he could procure
65𓀴bearing on Old Bailey trials. A great package came in response to our
66𓀴order, and very soon we were both absorbed, not so much in the trials
67𓀴as in following the brilliant career of a Mr. Garrow, who appeared as
68𓀴counsel in many of the cases. We sent for more books, and yet more,
69𓀴still intent on Mr. Garrow, whose subtle cross-examination of witnesses
70𓀴and masterly, if sometimes startling, methods of arriving at the truth
71𓀴seemed more thrilling to us than any novel.
72𓀴
73𓀴Occasionally other trials than those of the Old Bailey would be included
74𓀴in the package of books we received from London; among these my husband
75𓀴found and read with avidity:--
76𓀴
77𓀴     THE
78𓀴     TRIAL
79𓀴     OF
80𓀴     JAMES STEWART
81𓀴     in Aucharn in Duror of Appin
82𓀴     FOR THE
83𓀴     Murder of COLIN CAMPBELL of Glenure, Efq;
84𓀴     Factor for His Majefty on the forfeited
85𓀴     Estate of Ardfhiel.
86𓀴
87𓀴My husband was always interested in this period of his country’s
88𓀴history, and had already the intention of writing a story that should
89𓀴turn on the Appin murder. The tale was to be of a boy, David Balfour,
90𓀴supposed to belong to my husband’s own family, who should travel in
91𓀴Scotland as though it were a foreign country, meeting with various
92𓀴adventures and misadventures by the way. From the trial of James Stewart
93𓀴my husband gleaned much valuable material for his novel, the most
94𓀴important being the character of Alan Breck. Aside from having described
95𓀴him as “smallish in stature,” my husband seems to have taken Alan
96𓀴Breck’s personal appearance, even to his clothing, from the book.
97𓀴
98𓀴A letter from James Stewart to Mr. John Macfarlane, introduced as
99𓀴evidence in the trial, says: “There is one Alan Stewart, a distant
100𓀴friend of the late Ardshiel’s, who is in the French service, and came
101𓀴over in March last, as he said to some, in order to settle at home; to
102𓀴others, that he was to go soon back; and was, as I hear, the day that
103𓀴the murder was committed, seen not far from the place where it happened,
104𓀴and is not now to be seen; by which it is believed he was the actor. He
105𓀴is a desperate foolish fellow; and if he is guilty, came to the country
106𓀴for that very purpose. He is a tall, pock-pitted lad, very black hair,
107𓀴and wore a blue coat and metal buttons, an old red vest, and breeches of
108𓀴the same colour.” A second witness testified to having seen him wearing
109𓀴“a blue coat with silver buttons, a red waistcoat, black shag breeches,
110𓀴tartan hose, and a feathered hat, with a big coat, dun coloured,” a
111𓀴costume referred to by one of the counsel as “French cloathes which were
112𓀴remarkable.”
113𓀴
114𓀴There are many incidents given in the trial that point to Alan’s fiery
115𓀴spirit and Highland quickness to take offence. One witness “declared
116𓀴also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would challenge
117𓀴Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his removing the
118𓀴declarant last year from Glenduror.” On another page: “Duncan Campbell,
119𓀴change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five years, married, witness cited,
120𓀴sworn, purged and examined ut supra, depones, That, in the month of
121𓀴April last, the deponent met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was
122𓀴not acquainted, and John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the
123𓀴walk miller of Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house: Alan
124𓀴Breck Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the
125𓀴deponent said, he had no reason for doing so: But Alan said, he had very
126𓀴good reason for it: that thereafter they left that house; and, after
127𓀴drinking a dram at another house, came to the deponent’s house, where
128𓀴they went in, and drunk some drams, and Alan Breck renewed the former
129𓀴Conversation; and the deponent, making the same answer, Alan said, that,
130𓀴if the deponent had any respect for his friends, he would tell them,
131𓀴that if they offered to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel’s estate, he
132𓀴would make black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by
133𓀴which the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase in
134𓀴the country.”
135𓀴
136𓀴Some time after the publication of Kidnapped we stopped for a short
137𓀴while in the Appin country, where we were surprised and interested to
138𓀴discover that the feeling concerning the murder of Glenure (the “Red
139𓀴Fox,” also called “Colin Roy”) was almost as keen as though the tragedy
140𓀴had taken place the day before. For several years my husband received
141𓀴letters of expostulation or commendation from members of the Campbell
142𓀴and Stewart clans. I have in my possession a paper, yellow with age,
143𓀴that was sent soon after the novel appeared, containing “The Pedigree of
144𓀴the Family of Appine,” wherein it is said that “Alan 3rd Baron of Appine
145𓀴was not killed at Flowdoun, tho there, but lived to a great old age. He
146𓀴married Cameron Daughter to Ewen Cameron of Lochiel.” Following this
147𓀴is a paragraph stating that “John Stewart 1st of Ardsheall of his
148𓀴descendants Alan Breck had better be omitted. Duncan Baan Stewart in
149𓀴Achindarroch his father was a Bastard.”
150𓀴
151𓀴One day, while my husband was busily at work, I sat beside him reading
152𓀴an old cookery book called The Compleat Housewife: or Accomplish’d
153𓀴Gentlewoman’s Companion. In the midst of receipts for “Rabbits, and
154𓀴Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, Skirret Pye, Baked Tansy,” and
155𓀴other forgotten delicacies, there were directions for the preparation
156𓀴of several lotions for the preservation of beauty. One of these was so
157𓀴charming that I interrupted my husband to read it aloud. “Just what
158𓀴I wanted!” he exclaimed; and the receipt for the “Lily of the Valley
159𓀴Water” was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.

166𓀴DEDICATION
167𓀴
168𓀴MY DEAR CHARLES BAXTER:
169𓀴
170𓀴
171𓀴If you ever read this tale, you will likely ask yourself more questions
172𓀴than I should care to answer: as for instance how the Appin murder has
173𓀴come to fall in the year 1751, how the Torran rocks have crept so near
174𓀴to Earraid, or why the printed trial is silent as to all that touches
175𓀴David Balfour. These are nuts beyond my ability to crack. But if you
176𓀴tried me on the point of Alan’s guilt or innocence, I think I could
177𓀴defend the reading of the text. To this day you will find the tradition
178𓀴of Appin clear in Alan’s favour. If you inquire, you may even hear that
179𓀴the descendants of “the other man” who fired the shot are in the country
180𓀴to this day. But that other man’s name, inquire as you please, you shall
181𓀴not hear; for the Highlander values a secret for itself and for the
182𓀴congenial exercise of keeping it. I might go on for long to justify one
183𓀴point and own another indefensible; it is more honest to confess at once
184𓀴how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy. This is no furniture
185𓀴for the scholar’s library, but a book for the winter evening school-room
186𓀴when the tasks are over and the hour for bed draws near; and honest
187𓀴Alan, who was a grim old fire-eater in his day has in this new avatar
188𓀴no more desperate purpose than to steal some young gentleman’s attention
189𓀴from his Ovid, carry him awhile into the Highlands and the last century,
190𓀴and pack him to bed with some engaging images to mingle with his dreams.
191𓀴
192𓀴As for you, my dear Charles, I do not even ask you to like this tale.
193𓀴But perhaps when he is older, your son will; he may then be pleased to
194𓀴find his father’s name on the fly-leaf; and in the meanwhile it pleases
195𓀴me to set it there, in memory of many days that were happy and some (now
196𓀴perhaps as pleasant to remember) that were sad. If it is strange for
197𓀴me to look back from a distance both in time and space on these bygone
198𓀴adventures of our youth, it must be stranger for you who tread the same
199𓀴streets--who may to-morrow open the door of the old Speculative,
200𓀴where we begin to rank with Scott and Robert Emmet and the beloved and
201𓀴inglorious Macbean--or may pass the corner of the close where that great
202𓀴society, the L. J. R., held its meetings and drank its beer, sitting in
203𓀴the seats of Burns and his companions. I think I see you, moving there
204𓀴by plain daylight, beholding with your natural eyes those places that
205𓀴have now become for your companion a part of the scenery of dreams. How,
206𓀴in the intervals of present business, the past must echo in your memory!
207𓀴Let it not echo often without some kind thoughts of your friend,
208𓀴
209𓀴R.L.S. SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH.

253𓀴CHAPTER I
254𓀴
255𓀴I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
256𓀴
257𓀴
258𓀴I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in
259𓀴the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the
260𓀴last time out of the door of my father’s house. The sun began to shine
261𓀴upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time
262𓀴I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the
263𓀴garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of
264𓀴the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.
265𓀴
266𓀴Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the
267𓀴garden gate, good man! He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing
268𓀴that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it
269𓀴kindly under his arm.
270𓀴
271𓀴“Well, Davie, lad,” said he, “I will go with you as far as the ford, to
272𓀴set you on the way.” And we began to walk forward in silence.
273𓀴
274𓀴“Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?” said he, after awhile.
275𓀴
276𓀴“Why, sir,” said I, “if I knew where I was going, or what was likely
277𓀴to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean is a good place
278𓀴indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been
279𓀴anywhere else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall
280𓀴be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to
281𓀴speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was
282𓀴going I would go with a good will.”
283𓀴
284𓀴“Ay?” said Mr. Campbell. “Very well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell
285𓀴your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your
286𓀴father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave
287𓀴me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. ‘So
288𓀴soon,’ says he, ‘as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear
289𓀴disposed of’ (all which, Davie, hath been done), ‘give my boy this
290𓀴letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far
291𓀴from Cramond. That is the place I came from,’ he said, ‘and it’s where
292𓀴it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,’ your father
293𓀴said, ‘and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well
294𓀴liked where he goes.’”
295𓀴
296𓀴“The house of Shaws!” I cried. “What had my poor father to do with the
297𓀴house of Shaws?”
298𓀴
299𓀴“Nay,” said Mr. Campbell, “who can tell that for a surety? But the name
300𓀴of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws:
301𓀴an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter
302𓀴days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his
303𓀴position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner
304𓀴or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember)
305𓀴I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and
306𓀴those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire,
307𓀴Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure
308𓀴in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before
309𓀴you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own
310𓀴hand of our departed brother.”
311𓀴
312𓀴He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands
313𓀴of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these
314𓀴will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard
315𓀴at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen
316𓀴years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of
317𓀴Ettrick.
318𓀴
319𓀴“Mr. Campbell,” I stammered, “and if you were in my shoes, would you
320𓀴go?”
321𓀴
322𓀴“Of a surety,” said the minister, “that would I, and without pause.
323𓀴A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by
324𓀴Edinburgh) in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and
325𓀴your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your
326𓀴blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back
327𓀴again and risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall
328𓀴be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything
329𓀴that I ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,” he
330𓀴resumed, “it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and
331𓀴set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world.”
332𓀴
333𓀴Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder
334𓀴under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long,
335𓀴serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks,
336𓀴put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There,
337𓀴then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a
338𓀴considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged
339𓀴upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done,
340𓀴he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I
341𓀴should conduct myself with its inhabitants.
342𓀴
343𓀴“Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial,” said he. “Bear ye this in
344𓀴mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae
345𓀴shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all
346𓀴these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect,
347𓀴as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the
348𓀴laird--remember he’s the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour.
349𓀴It’s a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young.”
350𓀴
351𓀴“Well, sir,” said I, “it may be; and I’ll promise you I’ll try to make
352𓀴it so.”
353𓀴
354𓀴“Why, very well said,” replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. “And now to come
355𓀴to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here
356𓀴a little packet which contains four things.” He tugged it, as he spoke,
357𓀴and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. “Of
358𓀴these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money
359𓀴for your father’s books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have
360𓀴explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to
361𓀴the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and
362𓀴myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round,
363𓀴will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie,
364𓀴it’s but a drop of water in the sea; it’ll help you but a step, and
365𓀴vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and
366𓀴written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the
367𓀴road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last,
368𓀴which is cubical, that’ll see you, it’s my prayerful wish, into a better
369𓀴land.”
370𓀴
371𓀴With that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little
372𓀴while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into
373𓀴the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard;
374𓀴then held me at arm’s length, looking at me with his face all working
375𓀴with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off
376𓀴backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run. It might
377𓀴have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh. I watched
378𓀴him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once
379𓀴looked back. Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow
380𓀴at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I,
381𓀴for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side,
382𓀴and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my
383𓀴own name and blood.
384𓀴
385𓀴“Davie, Davie,” I thought, “was ever seen such black ingratitude? Can
386𓀴you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name?
387𓀴Fie, fie; think shame.”
388𓀴
389𓀴And I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the
390𓀴parcel to see the nature of my gifts. That which he had called cubical,
391𓀴I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to
392𓀴carry in a plaid-neuk. That which he had called round, I found to be a
393𓀴shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both
394𓀴in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of
395𓀴coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:
396𓀴
397𓀴
398𓀴“TO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the
399𓀴valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is
400𓀴occasion. It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey. It is
401𓀴good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory;
402𓀴and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill
403𓀴of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which
404𓀴comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well,
405𓀴and whether man or woman.”
406𓀴
407𓀴
408𓀴
409𓀴And then, in the minister’s own hand, was added:
410𓀴
411𓀴“Likewise for sprains, rub it in; and for the cholic, a great spooneful
412𓀴in the hour.”
413𓀴
414𓀴
415𓀴To be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter;
416𓀴and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff’s end and set out over the
417𓀴ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the
418𓀴green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look
419𓀴of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the
420𓀴kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.
421𓀴
422𓀴
423𓀴
424𓀴
425𓀴CHAPTER II
426𓀴
427𓀴I COME TO MY JOURNEY’S END
428𓀴
429𓀴
430𓀴On the forenoon of the second day, coming to the top of a hill, I saw
431𓀴all the country fall away before me down to the sea; and in the midst
432𓀴of this descent, on a long ridge, the city of Edinburgh smoking like
433𓀴a kiln. There was a flag upon the castle, and ships moving or lying
434𓀴anchored in the firth; both of which, for as far away as they were, I
435𓀴could distinguish clearly; and both brought my country heart into my
436𓀴mouth.
437𓀴
438𓀴Presently after, I came by a house where a shepherd lived, and got a
439𓀴rough direction for the neighbourhood of Cramond; and so, from one to
440𓀴another, worked my way to the westward of the capital by Colinton, till
441𓀴I came out upon the Glasgow road. And there, to my great pleasure and
442𓀴wonder, I beheld a regiment marching to the fifes, every foot in time;
443𓀴an old red-faced general on a grey horse at the one end, and at the
444𓀴other the company of Grenadiers, with their Pope’s-hats. The pride of
445𓀴life seemed to mount into my brain at the sight of the red coats and the
446𓀴hearing of that merry music.
447𓀴
448𓀴A little farther on, and I was told I was in Cramond parish, and began
449𓀴to substitute in my inquiries the name of the house of Shaws. It was a
450𓀴word that seemed to surprise those of whom I sought my way. At first I
451𓀴thought the plainness of my appearance, in my country habit, and that
452𓀴all dusty from the road, consorted ill with the greatness of the place
453𓀴to which I was bound. But after two, or maybe three, had given me the
454𓀴same look and the same answer, I began to take it in my head there was
455𓀴something strange about the Shaws itself.
456𓀴
457𓀴The better to set this fear at rest, I changed the form of my inquiries;
458𓀴and spying an honest fellow coming along a lane on the shaft of his
459𓀴cart, I asked him if he had ever heard tell of a house they called the
460𓀴house of Shaws.
461𓀴
462𓀴He stopped his cart and looked at me, like the others.
463𓀴
464𓀴“Ay” said he. “What for?”
465𓀴
466𓀴“It’s a great house?” I asked.
467𓀴
468𓀴“Doubtless,” says he. “The house is a big, muckle house.”
469𓀴
470𓀴“Ay,” said I, “but the folk that are in it?”
471𓀴
472𓀴“Folk?” cried he. “Are ye daft? There’s nae folk there--to call folk.”
473𓀴
474𓀴“What?” say I; “not Mr. Ebenezer?”
475𓀴
476𓀴“Ou, ay” says the man; “there’s the laird, to be sure, if it’s him
477𓀴you’re wanting. What’ll like be your business, mannie?”
478𓀴
479𓀴“I was led to think that I would get a situation,” I said, looking as
480𓀴modest as I could.
481𓀴
482𓀴“What?” cries the carter, in so sharp a note that his very horse
483𓀴started; and then, “Well, mannie,” he added, “it’s nane of my affairs;
484𓀴but ye seem a decent-spoken lad; and if ye’ll take a word from me, ye’ll
485𓀴keep clear of the Shaws.”
486𓀴
487𓀴The next person I came across was a dapper little man in a beautiful
488𓀴white wig, whom I saw to be a barber on his rounds; and knowing well
489𓀴that barbers were great gossips, I asked him plainly what sort of a man
490𓀴was Mr. Balfour of the Shaws.
491𓀴
492𓀴“Hoot, hoot, hoot,” said the barber, “nae kind of a man, nae kind of a
493𓀴man at all;” and began to ask me very shrewdly what my business was;
494𓀴but I was more than a match for him at that, and he went on to his next
495𓀴customer no wiser than he came.
496𓀴
497𓀴I cannot well describe the blow this dealt to my illusions. The more
498𓀴indistinct the accusations were, the less I liked them, for they left
499𓀴the wider field to fancy. What kind of a great house was this, that all
500𓀴the parish should start and stare to be asked the way to it? or what
501𓀴sort of a gentleman, that his ill-fame should be thus current on the
502𓀴wayside? If an hour’s walking would have brought me back to Essendean, I
503𓀴had left my adventure then and there, and returned to Mr. Campbell’s.
504𓀴But when I had come so far a way already, mere shame would not suffer me
505𓀴to desist till I had put the matter to the touch of proof; I was bound,
506𓀴out of mere self-respect, to carry it through; and little as I liked
507𓀴the sound of what I heard, and slow as I began to travel, I still kept
508𓀴asking my way and still kept advancing.
509𓀴
510𓀴It was drawing on to sundown when I met a stout, dark, sour-looking
511𓀴woman coming trudging down a hill; and she, when I had put my usual
512𓀴question, turned sharp about, accompanied me back to the summit she had
513𓀴just left, and pointed to a great bulk of building standing very bare
514𓀴upon a green in the bottom of the next valley. The country was pleasant
515𓀴round about, running in low hills, pleasantly watered and wooded, and
516𓀴the crops, to my eyes, wonderfully good; but the house itself appeared
517𓀴to be a kind of ruin; no road led up to it; no smoke arose from any of
518𓀴the chimneys; nor was there any semblance of a garden. My heart sank.
519𓀴“That!” I cried.
520𓀴
521𓀴The woman’s face lit up with a malignant anger. “That is the house of
522𓀴Shaws!” she cried. “Blood built it; blood stopped the building of it;
523𓀴blood shall bring it down. See here!” she cried again--“I spit upon
524𓀴the ground, and crack my thumb at it! Black be its fall! If ye see the
525𓀴laird, tell him what ye hear; tell him this makes the twelve hunner and
526𓀴nineteen time that Jennet Clouston has called down the curse on him
527𓀴and his house, byre and stable, man, guest, and master, wife, miss, or
528𓀴bairn--black, black be their fall!”
529𓀴
530𓀴And the woman, whose voice had risen to a kind of eldritch sing-song,
531𓀴turned with a skip, and was gone. I stood where she left me, with my
532𓀴hair on end. In those days folk still believed in witches and trembled
533𓀴at a curse; and this one, falling so pat, like a wayside omen, to arrest
534𓀴me ere I carried out my purpose, took the pith out of my legs.
535𓀴
536𓀴I sat me down and stared at the house of Shaws. The more I looked,
537𓀴the pleasanter that country-side appeared; being all set with hawthorn
538𓀴bushes full of flowers; the fields dotted with sheep; a fine flight of
539𓀴rooks in the sky; and every sign of a kind soil and climate; and yet the
540𓀴barrack in the midst of it went sore against my fancy.
541𓀴
542𓀴Country folk went by from the fields as I sat there on the side of the
543𓀴ditch, but I lacked the spirit to give them a good-e’en. At last the sun
544𓀴went down, and then, right up against the yellow sky, I saw a scroll of
545𓀴smoke go mounting, not much thicker, as it seemed to me, than the smoke
546𓀴of a candle; but still there it was, and meant a fire, and warmth, and
547𓀴cookery, and some living inhabitant that must have lit it; and this
548𓀴comforted my heart.
549𓀴
550𓀴So I set forward by a little faint track in the grass that led in my
551𓀴direction. It was very faint indeed to be the only way to a place
552𓀴of habitation; yet I saw no other. Presently it brought me to stone
553𓀴uprights, with an unroofed lodge beside them, and coats of arms upon
554𓀴the top. A main entrance it was plainly meant to be, but never finished;
555𓀴instead of gates of wrought iron, a pair of hurdles were tied across
556𓀴with a straw rope; and as there were no park walls, nor any sign of
557𓀴avenue, the track that I was following passed on the right hand of the
558𓀴pillars, and went wandering on toward the house.
559𓀴
560𓀴The nearer I got to that, the drearier it appeared. It seemed like the
561𓀴one wing of a house that had never been finished. What should have been
562𓀴the inner end stood open on the upper floors, and showed against the sky
563𓀴with steps and stairs of uncompleted masonry. Many of the windows were
564𓀴unglazed, and bats flew in and out like doves out of a dove-cote.
565𓀴
566𓀴The night had begun to fall as I got close; and in three of the lower
567𓀴windows, which were very high up and narrow, and well barred, the
568𓀴changing light of a little fire began to glimmer. Was this the palace
569𓀴I had been coming to? Was it within these walls that I was to seek
570𓀴new friends and begin great fortunes? Why, in my father’s house on
571𓀴Essen-Waterside, the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away,
572𓀴and the door open to a beggar’s knock!
573𓀴
574𓀴I came forward cautiously, and giving ear as I came, heard some one
575𓀴rattling with dishes, and a little dry, eager cough that came in fits;
576𓀴but there was no sound of speech, and not a dog barked.
577𓀴
578𓀴The door, as well as I could see it in the dim light, was a great piece
579𓀴of wood all studded with nails; and I lifted my hand with a faint heart
580𓀴under my jacket, and knocked once. Then I stood and waited. The house
581𓀴had fallen into a dead silence; a whole minute passed away, and nothing
582𓀴stirred but the bats overhead. I knocked again, and hearkened again.
583𓀴By this time my ears had grown so accustomed to the quiet, that I
584𓀴could hear the ticking of the clock inside as it slowly counted out the
585𓀴seconds; but whoever was in that house kept deadly still, and must have
586𓀴held his breath.
587𓀴
588𓀴I was in two minds whether to run away; but anger got the upper hand,
589𓀴and I began instead to rain kicks and buffets on the door, and to shout
590𓀴out aloud for Mr. Balfour. I was in full career, when I heard the cough
591𓀴right overhead, and jumping back and looking up, beheld a man’s head
592𓀴in a tall nightcap, and the bell mouth of a blunderbuss, at one of the
593𓀴first-storey windows.
594𓀴
595𓀴“It’s loaded,” said a voice.
596𓀴
597𓀴“I have come here with a letter,” I said, “to Mr. Ebenezer Balfour of
598𓀴Shaws. Is he here?”
599𓀴
600𓀴“From whom is it?” asked the man with the blunderbuss.
601𓀴
602𓀴“That is neither here nor there,” said I, for I was growing very wroth.
603𓀴
604𓀴“Well,” was the reply, “ye can put it down upon the doorstep, and be off
605𓀴with ye.”
606𓀴
607𓀴“I will do no such thing,” I cried. “I will deliver it into Mr.
608𓀴Balfour’s hands, as it was meant I should. It is a letter of
609𓀴introduction.”
610𓀴
611𓀴“A what?” cried the voice, sharply.
612𓀴
613𓀴I repeated what I had said.
614𓀴
615𓀴“Who are ye, yourself?” was the next question, after a considerable
616𓀴pause.
617𓀴
618𓀴“I am not ashamed of my name,” said I. “They call me David Balfour.”
619𓀴
620𓀴At that, I made sure the man started, for I heard the blunderbuss rattle
621𓀴on the window-sill; and it was after quite a long pause, and with a
622𓀴curious change of voice, that the next question followed:
623𓀴
624𓀴“Is your father dead?”
625𓀴
626𓀴I was so much surprised at this, that I could find no voice to answer,
627𓀴but stood staring.
628𓀴
629𓀴“Ay,” the man resumed, “he’ll be dead, no doubt; and that’ll be what
630𓀴brings ye chapping to my door.” Another pause, and then defiantly,
631𓀴“Well, man,” he said, “I’ll let ye in;” and he disappeared from the
632𓀴window.
633𓀴
634𓀴
635𓀴
636𓀴
637𓀴CHAPTER III
638𓀴
639𓀴I MAKE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY UNCLE
640𓀴
641𓀴
642𓀴Presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts, and the
643𓀴door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as I had
644𓀴passed.
645𓀴
646𓀴“Go into the kitchen and touch naething,” said the voice; and while the
647𓀴person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door, I
648𓀴groped my way forward and entered the kitchen.
649𓀴
650𓀴The fire had burned up fairly bright, and showed me the barest room I
651𓀴think I ever put my eyes on. Half-a-dozen dishes stood upon the shelves;
652𓀴the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge, a horn spoon, and
653𓀴a cup of small beer. Besides what I have named, there was not another
654𓀴thing in that great, stone-vaulted, empty chamber but lockfast chests
655𓀴arranged along the wall and a corner cupboard with a padlock.
656𓀴
657𓀴As soon as the last chain was up, the man rejoined me. He was a mean,
658𓀴stooping, narrow-shouldered, clay-faced creature; and his age might have
659𓀴been anything between fifty and seventy. His nightcap was of flannel,
660𓀴and so was the nightgown that he wore, instead of coat and waistcoat,
661𓀴over his ragged shirt. He was long unshaved; but what most distressed
662𓀴and even daunted me, he would neither take his eyes away from me nor
663𓀴look me fairly in the face. What he was, whether by trade or birth, was
664𓀴more than I could fathom; but he seemed most like an old, unprofitable
665𓀴serving-man, who should have been left in charge of that big house upon
666𓀴board wages.
667𓀴
668𓀴“Are ye sharp-set?” he asked, glancing at about the level of my knee.
669𓀴“Ye can eat that drop parritch?”
670𓀴
671𓀴I said I feared it was his own supper.
672𓀴
673𓀴“O,” said he, “I can do fine wanting it. I’ll take the ale, though, for
674𓀴it slockens[1] my cough.” He drank the cup about half out, still
675𓀴keeping an eye upon me as he drank; and then suddenly held out his
676𓀴hand. “Let’s see the letter,” said he.
677𓀴
678𓀴    [1] moistens
679𓀴
680𓀴I told him the letter was for Mr. Balfour; not for him.
681𓀴
682𓀴“And who do ye think I am?” says he. “Give me Alexander’s letter.”
683𓀴
684𓀴“You know my father’s name?”
685𓀴
686𓀴“It would be strange if I didnae,” he returned, “for he was my born
687𓀴brother; and little as ye seem to like either me or my house, or my good
688𓀴parritch, I’m your born uncle, Davie, my man, and you my born nephew. So
689𓀴give us the letter, and sit down and fill your kyte.”
690𓀴
691𓀴If I had been some years younger, what with shame, weariness, and
692𓀴disappointment, I believe I had burst into tears. As it was, I could
693𓀴find no words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, and
694𓀴sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a
695𓀴young man had.
696𓀴
697𓀴Meanwhile, my uncle, stooping over the fire, turned the letter over and
698𓀴over in his hands.
699𓀴
700𓀴“Do ye ken what’s in it?” he asked, suddenly.
701𓀴
702𓀴“You see for yourself, sir,” said I, “that the seal has not been
703𓀴broken.”
704𓀴
705𓀴“Ay,” said he, “but what brought you here?”
706𓀴
707𓀴“To give the letter,” said I.
708𓀴
709𓀴“No,” says he, cunningly, “but ye’ll have had some hopes, nae doubt?”
710𓀴
711𓀴“I confess, sir,” said I, “when I was told that I had kinsfolk
712𓀴well-to-do, I did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in
713𓀴my life. But I am no beggar; I look for no favours at your hands, and
714𓀴I want none that are not freely given. For as poor as I appear, I have
715𓀴friends of my own that will be blithe to help me.”
716𓀴
717𓀴“Hoot-toot!” said Uncle Ebenezer, “dinnae fly up in the snuff at me.
718𓀴We’ll agree fine yet. And, Davie, my man, if you’re done with that bit
719𓀴parritch, I could just take a sup of it myself. Ay,” he continued,
720𓀴as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon, “they’re fine,
721𓀴halesome food--they’re grand food, parritch.” He murmured a little grace
722𓀴to himself and fell to. “Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind;
723𓀴he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never
724𓀴do mair than pyke at food.” He took a pull at the small beer, which
725𓀴probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran
726𓀴thus: “If ye’re dry ye’ll find water behind the door.”
727𓀴
728𓀴To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and
729𓀴looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart. He, on his part,
730𓀴continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time, and to throw
731𓀴out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun
732𓀴stockings. Once only, when he had ventured to look a little higher, our
733𓀴eyes met; and no thief taken with a hand in a man’s pocket could have
734𓀴shown more lively signals of distress. This set me in a muse, whether
735𓀴his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company; and
736𓀴whether perhaps, upon a little trial, it might pass off, and my uncle
737𓀴change into an altogether different man. From this I was awakened by his
738𓀴sharp voice.
739𓀴
740𓀴“Your father’s been long dead?” he asked.
741𓀴
742𓀴“Three weeks, sir,” said I.
743𓀴
744𓀴“He was a secret man, Alexander--a secret, silent man,” he continued.
745𓀴“He never said muckle when he was young. He’ll never have spoken muckle
746𓀴of me?”
747𓀴
748𓀴“I never knew, sir, till you told it me yourself, that he had any
749𓀴brother.”
750𓀴
751𓀴“Dear me, dear me!” said Ebenezer. “Nor yet of Shaws, I dare say?”
752𓀴
753𓀴“Not so much as the name, sir,” said I.
754𓀴
755𓀴“To think o’ that!” said he. “A strange nature of a man!” For all that,
756𓀴he seemed singularly satisfied, but whether with himself, or me, or
757𓀴with this conduct of my father’s, was more than I could read. Certainly,
758𓀴however, he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste, or ill-will, that he
759𓀴had conceived at first against my person; for presently he jumped up,
760𓀴came across the room behind me, and hit me a smack upon the shoulder.
761𓀴“We’ll agree fine yet!” he cried. “I’m just as glad I let you in. And
762𓀴now come awa’ to your bed.”
763𓀴
764𓀴To my surprise, he lit no lamp or candle, but set forth into the dark
765𓀴passage, groped his way, breathing deeply, up a flight of steps, and
766𓀴paused before a door, which he unlocked. I was close upon his heels,
767𓀴having stumbled after him as best I might; and then he bade me go in,
768𓀴for that was my chamber. I did as he bid, but paused after a few steps,
769𓀴and begged a light to go to bed with.
770𓀴
771𓀴“Hoot-toot!” said Uncle Ebenezer, “there’s a fine moon.”
772𓀴
773𓀴“Neither moon nor star, sir, and pit-mirk,”[2] said I. “I cannae see
774𓀴the bed.”
775𓀴
776𓀴     [2] Dark as the pit.
777𓀴
778𓀴“Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!” said he. “Lights in a house is a thing I dinnae
779𓀴agree with. I’m unco feared of fires. Good-night to ye, Davie, my man.”
780𓀴 And before I had time to add a further protest, he pulled the door to,
781𓀴and I heard him lock me in from the outside.
782𓀴
783𓀴I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The room was as cold as a well,
784𓀴and the bed, when I had found my way to it, as damp as a peat-hag; but
785𓀴by good fortune I had caught up my bundle and my plaid, and rolling
786𓀴myself in the latter, I lay down upon the floor under lee of the big
787𓀴bedstead, and fell speedily asleep.
788𓀴
789𓀴With the first peep of day I opened my eyes, to find myself in a great
790𓀴chamber, hung with stamped leather, furnished with fine embroidered
791𓀴furniture, and lit by three fair windows. Ten years ago, or perhaps
792𓀴twenty, it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in
793𓀴as a man could wish; but damp, dirt, disuse, and the mice and spiders
794𓀴had done their worst since then. Many of the window-panes, besides, were
795𓀴broken; and indeed this was so common a feature in that house, that I
796𓀴believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant
797𓀴neighbours--perhaps with Jennet Clouston at their head.
798𓀴
799𓀴Meanwhile the sun was shining outside; and being very cold in that
800𓀴miserable room, I knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me
801𓀴out. He carried me to the back of the house, where was a draw-well, and
802𓀴told me to “wash my face there, if I wanted;” and when that was done,
803𓀴I made the best of my own way back to the kitchen, where he had lit the
804𓀴fire and was making the porridge. The table was laid with two bowls and
805𓀴two horn spoons, but the same single measure of small beer. Perhaps my
806𓀴eye rested on this particular with some surprise, and perhaps my uncle
807𓀴observed it; for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought, asking me if
808𓀴I would like to drink ale--for so he called it.
809𓀴
810𓀴I told him such was my habit, but not to put himself about.
811𓀴
812𓀴“Na, na,” said he; “I’ll deny you nothing in reason.”
813𓀴
814𓀴He fetched another cup from the shelf; and then, to my great surprise,
815𓀴instead of drawing more beer, he poured an accurate half from one cup
816𓀴to the other. There was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath
817𓀴away; if my uncle was certainly a miser, he was one of that thorough
818𓀴breed that goes near to make the vice respectable.
819𓀴
820𓀴When we had made an end of our meal, my uncle Ebenezer unlocked a
821𓀴drawer, and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco, from which
822𓀴he cut one fill before he locked it up again. Then he sat down in the
823𓀴sun at one of the windows and silently smoked. From time to time his
824𓀴eyes came coasting round to me, and he shot out one of his questions.
825𓀴Once it was, “And your mother?” and when I had told him that she, too,
826𓀴was dead, “Ay, she was a bonnie lassie!” Then, after another long pause,
827𓀴“Whae were these friends o’ yours?”
828𓀴
829𓀴I told him they were different gentlemen of the name of Campbell;
830𓀴though, indeed, there was only one, and that the minister, that had ever
831𓀴taken the least note of me; but I began to think my uncle made too light
832𓀴of my position, and finding myself all alone with him, I did not wish
833𓀴him to suppose me helpless.
834𓀴
835𓀴He seemed to turn this over in his mind; and then, “Davie, my man,” said
836𓀴he, “ye’ve come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle Ebenezer.
837𓀴I’ve a great notion of the family, and I mean to do the right by you;
838𓀴but while I’m taking a bit think to mysel’ of what’s the best thing to
839𓀴put you to--whether the law, or the meenistry, or maybe the army, whilk
840𓀴is what boys are fondest of--I wouldnae like the Balfours to be humbled
841𓀴before a wheen Hieland Campbells, and I’ll ask you to keep your tongue
842𓀴within your teeth. Nae letters; nae messages; no kind of word to
843𓀴onybody; or else--there’s my door.”
844𓀴
845𓀴“Uncle Ebenezer,” said I, “I’ve no manner of reason to suppose you mean
846𓀴anything but well by me. For all that, I would have you to know that I
847𓀴have a pride of my own. It was by no will of mine that I came seeking
848𓀴you; and if you show me your door again, I’ll take you at the word.”
849𓀴
850𓀴He seemed grievously put out. “Hoots-toots,” said he, “ca’ cannie,
851𓀴man--ca’ cannie! Bide a day or two. I’m nae warlock, to find a fortune
852𓀴for you in the bottom of a parritch bowl; but just you give me a day or
853𓀴two, and say naething to naebody, and as sure as sure, I’ll do the right
854𓀴by you.”
855𓀴
856𓀴“Very well,” said I, “enough said. If you want to help me, there’s no
857𓀴doubt but I’ll be glad of it, and none but I’ll be grateful.”
858𓀴
859𓀴It seemed to me (too soon, I dare say) that I was getting the upper
860𓀴hand of my uncle; and I began next to say that I must have the bed and
861𓀴bedclothes aired and put to sun-dry; for nothing would make me sleep in
862𓀴such a pickle.
863𓀴
864𓀴“Is this my house or yours?” said he, in his keen voice, and then all of
865𓀴a sudden broke off. “Na, na,” said he, “I didnae mean that. What’s mine
866𓀴is yours, Davie, my man, and what’s yours is mine. Blood’s thicker than
867𓀴water; and there’s naebody but you and me that ought the name.” And
868𓀴then on he rambled about the family, and its ancient greatness, and his
869𓀴father that began to enlarge the house, and himself that stopped the
870𓀴building as a sinful waste; and this put it in my head to give him
871𓀴Jennet Clouston’s message.
872𓀴
873𓀴“The limmer!” he cried. “Twelve hunner and fifteen--that’s every day
874𓀴since I had the limmer rowpit![3] Dod, David, I’ll have her roasted on red
875𓀴peats before I’m by with it! A witch--a proclaimed witch! I’ll aff and
876𓀴see the session clerk.”
877𓀴
878𓀴     [3] Sold up.
879𓀴
880𓀴And with that he opened a chest, and got out a very old and
881𓀴well-preserved blue coat and waistcoat, and a good enough beaver hat,
882𓀴both without lace. These he threw on any way, and taking a staff from
883𓀴the cupboard, locked all up again, and was for setting out, when a
884𓀴thought arrested him.
885𓀴
886𓀴“I cannae leave you by yoursel’ in the house,” said he. “I’ll have to
887𓀴lock you out.”
888𓀴
889𓀴The blood came to my face. “If you lock me out,” I said, “it’ll be the
890𓀴last you’ll see of me in friendship.”
891𓀴
892𓀴He turned very pale, and sucked his mouth in.
893𓀴
894𓀴“This is no the way,” he said, looking wickedly at a corner of the
895𓀴floor--“this is no the way to win my favour, David.”
896𓀴
897𓀴“Sir,” says I, “with a proper reverence for your age and our common
898𓀴blood, I do not value your favour at a boddle’s purchase. I was brought
899𓀴up to have a good conceit of myself; and if you were all the uncle, and
900𓀴all the family, I had in the world ten times over, I wouldn’t buy your
901𓀴liking at such prices.”
902𓀴
903𓀴Uncle Ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile. I could
904𓀴see him all trembling and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he
905𓀴turned round, he had a smile upon his face.
906𓀴
907𓀴“Well, well,” said he, “we must bear and forbear. I’ll no go; that’s all
908𓀴that’s to be said of it.”
909𓀴
910𓀴“Uncle Ebenezer,” I said, “I can make nothing out of this. You use me
911𓀴like a thief; you hate to have me in this house; you let me see it,
912𓀴every word and every minute: it’s not possible that you can like me; and
913𓀴as for me, I’ve spoken to you as I never thought to speak to any man.
914𓀴Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back--let me gang back to
915𓀴the friends I have, and that like me!”
916𓀴
917𓀴“Na, na; na, na,” he said, very earnestly. “I like you fine; we’ll agree
918𓀴fine yet; and for the honour of the house I couldnae let you leave the
919𓀴way ye came. Bide here quiet, there’s a good lad; just you bide here
920𓀴quiet a bittie, and ye’ll find that we agree.”
921𓀴
922𓀴“Well, sir,” said I, after I had thought the matter out in silence,
923𓀴“I’ll stay awhile. It’s more just I should be helped by my own blood
924𓀴than strangers; and if we don’t agree, I’ll do my best it shall be
925𓀴through no fault of mine.”
926𓀴
927𓀴
928𓀴
929𓀴
930𓀴CHAPTER IV
931𓀴
932𓀴I RUN A GREAT DANGER IN THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
933𓀴
934𓀴
935𓀴For a day that was begun so ill, the day passed fairly well. We had the
936𓀴porridge cold again at noon, and hot porridge at night; porridge and
937𓀴small beer was my uncle’s diet. He spoke but little, and that in the
938𓀴same way as before, shooting a question at me after a long silence; and
939𓀴when I sought to lead him to talk about my future, slipped out of it
940𓀴again. In a room next door to the kitchen, where he suffered me to go,
941𓀴I found a great number of books, both Latin and English, in which I took
942𓀴great pleasure all the afternoon. Indeed, the time passed so lightly in
943𓀴this good company, that I began to be almost reconciled to my residence
944𓀴at Shaws; and nothing but the sight of my uncle, and his eyes playing
945𓀴hide and seek with mine, revived the force of my distrust.
946𓀴
947𓀴One thing I discovered, which put me in some doubt. This was an entry on
948𓀴the fly-leaf of a chap-book (one of Patrick Walker’s) plainly written
949𓀴by my father’s hand and thus conceived: “To my brother Ebenezer on his
950𓀴fifth birthday.” Now, what puzzled me was this: That, as my father was of
951𓀴course the younger brother, he must either have made some strange error,
952𓀴or he must have written, before he was yet five, an excellent, clear
953𓀴manly hand of writing.
954𓀴
955𓀴I tried to get this out of my head; but though I took down many
956𓀴interesting authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this
957𓀴notion of my father’s hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I
958𓀴went back into the kitchen, and sat down once more to porridge and small
959𓀴beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my
960𓀴father had not been very quick at his book.
961𓀴
962𓀴“Alexander? No him!” was the reply. “I was far quicker mysel’; I was a
963𓀴clever chappie when I was young. Why, I could read as soon as he could.”
964𓀴
965𓀴This puzzled me yet more; and a thought coming into my head, I asked if
966𓀴he and my father had been twins.
967𓀴
968𓀴He jumped upon his stool, and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon
969𓀴the floor. “What gars ye ask that?” he said, and he caught me by the
970𓀴breast of the jacket, and looked this time straight into my eyes:
971𓀴his own were little and light, and bright like a bird’s, blinking and
972𓀴winking strangely.
973𓀴
974𓀴“What do you mean?” I asked, very calmly, for I was far stronger than
975𓀴he, and not easily frightened. “Take your hand from my jacket. This is
976𓀴no way to behave.”
977𓀴
978𓀴My uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself. “Dod man, David,”
979𓀴 he said, “ye should-nae speak to me about your father. That’s where the
980𓀴mistake is.” He sat awhile and shook, blinking in his plate: “He was all
981𓀴the brother that ever I had,” he added, but with no heart in his voice;
982𓀴and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again, but still
983𓀴shaking.
984𓀴
985𓀴Now this last passage, this laying of hands upon my person and
986𓀴sudden profession of love for my dead father, went so clean beyond my
987𓀴comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope. On the one hand,
988𓀴I began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous;
989𓀴on the other, there came up into my mind (quite unbidden by me and even
990𓀴discouraged) a story like some ballad I had heard folk singing, of a
991𓀴poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried
992𓀴to keep him from his own. For why should my uncle play a part with a
993𓀴relative that came, almost a beggar, to his door, unless in his heart he
994𓀴had some cause to fear him?
995𓀴
996𓀴With this notion, all unacknowledged, but nevertheless getting firmly
997𓀴settled in my head, I now began to imitate his covert looks; so that
998𓀴we sat at table like a cat and a mouse, each stealthily observing the
999𓀴other. Not another word had he to say to me, black or white, but was
1000𓀴busy turning something secretly over in his mind; and the longer we
1001𓀴sat and the more I looked at him, the more certain I became that the
1002𓀴something was unfriendly to myself.
1003𓀴
1004𓀴When he had cleared the platter, he got out a single pipeful of tobacco,
1005𓀴just as in the morning, turned round a stool into the chimney corner,
1006𓀴and sat awhile smoking, with his back to me.
1007𓀴
1008𓀴“Davie,” he said, at length, “I’ve been thinking;” then he paused, and
1009𓀴said it again. “There’s a wee bit siller that I half promised ye before
1010𓀴ye were born,” he continued; “promised it to your father. O, naething
1011𓀴legal, ye understand; just gentlemen daffing at their wine. Well, I
1012𓀴keepit that bit money separate--it was a great expense, but a promise
1013𓀴is a promise--and it has grown by now to be a matter of just
1014𓀴precisely--just exactly”--and here he paused and stumbled--“of just
1015𓀴exactly forty pounds!” This last he rapped out with a sidelong glance
1016𓀴over his shoulder; and the next moment added, almost with a scream,
1017𓀴“Scots!”
1018𓀴
1019𓀴The pound Scots being the same thing as an English shilling, the
1020𓀴difference made by this second thought was considerable; I could see,
1021𓀴besides, that the whole story was a lie, invented with some end which
1022𓀴it puzzled me to guess; and I made no attempt to conceal the tone of
1023𓀴raillery in which I answered--
1024𓀴
1025𓀴“O, think again, sir! Pounds sterling, I believe!”
1026𓀴
1027𓀴“That’s what I said,” returned my uncle: “pounds sterling! And if you’ll
1028𓀴step out-by to the door a minute, just to see what kind of a night it
1029𓀴is, I’ll get it out to ye and call ye in again.”
1030𓀴
1031𓀴I did his will, smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think I
1032𓀴was so easily to be deceived. It was a dark night, with a few stars low
1033𓀴down; and as I stood just outside the door, I heard a hollow moaning
1034𓀴of wind far off among the hills. I said to myself there was something
1035𓀴thundery and changeful in the weather, and little knew of what a vast
1036𓀴importance that should prove to me before the evening passed.
1037𓀴
1038𓀴When I was called in again, my uncle counted out into my hand seven and
1039𓀴thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and
1040𓀴silver; but his heart failed him there, and he crammed the change into
1041𓀴his pocket.
1042𓀴
1043𓀴“There,” said he, “that’ll show you! I’m a queer man, and strange wi’
1044𓀴strangers; but my word is my bond, and there’s the proof of it.”
1045𓀴
1046𓀴Now, my uncle seemed so miserly that I was struck dumb by this sudden
1047𓀴generosity, and could find no words in which to thank him.
1048𓀴
1049𓀴“No a word!” said he. “Nae thanks; I want nae thanks. I do my duty. I’m
1050𓀴no saying that everybody would have done it; but for my part (though
1051𓀴I’m a careful body, too) it’s a pleasure to me to do the right by my
1052𓀴brother’s son; and it’s a pleasure to me to think that now we’ll agree
1053𓀴as such near friends should.”
1054𓀴
1055𓀴I spoke him in return as handsomely as I was able; but all the while
1056𓀴I was wondering what would come next, and why he had parted with his
1057𓀴precious guineas; for as to the reason he had given, a baby would have
1058𓀴refused it.
1059𓀴
1060𓀴Presently he looked towards me sideways.
1061𓀴
1062𓀴“And see here,” says he, “tit for tat.”
1063𓀴
1064𓀴I told him I was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree,
1065𓀴and then waited, looking for some monstrous demand. And yet, when
1066𓀴at last he plucked up courage to speak, it was only to tell me (very
1067𓀴properly, as I thought) that he was growing old and a little broken, and
1068𓀴that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden.
1069𓀴
1070𓀴I answered, and expressed my readiness to serve.
1071𓀴
1072𓀴“Well,” he said, “let’s begin.” He pulled out of his pocket a rusty key.
1073𓀴“There,” says he, “there’s the key of the stair-tower at the far end of
1074𓀴the house. Ye can only win into it from the outside, for that part of
1075𓀴the house is no finished. Gang ye in there, and up the stairs, and bring
1076𓀴me down the chest that’s at the top. There’s papers in’t,” he added.
1077𓀴
1078𓀴“Can I have a light, sir?” said I.
1079𓀴
1080𓀴“Na,” said he, very cunningly. “Nae lights in my house.”
1081𓀴
1082𓀴“Very well, sir,” said I. “Are the stairs good?”
1083𓀴
1084𓀴“They’re grand,” said he; and then, as I was going, “Keep to the wall,”
1085𓀴 he added; “there’s nae bannisters. But the stairs are grand underfoot.”
1086𓀴
1087𓀴Out I went into the night. The wind was still moaning in the distance,
1088𓀴though never a breath of it came near the house of Shaws. It had fallen
1089𓀴blacker than ever; and I was glad to feel along the wall, till I came
1090𓀴the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing.
1091𓀴I had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it, when all upon
1092𓀴a sudden, without sound of wind or thunder, the whole sky lighted up
1093𓀴with wild fire and went black again. I had to put my hand over my eyes
1094𓀴to get back to the colour of the darkness; and indeed I was already half
1095𓀴blinded when I stepped into the tower.
1096𓀴
1097𓀴It was so dark inside, it seemed a body could scarce breathe; but I
1098𓀴pushed out with foot and hand, and presently struck the wall with the
1099𓀴one, and the lowermost round of the stair with the other. The wall, by
1100𓀴the touch, was of fine hewn stone; the steps too, though somewhat steep
1101𓀴and narrow, were of polished masonwork, and regular and solid underfoot.
1102𓀴Minding my uncle’s word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower
1103𓀴side, and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.
1104𓀴
1105𓀴The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting
1106𓀴lofts. Well, as I advanced, it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a
1107𓀴thought more lightsome; and I was wondering what might be the cause of
1108𓀴this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went.
1109𓀴If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I
1110𓀴did not fall, it was more by Heaven’s mercy than my own strength. It was
1111𓀴not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the
1112𓀴wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but
1113𓀴the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length,
1114𓀴and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the
1115𓀴well.
1116𓀴
1117𓀴This was the grand stair! I thought; and with the thought, a gust of
1118𓀴a kind of angry courage came into my heart. My uncle had sent me here,
1119𓀴certainly to run great risks, perhaps to die. I swore I would settle
1120𓀴that “perhaps,” if I should break my neck for it; got me down upon my
1121𓀴hands and knees; and as slowly as a snail, feeling before me every
1122𓀴inch, and testing the solidity of every stone, I continued to ascend
1123𓀴the stair. The darkness, by contrast with the flash, appeared to have
1124𓀴redoubled; nor was that all, for my ears were now troubled and my mind
1125𓀴confounded by a great stir of bats in the top part of the tower, and the
1126𓀴foul beasts, flying downwards, sometimes beat about my face and body.
1127𓀴
1128𓀴The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step
1129𓀴was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights.
1130𓀴Well, I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward
1131𓀴as usual, my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness
1132𓀴beyond it. The stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger
1133𓀴mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death; and
1134𓀴(although, thanks to the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe
1135𓀴enough) the mere thought of the peril in which I might have stood, and
1136𓀴the dreadful height I might have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon
1137𓀴my body and relaxed my joints.
1138𓀴
1139𓀴But I knew what I wanted now, and turned and groped my way down again,
1140𓀴with a wonderful anger in my heart. About half-way down, the wind sprang
1141𓀴up in a clap and shook the tower, and died again; the rain followed; and
1142𓀴before I had reached the ground level it fell in buckets. I put out my
1143𓀴head into the storm, and looked along towards the kitchen. The door,
1144𓀴which I had shut behind me when I left, now stood open, and shed a
1145𓀴little glimmer of light; and I thought I could see a figure standing
1146𓀴in the rain, quite still, like a man hearkening. And then there came
1147𓀴a blinding flash, which showed me my uncle plainly, just where I had
1148𓀴fancied him to stand; and hard upon the heels of it, a great tow-row of
1149𓀴thunder.
1150𓀴
1151𓀴Now, whether my uncle thought the crash to be the sound of my fall, or
1152𓀴whether he heard in it God’s voice denouncing murder, I will leave you
1153𓀴to guess. Certain it is, at least, that he was seized on by a kind of
1154𓀴panic fear, and that he ran into the house and left the door open behind
1155𓀴him. I followed as softly as I could, and, coming unheard into the
1156𓀴kitchen, stood and watched him.
1157𓀴
1158𓀴He had found time to open the corner cupboard and bring out a great case
1159𓀴bottle of aqua vitae, and now sat with his back towards me at the table.
1160𓀴Ever and again he would be seized with a fit of deadly shuddering and
1161𓀴groan aloud, and carrying the bottle to his lips, drink down the raw
1162𓀴spirits by the mouthful.
1163𓀴
1164𓀴I stepped forward, came close behind him where he sat, and suddenly
1165𓀴clapping my two hands down upon his shoulders--“Ah!” cried I.
1166𓀴
1167𓀴My uncle gave a kind of broken cry like a sheep’s bleat, flung up his
1168𓀴arms, and tumbled to the floor like a dead man. I was somewhat shocked
1169𓀴at this; but I had myself to look to first of all, and did not hesitate
1170𓀴to let him lie as he had fallen. The keys were hanging in the cupboard;
1171𓀴and it was my design to furnish myself with arms before my uncle should
1172𓀴come again to his senses and the power of devising evil. In the cupboard
1173𓀴were a few bottles, some apparently of medicine; a great many bills and
1174𓀴other papers, which I should willingly enough have rummaged, had I had
1175𓀴the time; and a few necessaries that were nothing to my purpose. Thence
1176𓀴I turned to the chests. The first was full of meal; the second of
1177𓀴moneybags and papers tied into sheaves; in the third, with many
1178𓀴other things (and these for the most part clothes) I found a rusty,
1179𓀴ugly-looking Highland dirk without the scabbard. This, then, I concealed
1180𓀴inside my waistcoat, and turned to my uncle.
1181𓀴
1182𓀴He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm
1183𓀴sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed
1184𓀴to have ceased breathing. Fear came on me that he was dead; then I
1185𓀴got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a
1186𓀴little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids. At last
1187𓀴he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was
1188𓀴not of this world.
1189𓀴
1190𓀴“Come, come,” said I; “sit up.”
1191𓀴
1192𓀴“Are ye alive?” he sobbed. “O man, are ye alive?”
1193𓀴
1194𓀴“That am I,” said I. “Small thanks to you!”
1195𓀴
1196𓀴He had begun to seek for his breath with deep sighs. “The blue phial,”
1197𓀴 said he--“in the aumry--the blue phial.” His breath came slower still.
1198𓀴
1199𓀴I ran to the cupboard, and, sure enough, found there a blue phial
1200𓀴of medicine, with the dose written on it on a paper, and this I
1201𓀴administered to him with what speed I might.
1202𓀴
1203𓀴“It’s the trouble,” said he, reviving a little; “I have a trouble,
1204𓀴Davie. It’s the heart.”
1205𓀴
1206𓀴I set him on a chair and looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for
1207𓀴a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger;
1208𓀴and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation:
1209𓀴why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him;
1210𓀴why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--“Is
1211𓀴that because it is true?” I asked; why he had given me money to which I
1212𓀴was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill
1213𓀴me. He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice,
1214𓀴begged me to let him go to bed.
1215𓀴
1216𓀴“I’ll tell ye the morn,” he said; “as sure as death I will.”
1217𓀴
1218𓀴And so weak was he that I could do nothing but consent. I locked him
1219𓀴into his room, however, and pocketed the key, and then returning to
1220𓀴the kitchen, made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long
1221𓀴year, and wrapping myself in my plaid, lay down upon the chests and fell
1222𓀴asleep.
1223𓀴
1224𓀴
1225𓀴
1226𓀴
1227𓀴CHAPTER V
1228𓀴
1229𓀴I GO TO THE QUEEN’S FERRY
1230𓀴
1231𓀴
1232𓀴Much rain fell in the night; and the next morning there blew a bitter
1233𓀴wintry wind out of the north-west, driving scattered clouds. For all
1234𓀴that, and before the sun began to peep or the last of the stars had
1235𓀴vanished, I made my way to the side of the burn, and had a plunge in a
1236𓀴deep whirling pool. All aglow from my bath, I sat down once more
1237𓀴beside the fire, which I replenished, and began gravely to consider my
1238𓀴position.
1239𓀴
1240𓀴There was now no doubt about my uncle’s enmity; there was no doubt I
1241𓀴carried my life in my hand, and he would leave no stone unturned that
1242𓀴he might compass my destruction. But I was young and spirited, and
1243𓀴like most lads that have been country-bred, I had a great opinion of my
1244𓀴shrewdness. I had come to his door no better than a beggar and little
1245𓀴more than a child; he had met me with treachery and violence; it would
1246𓀴be a fine consummation to take the upper hand, and drive him like a herd
1247𓀴of sheep.
1248𓀴
1249𓀴I sat there nursing my knee and smiling at the fire; and I saw myself in
1250𓀴fancy smell out his secrets one after another, and grow to be that man’s
1251𓀴king and ruler. The warlock of Essendean, they say, had made a mirror in
1252𓀴which men could read the future; it must have been of other stuff than
1253𓀴burning coal; for in all the shapes and pictures that I sat and gazed
1254𓀴at, there was never a ship, never a seaman with a hairy cap, never a big
1255𓀴bludgeon for my silly head, or the least sign of all those tribulations
1256𓀴that were ripe to fall on me.
1257𓀴
1258𓀴Presently, all swollen with conceit, I went up-stairs and gave my
1259𓀴prisoner his liberty. He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave the
1260𓀴same to him, smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency.
1261𓀴Soon we were set to breakfast, as it might have been the day before.
1262𓀴
1263𓀴“Well, sir,” said I, with a jeering tone, “have you nothing more to say
1264𓀴to me?” And then, as he made no articulate reply, “It will be time,
1265𓀴I think, to understand each other,” I continued. “You took me for
1266𓀴a country Johnnie Raw, with no more mother-wit or courage than a
1267𓀴porridge-stick. I took you for a good man, or no worse than others at
1268𓀴the least. It seems we were both wrong. What cause you have to fear me,
1269𓀴to cheat me, and to attempt my life--”
1270𓀴
1271𓀴He murmured something about a jest, and that he liked a bit of fun; and
1272𓀴then, seeing me smile, changed his tone, and assured me he would make
1273𓀴all clear as soon as we had breakfasted. I saw by his face that he had
1274𓀴no lie ready for me, though he was hard at work preparing one; and I
1275𓀴think I was about to tell him so, when we were interrupted by a knocking
1276𓀴at the door.
1277𓀴
1278𓀴Bidding my uncle sit where he was, I went to open it, and found on the
1279𓀴doorstep a half-grown boy in sea-clothes. He had no sooner seen me than
1280𓀴he began to dance some steps of the sea-hornpipe (which I had never
1281𓀴before heard of far less seen), snapping his fingers in the air and
1282𓀴footing it right cleverly. For all that, he was blue with the cold; and
1283𓀴there was something in his face, a look between tears and laughter, that
1284𓀴was highly pathetic and consisted ill with this gaiety of manner.
1285𓀴
1286𓀴“What cheer, mate?” says he, with a cracked voice.
1287𓀴
1288𓀴I asked him soberly to name his pleasure.
1289𓀴
1290𓀴“O, pleasure!” says he; and then began to sing:
1291𓀴
1292𓀴     “For it’s my delight, of a shiny night,
1293𓀴     In the season of the year.”
1294𓀴
1295𓀴“Well,” said I, “if you have no business at all, I will even be so
1296𓀴unmannerly as to shut you out.”
1297𓀴
1298𓀴“Stay, brother!” he cried. “Have you no fun about you? or do you want
1299𓀴to get me thrashed? I’ve brought a letter from old Heasyoasy to Mr.
1300𓀴Belflower.” He showed me a letter as he spoke. “And I say, mate,” he
1301𓀴added, “I’m mortal hungry.”
1302𓀴
1303𓀴“Well,” said I, “come into the house, and you shall have a bite if I go
1304𓀴empty for it.”
1305𓀴
1306𓀴With that I brought him in and set him down to my own place, where he
1307𓀴fell-to greedily on the remains of breakfast, winking to me between
1308𓀴whiles, and making many faces, which I think the poor soul considered
1309𓀴manly. Meanwhile, my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking; then,
1310𓀴suddenly, he got to his feet with a great air of liveliness, and pulled
1311𓀴me apart into the farthest corner of the room.
1312𓀴
1313𓀴“Read that,” said he, and put the letter in my hand.
1314𓀴
1315𓀴Here it is, lying before me as I write:
1316𓀴
1317𓀴“The Hawes Inn, at the Queen’s Ferry.
1318𓀴
1319𓀴“Sir,--I lie here with my hawser up and down, and send my cabin-boy to
1320𓀴informe. If you have any further commands for over-seas, to-day will be
1321𓀴the last occasion, as the wind will serve us well out of the firth.
1322𓀴I will not seek to deny that I have had crosses with your doer,[4] Mr.
1323𓀴Rankeillor; of which, if not speedily redd up, you may looke to see some
1324𓀴losses follow. I have drawn a bill upon you, as per margin, and am, sir,
1325𓀴     your most obedt., humble servant,
1326𓀴
1327𓀴                                       “ELIAS HOSEASON.”
1328𓀴
1329𓀴[4] Agent.
1330𓀴
1331𓀴“You see, Davie,” resumed my uncle, as soon as he saw that I had done,
1332𓀴“I have a venture with this man Hoseason, the captain of a trading brig,
1333𓀴the _Covenant_, of Dysart. Now, if you and me was to walk over with
1334𓀴yon lad, I could see the captain at the Hawes, or maybe on board the
1335𓀴_Covenant_ if there was papers to be signed; and so far from a loss of
1336𓀴time, we can jog on to the lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor’s. After a’ that’s
1337𓀴come and gone, ye would be swier[5] to believe me upon my naked word; but
1338𓀴ye’ll believe Rankeillor. He’s factor to half the gentry in these parts;
1339𓀴an auld man, forby: highly respeckit, and he kenned your father.”
1340𓀴
1341𓀴     [5] Unwilling.
1342𓀴
1343𓀴I stood awhile and thought. I was going to some place of shipping, which
1344𓀴was doubtless populous, and where my uncle durst attempt no violence,
1345𓀴and, indeed, even the society of the cabin-boy so far protected me. Once
1346𓀴there, I believed I could force on the visit to the lawyer, even if my
1347𓀴uncle were now insincere in proposing it; and, perhaps, in the bottom
1348𓀴of my heart, I wished a nearer view of the sea and ships. You are to
1349𓀴remember I had lived all my life in the inland hills, and just two days
1350𓀴before had my first sight of the firth lying like a blue floor, and the
1351𓀴sailed ships moving on the face of it, no bigger than toys. One thing
1352𓀴with another, I made up my mind.
1353𓀴
1354𓀴“Very well,” says I, “let us go to the Ferry.”
1355𓀴
1356𓀴My uncle got into his hat and coat, and buckled an old rusty cutlass on;
1357𓀴and then we trod the fire out, locked the door, and set forth upon our
1358𓀴walk.
1359𓀴
1360𓀴The wind, being in that cold quarter the north-west, blew nearly in our
1361𓀴faces as we went. It was the month of June; the grass was all white with
1362𓀴daisies, and the trees with blossom; but, to judge by our blue nails
1363𓀴and aching wrists, the time might have been winter and the whiteness a
1364𓀴December frost.
1365𓀴
1366𓀴Uncle Ebenezer trudged in the ditch, jogging from side to side like an
1367𓀴old ploughman coming home from work. He never said a word the whole
1368𓀴way; and I was thrown for talk on the cabin-boy. He told me his name was
1369𓀴Ransome, and that he had followed the sea since he was nine, but could
1370𓀴not say how old he was, as he had lost his reckoning. He showed me
1371𓀴tattoo marks, baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite
1372𓀴of my remonstrances, for I thought it was enough to kill him; he swore
1373𓀴horribly whenever he remembered, but more like a silly schoolboy than a
1374𓀴man; and boasted of many wild and bad things that he had done: stealthy
1375𓀴thefts, false accusations, ay, and even murder; but all with such a
1376𓀴dearth of likelihood in the details, and such a weak and crazy swagger
1377𓀴in the delivery, as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him.
1378𓀴
1379𓀴I asked him of the brig (which he declared was the finest ship that
1380𓀴sailed) and of Captain Hoseason, in whose praises he was equally loud.
1381𓀴Heasyoasy (for so he still named the skipper) was a man, by his account,
1382𓀴that minded for nothing either in heaven or earth; one that, as people
1383𓀴said, would “crack on all sail into the day of judgment;” rough, fierce,
1384𓀴unscrupulous, and brutal; and all this my poor cabin-boy had taught
1385𓀴himself to admire as something seamanlike and manly. He would only admit
1386𓀴one flaw in his idol. “He ain’t no seaman,” he admitted. “That’s Mr.
1387𓀴Shuan that navigates the brig; he’s the finest seaman in the trade, only
1388𓀴for drink; and I tell you I believe it! Why, look’ere;” and turning down
1389𓀴his stocking he showed me a great, raw, red wound that made my blood run
1390𓀴cold. “He done that--Mr. Shuan done it,” he said, with an air of pride.
1391𓀴
1392𓀴“What!” I cried, “do you take such savage usage at his hands? Why, you
1393𓀴are no slave, to be so handled!”
1394𓀴
1395𓀴“No,” said the poor moon-calf, changing his tune at once, “and so he’ll
1396𓀴find. See’ere;” and he showed me a great case-knife, which he told me
1397𓀴was stolen. “O,” says he, “let me see him try; I dare him to; I’ll do
1398𓀴for him! O, he ain’t the first!” And he confirmed it with a poor, silly,
1399𓀴ugly oath.
1400𓀴
1401𓀴I have never felt such pity for any one in this wide world as I felt for
1402𓀴that half-witted creature, and it began to come over me that the brig
1403𓀴_Covenant_ (for all her pious name) was little better than a hell upon
1404𓀴the seas.
1405𓀴
1406𓀴“Have you no friends?” said I.
1407𓀴
1408𓀴He said he had a father in some English seaport, I forget which.
1409𓀴
1410𓀴“He was a fine man, too,” he said, “but he’s dead.”
1411𓀴
1412𓀴“In Heaven’s name,” cried I, “can you find no reputable life on shore?”
1413𓀴
1414𓀴“O, no,” says he, winking and looking very sly, “they would put me to a
1415𓀴trade. I know a trick worth two of that, I do!”
1416𓀴
1417𓀴I asked him what trade could be so dreadful as the one he followed,
1418𓀴where he ran the continual peril of his life, not alone from wind and
1419𓀴sea, but by the horrid cruelty of those who were his masters. He said
1420𓀴it was very true; and then began to praise the life, and tell what a
1421𓀴pleasure it was to get on shore with money in his pocket, and spend it
1422𓀴like a man, and buy apples, and swagger, and surprise what he called
1423𓀴stick-in-the-mud boys. “And then it’s not all as bad as that,” says he;
1424𓀴“there’s worse off than me: there’s the twenty-pounders. O, laws!
1425𓀴you should see them taking on. Why, I’ve seen a man as old as you, I
1426𓀴dessay”--(to him I seemed old)--“ah, and he had a beard, too--well, and
1427𓀴as soon as we cleared out of the river, and he had the drug out of his
1428𓀴head--my! how he cried and carried on! I made a fine fool of him, I tell
1429𓀴you! And then there’s little uns, too: oh, little by me! I tell you, I
1430𓀴keep them in order. When we carry little uns, I have a rope’s end of
1431𓀴my own to wollop’em.” And so he ran on, until it came in on me what
1432𓀴he meant by twenty-pounders were those unhappy criminals who were
1433𓀴sent over-seas to slavery in North America, or the still more unhappy
1434𓀴innocents who were kidnapped or trepanned (as the word went) for private
1435𓀴interest or vengeance.
1436𓀴
1437𓀴Just then we came to the top of the hill, and looked down on the Ferry
1438𓀴and the Hope. The Firth of Forth (as is very well known) narrows at this
1439𓀴point to the width of a good-sized river, which makes a convenient ferry
1440𓀴going north, and turns the upper reach into a landlocked haven for all
1441𓀴manner of ships. Right in the midst of the narrows lies an islet with
1442𓀴some ruins; on the south shore they have built a pier for the service
1443𓀴of the Ferry; and at the end of the pier, on the other side of the road,
1444𓀴and backed against a pretty garden of holly-trees and hawthorns, I could
1445𓀴see the building which they called the Hawes Inn.
1446𓀴
1447𓀴The town of Queensferry lies farther west, and the neighbourhood of the
1448𓀴inn looked pretty lonely at that time of day, for the boat had just
1449𓀴gone north with passengers. A skiff, however, lay beside the pier, with
1450𓀴some seamen sleeping on the thwarts; this, as Ransome told me, was the
1451𓀴brig’s boat waiting for the captain; and about half a mile off, and all
1452𓀴alone in the anchorage, he showed me the _Covenant_ herself. There was
1453𓀴a sea-going bustle on board; yards were swinging into place; and as the
1454𓀴wind blew from that quarter, I could hear the song of the sailors as
1455𓀴they pulled upon the ropes. After all I had listened to upon the way, I
1456𓀴looked at that ship with an extreme abhorrence; and from the bottom of
1457𓀴my heart I pitied all poor souls that were condemned to sail in her.
1458𓀴
1459𓀴We had all three pulled up on the brow of the hill; and now I marched
1460𓀴across the road and addressed my uncle. “I think it right to tell
1461𓀴you, sir,” says I, “there’s nothing that will bring me on board that
1462𓀴_Covenant_.”
1463𓀴
1464𓀴He seemed to waken from a dream. “Eh?” he said. “What’s that?”
1465𓀴
1466𓀴I told him over again.
1467𓀴
1468𓀴“Well, well,” he said, “we’ll have to please ye, I suppose. But what
1469𓀴are we standing here for? It’s perishing cold; and if I’m no mistaken,
1470𓀴they’re busking the _Covenant_ for sea.”

1475𓀴CHAPTER VI
1476𓀴
1477𓀴WHAT BEFELL AT THE QUEEN’S FERRY
1478𓀴
1479𓀴
1480𓀴As soon as we came to the inn, Ransome led us up the stair to a small
1481𓀴room, with a bed in it, and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal.
1482𓀴At a table hard by the chimney, a tall, dark, sober-looking man sat
1483𓀴writing. In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket,
1484𓀴buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet
1485𓀴I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or
1486𓀴more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain.
1487𓀴
1488𓀴He got to his feet at once, and coming forward, offered his large hand
1489𓀴to Ebenezer. “I am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour,” said he, in a fine
1490𓀴deep voice, “and glad that ye are here in time. The wind’s fair, and the
1491𓀴tide upon the turn; we’ll see the old coal-bucket burning on the Isle of
1492𓀴May before to-night.”
1493𓀴
1494𓀴“Captain Hoseason,” returned my uncle, “you keep your room unco hot.”
1495𓀴
1496𓀴“It’s a habit I have, Mr. Balfour,” said the skipper. “I’m a cold-rife
1497𓀴man by my nature; I have a cold blood, sir. There’s neither fur,
1498𓀴nor flannel--no, sir, nor hot rum, will warm up what they call
1499𓀴the temperature. Sir, it’s the same with most men that have been
1500𓀴carbonadoed, as they call it, in the tropic seas.”
1501𓀴
1502𓀴“Well, well, captain,” replied my uncle, “we must all be the way we’re
1503𓀴made.”
1504𓀴
1505𓀴But it chanced that this fancy of the captain’s had a great share in my
1506𓀴misfortunes. For though I had promised myself not to let my kinsman out
1507𓀴of sight, I was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea, and
1508𓀴so sickened by the closeness of the room, that when he told me to “run
1509𓀴down-stairs and play myself awhile,” I was fool enough to take him at
1510𓀴his word.
1511𓀴
1512𓀴Away I went, therefore, leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle
1513𓀴and a great mass of papers; and crossing the road in front of the inn,
1514𓀴walked down upon the beach. With the wind in that quarter, only little
1515𓀴wavelets, not much bigger than I had seen upon a lake, beat upon the
1516𓀴shore. But the weeds were new to me--some green, some brown and long,
1517𓀴and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers. Even so
1518𓀴far up the firth, the smell of the sea-water was exceedingly salt and
1519𓀴stirring; the _Covenant_, besides, was beginning to shake out her
1520𓀴sails, which hung upon the yards in clusters; and the spirit of all
1521𓀴that I beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places.
1522𓀴
1523𓀴I looked, too, at the seamen with the skiff--big brown fellows, some in
1524𓀴shirts, some with jackets, some with coloured handkerchiefs about their
1525𓀴throats, one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or
1526𓀴three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives. I passed
1527𓀴the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows,
1528𓀴and asked him of the sailing of the brig. He said they would get under
1529𓀴way as soon as the ebb set, and expressed his gladness to be out of
1530𓀴a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers; but all with such
1531𓀴horrifying oaths, that I made haste to get away from him.
1532𓀴
1533𓀴This threw me back on Ransome, who seemed the least wicked of that gang,
1534𓀴and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me, crying for a bowl of
1535𓀴punch. I told him I would give him no such thing, for neither he nor I
1536𓀴was of an age for such indulgences. “But a glass of ale you may have,
1537𓀴and welcome,” said I. He mopped and mowed at me, and called me names;
1538𓀴but he was glad to get the ale, for all that; and presently we were
1539𓀴set down at a table in the front room of the inn, and both eating and
1540𓀴drinking with a good appetite.
1541𓀴
1542𓀴Here it occurred to me that, as the landlord was a man of that county,
1543𓀴I might do well to make a friend of him. I offered him a share, as was
1544𓀴much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit
1545𓀴with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the
1546𓀴room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor.
1547𓀴
1548𓀴“Hoot, ay,” says he, “and a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,” says
1549𓀴he, “was it you that came in with Ebenezer?” And when I had told him
1550𓀴yes, “Ye’ll be no friend of his?” he asked, meaning, in the Scottish
1551𓀴way, that I would be no relative.
1552𓀴
1553𓀴I told him no, none.
1554𓀴
1555𓀴“I thought not,” said he, “and yet ye have a kind of gliff[6] of Mr.
1556𓀴Alexander.”
1557𓀴
1558𓀴     [6] Look.
1559𓀴
1560𓀴I said it seemed that Ebenezer was ill-seen in the country.
1561𓀴
1562𓀴“Nae doubt,” said the landlord. “He’s a wicked auld man, and there’s
1563𓀴many would like to see him girning in the tow.[7] Jennet Clouston and mony
1564𓀴mair that he has harried out of house and hame. And yet he was ance
1565𓀴a fine young fellow, too. But that was before the sough[8] gaed abroad
1566𓀴about Mr. Alexander, that was like the death of him.”
1567𓀴
1568𓀴     [7] Rope.
1569𓀴
1570𓀴     [8] Report.
1571𓀴
1572𓀴“And what was it?” I asked.
1573𓀴
1574𓀴“Ou, just that he had killed him,” said the landlord. “Did ye never hear
1575𓀴that?”
1576𓀴
1577𓀴“And what would he kill him for?” said I.
1578𓀴
1579𓀴“And what for, but just to get the place,” said he.
1580𓀴
1581𓀴“The place?” said I. “The Shaws?”
1582𓀴
1583𓀴“Nae other place that I ken,” said he.
1584𓀴
1585𓀴“Ay, man?” said I. “Is that so? Was my--was Alexander the eldest son?”
1586𓀴
1587𓀴“‘Deed was he,” said the landlord. “What else would he have killed him
1588𓀴for?”
1589𓀴
1590𓀴And with that he went away, as he had been impatient to do from the
1591𓀴beginning.
1592𓀴
1593𓀴Of course, I had guessed it a long while ago; but it is one thing to
1594𓀴guess, another to know; and I sat stunned with my good fortune, and
1595𓀴could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in
1596𓀴the dust from Ettrick Forest not two days ago, was now one of the rich
1597𓀴of the earth, and had a house and broad lands, and might mount his horse
1598𓀴tomorrow. All these pleasant things, and a thousand others, crowded into
1599𓀴my mind, as I sat staring before me out of the inn window, and paying
1600𓀴no heed to what I saw; only I remember that my eye lighted on Captain
1601𓀴Hoseason down on the pier among his seamen, and speaking with some
1602𓀴authority. And presently he came marching back towards the house, with
1603𓀴no mark of a sailor’s clumsiness, but carrying his fine, tall figure
1604𓀴with a manly bearing, and still with the same sober, grave expression on
1605𓀴his face. I wondered if it was possible that Ransome’s stories could
1606𓀴be true, and half disbelieved them; they fitted so ill with the man’s
1607𓀴looks. But indeed, he was neither so good as I supposed him, nor quite
1608𓀴so bad as Ransome did; for, in fact, he was two men, and left the better
1609𓀴one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel.
1610𓀴
1611𓀴The next thing, I heard my uncle calling me, and found the pair in the
1612𓀴road together. It was the captain who addressed me, and that with an air
1613𓀴(very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.
1614𓀴
1615𓀴“Sir,” said he, “Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my
1616𓀴own part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might
1617𓀴make the better friends; but we’ll make the most of what we have. Ye
1618𓀴shall come on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and
1619𓀴drink a bowl with me.”
1620𓀴
1621𓀴Now, I longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell; but
1622𓀴I was not going to put myself in jeopardy, and I told him my uncle and I
1623𓀴had an appointment with a lawyer.
1624𓀴
1625𓀴“Ay, ay,” said he, “he passed me word of that. But, ye see, the boat’ll
1626𓀴set ye ashore at the town pier, and that’s but a penny stonecast from
1627𓀴Rankeillor’s house.” And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in
1628𓀴my ear: “Take care of the old tod;[9] he means mischief. Come aboard till
1629𓀴I can get a word with ye.” And then, passing his arm through mine, he
1630𓀴continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: “But, come, what can I
1631𓀴bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour’s can command.
1632𓀴A roll of tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone
1633𓀴pipe? the mocking-bird that mews for all the world like a cat? the
1634𓀴cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your
1635𓀴pleasure.”
1636𓀴
1637𓀴     [9] Fox.
1638𓀴
1639𓀴By this time we were at the boat-side, and he was handing me in. I did
1640𓀴not dream of hanging back; I thought (the poor fool!) that I had found
1641𓀴a good friend and helper, and I was rejoiced to see the ship. As soon as
1642𓀴we were all set in our places, the boat was thrust off from the pier
1643𓀴and began to move over the waters: and what with my pleasure in this new
1644𓀴movement and my surprise at our low position, and the appearance of the
1645𓀴shores, and the growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it, I
1646𓀴could hardly understand what the captain said, and must have answered
1647𓀴him at random.
1648𓀴
1649𓀴As soon as we were alongside (where I sat fairly gaping at the ship’s
1650𓀴height, the strong humming of the tide against its sides, and the
1651𓀴pleasant cries of the seamen at their work) Hoseason, declaring that he
1652𓀴and I must be the first aboard, ordered a tackle to be sent down from
1653𓀴the main-yard. In this I was whipped into the air and set down again on
1654𓀴the deck, where the captain stood ready waiting for me, and instantly
1655𓀴slipped back his arm under mine. There I stood some while, a little
1656𓀴dizzy with the unsteadiness of all around me, perhaps a little afraid,
1657𓀴and yet vastly pleased with these strange sights; the captain meanwhile
1658𓀴pointing out the strangest, and telling me their names and uses.
1659𓀴
1660𓀴“But where is my uncle?” said I suddenly.
1661𓀴
1662𓀴“Ay,” said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness, “that’s the point.”
1663𓀴
1664𓀴I felt I was lost. With all my strength, I plucked myself clear of him
1665𓀴and ran to the bulwarks. Sure enough, there was the boat pulling for the
1666𓀴town, with my uncle sitting in the stern. I gave a piercing cry--“Help,
1667𓀴help! Murder!”--so that both sides of the anchorage rang with it, and
1668𓀴my uncle turned round where he was sitting, and showed me a face full of
1669𓀴cruelty and terror.
1670𓀴
1671𓀴It was the last I saw. Already strong hands had been plucking me back
1672𓀴from the ship’s side; and now a thunderbolt seemed to strike me; I saw a
1673𓀴great flash of fire, and fell senseless.
1674𓀴
1675𓀴
1676𓀴
1677𓀴
1678𓀴CHAPTER VII
1679𓀴
1680𓀴I GO TO SEA IN THE BRIG _COVENANT_ OF DYSART
1681𓀴
1682𓀴
1683𓀴I came to myself in darkness, in great pain, bound hand and foot, and
1684𓀴deafened by many unfamiliar noises. There sounded in my ears a roaring
1685𓀴of water as of a huge mill-dam, the thrashing of heavy sprays, the
1686𓀴thundering of the sails, and the shrill cries of seamen. The whole world
1687𓀴now heaved giddily up, and now rushed giddily downward; and so sick and
1688𓀴hurt was I in body, and my mind so much confounded, that it took me a
1689𓀴long while, chasing my thoughts up and down, and ever stunned again by
1690𓀴a fresh stab of pain, to realise that I must be lying somewhere bound in
1691𓀴the belly of that unlucky ship, and that the wind must have strengthened
1692𓀴to a gale. With the clear perception of my plight, there fell upon me a
1693𓀴blackness of despair, a horror of remorse at my own folly, and a passion
1694𓀴of anger at my uncle, that once more bereft me of my senses.
1695𓀴
1696𓀴When I returned again to life, the same uproar, the same confused and
1697𓀴violent movements, shook and deafened me; and presently, to my other
1698𓀴pains and distresses, there was added the sickness of an unused landsman
1699𓀴on the sea. In that time of my adventurous youth, I suffered many
1700𓀴hardships; but none that was so crushing to my mind and body, or lit by
1701𓀴so few hopes, as these first hours aboard the brig.
1702𓀴
1703𓀴I heard a gun fire, and supposed the storm had proved too strong for us,
1704𓀴and we were firing signals of distress. The thought of deliverance, even
1705𓀴by death in the deep sea, was welcome to me. Yet it was no such matter;
1706𓀴but (as I was afterwards told) a common habit of the captain’s, which
1707𓀴I here set down to show that even the worst man may have his kindlier
1708𓀴side. We were then passing, it appeared, within some miles of Dysart,
1709𓀴where the brig was built, and where old Mrs. Hoseason, the captain’s
1710𓀴mother, had come some years before to live; and whether outward or
1711𓀴inward bound, the _Covenant_ was never suffered to go by that place by
1712𓀴day, without a gun fired and colours shown.
1713𓀴
1714𓀴I had no measure of time; day and night were alike in that ill-smelling
1715𓀴cavern of the ship’s bowels where I lay; and the misery of my situation
1716𓀴drew out the hours to double. How long, therefore, I lay waiting to hear
1717𓀴the ship split upon some rock, or to feel her reel head foremost into
1718𓀴the depths of the sea, I have not the means of computation. But sleep at
1719𓀴length stole from me the consciousness of sorrow.
1720𓀴
1721𓀴I was awakened by the light of a hand-lantern shining in my face. A
1722𓀴small man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair,
1723𓀴stood looking down at me.
1724𓀴
1725𓀴“Well,” said he, “how goes it?”
1726𓀴
1727𓀴I answered by a sob; and my visitor then felt my pulse and temples, and
1728𓀴set himself to wash and dress the wound upon my scalp.
1729𓀴
1730𓀴“Ay,” said he, “a sore dunt.[10] What, man? Cheer up! The world’s no done;
1731𓀴you’ve made a bad start of it but you’ll make a better. Have you had any
1732𓀴meat?”
1733𓀴
1734𓀴     [10] Stroke.
1735𓀴
1736𓀴I said I could not look at it: and thereupon he gave me some brandy and
1737𓀴water in a tin pannikin, and left me once more to myself.
1738𓀴
1739𓀴The next time he came to see me, I was lying betwixt sleep and waking,
1740𓀴my eyes wide open in the darkness, the sickness quite departed, but
1741𓀴succeeded by a horrid giddiness and swimming that was almost worse
1742𓀴to bear. I ached, besides, in every limb, and the cords that bound me
1743𓀴seemed to be of fire. The smell of the hole in which I lay seemed to
1744𓀴have become a part of me; and during the long interval since his last
1745𓀴visit I had suffered tortures of fear, now from the scurrying of the
1746𓀴ship’s rats, that sometimes pattered on my very face, and now from the
1747𓀴dismal imaginings that haunt the bed of fever.
1748𓀴
1749𓀴The glimmer of the lantern, as a trap opened, shone in like the heaven’s
1750𓀴sunlight; and though it only showed me the strong, dark beams of the
1751𓀴ship that was my prison, I could have cried aloud for gladness. The man
1752𓀴with the green eyes was the first to descend the ladder, and I noticed
1753𓀴that he came somewhat unsteadily. He was followed by the captain.
1754𓀴Neither said a word; but the first set to and examined me, and dressed
1755𓀴my wound as before, while Hoseason looked me in my face with an odd,
1756𓀴black look.
1757𓀴
1758𓀴“Now, sir, you see for yourself,” said the first: “a high fever, no
1759𓀴appetite, no light, no meat: you see for yourself what that means.”
1760𓀴
1761𓀴“I am no conjurer, Mr. Riach,” said the captain.
1762𓀴
1763𓀴“Give me leave, sir,” said Riach; “you’ve a good head upon your
1764𓀴shoulders, and a good Scotch tongue to ask with; but I will leave you no
1765𓀴manner of excuse; I want that boy taken out of this hole and put in the
1766𓀴forecastle.”
1767𓀴
1768𓀴“What ye may want, sir, is a matter of concern to nobody but yoursel’,”
1769𓀴 returned the captain; “but I can tell ye that which is to be. Here he
1770𓀴is; here he shall bide.”
1771𓀴
1772𓀴“Admitting that you have been paid in a proportion,” said the other, “I
1773𓀴will crave leave humbly to say that I have not. Paid I am, and none too
1774𓀴much, to be the second officer of this old tub, and you ken very well if
1775𓀴I do my best to earn it. But I was paid for nothing more.”
1776𓀴
1777𓀴“If ye could hold back your hand from the tin-pan, Mr. Riach, I would
1778𓀴have no complaint to make of ye,” returned the skipper; “and instead
1779𓀴of asking riddles, I make bold to say that ye would keep your breath to
1780𓀴cool your porridge. We’ll be required on deck,” he added, in a sharper
1781𓀴note, and set one foot upon the ladder.
1782𓀴
1783𓀴But Mr. Riach caught him by the sleeve.
1784𓀴
1785𓀴“Admitting that you have been paid to do a murder----” he began.
1786𓀴
1787𓀴Hoseason turned upon him with a flash.
1788𓀴
1789𓀴“What’s that?” he cried. “What kind of talk is that?”
1790𓀴
1791𓀴“It seems it is the talk that you can understand,” said Mr. Riach,
1792𓀴looking him steadily in the face.
1793𓀴
1794𓀴“Mr. Riach, I have sailed with ye three cruises,” replied the captain.
1795𓀴“In all that time, sir, ye should have learned to know me: I’m a stiff
1796𓀴man, and a dour man; but for what ye say the now--fie, fie!--it comes
1797𓀴from a bad heart and a black conscience. If ye say the lad will die----”
1798𓀴
1799𓀴“Ay, will he!” said Mr. Riach.
1800𓀴
1801𓀴“Well, sir, is not that enough?” said Hoseason. “Flit him where ye
1802𓀴please!”
1803𓀴
1804𓀴Thereupon the captain ascended the ladder; and I, who had lain silent
1805𓀴throughout this strange conversation, beheld Mr. Riach turn after him
1806𓀴and bow as low as to his knees in what was plainly a spirit of derision.
1807𓀴Even in my then state of sickness, I perceived two things: that the
1808𓀴mate was touched with liquor, as the captain hinted, and that (drunk or
1809𓀴sober) he was like to prove a valuable friend.
1810𓀴
1811𓀴Five minutes afterwards my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man’s
1812𓀴back, carried up to the forecastle, and laid in a bunk on some
1813𓀴sea-blankets; where the first thing that I did was to lose my senses.
1814𓀴
1815𓀴It was a blessed thing indeed to open my eyes again upon the daylight,
1816𓀴and to find myself in the society of men. The forecastle was a roomy
1817𓀴place enough, set all about with berths, in which the men of the watch
1818𓀴below were seated smoking, or lying down asleep. The day being calm and
1819𓀴the wind fair, the scuttle was open, and not only the good daylight, but
1820𓀴from time to time (as the ship rolled) a dusty beam of sunlight shone
1821𓀴in, and dazzled and delighted me. I had no sooner moved, moreover, than
1822𓀴one of the men brought me a drink of something healing which Mr. Riach
1823𓀴had prepared, and bade me lie still and I should soon be well again.
1824𓀴There were no bones broken, he explained: “A clour[11] on the head was
1825𓀴naething. Man,” said he, “it was me that gave it ye!”
1826𓀴
1827𓀴     [11] Blow.
1828𓀴
1829𓀴Here I lay for the space of many days a close prisoner, and not only got
1830𓀴my health again, but came to know my companions. They were a rough lot
1831𓀴indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly
1832𓀴parts of life, and condemned to toss together on the rough seas, with
1833𓀴masters no less cruel. There were some among them that had sailed with
1834𓀴the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of; some
1835𓀴were men that had run from the king’s ships, and went with a halter
1836𓀴round their necks, of which they made no secret; and all, as the saying
1837𓀴goes, were “at a word and a blow” with their best friends. Yet I had
1838𓀴not been many days shut up with them before I began to be ashamed of my
1839𓀴first judgment, when I had drawn away from them at the Ferry pier, as
1840𓀴though they had been unclean beasts. No class of man is altogether bad,
1841𓀴but each has its own faults and virtues; and these shipmates of mine
1842𓀴were no exception to the rule. Rough they were, sure enough; and bad, I
1843𓀴suppose; but they had many virtues. They were kind when it occurred to
1844𓀴them, simple even beyond the simplicity of a country lad like me, and
1845𓀴had some glimmerings of honesty.
1846𓀴
1847𓀴There was one man, of maybe forty, that would sit on my berthside for
1848𓀴hours and tell me of his wife and child. He was a fisher that had lost
1849𓀴his boat, and thus been driven to the deep-sea voyaging. Well, it is
1850𓀴years ago now: but I have never forgotten him. His wife (who was “young
1851𓀴by him,” as he often told me) waited in vain to see her man return; he
1852𓀴would never again make the fire for her in the morning, nor yet keep
1853𓀴the bairn when she was sick. Indeed, many of these poor fellows (as the
1854𓀴event proved) were upon their last cruise; the deep seas and cannibal
1855𓀴fish received them; and it is a thankless business to speak ill of the
1856𓀴dead.
1857𓀴
1858𓀴Among other good deeds that they did, they returned my money, which had
1859𓀴been shared among them; and though it was about a third short, I was
1860𓀴very glad to get it, and hoped great good from it in the land I was
1861𓀴going to. The ship was bound for the Carolinas; and you must not suppose
1862𓀴that I was going to that place merely as an exile. The trade was even
1863𓀴then much depressed; since that, and with the rebellion of the colonies
1864𓀴and the formation of the United States, it has, of course, come to
1865𓀴an end; but in those days of my youth, white men were still sold into
1866𓀴slavery on the plantations, and that was the destiny to which my wicked
1867𓀴uncle had condemned me.
1868𓀴
1869𓀴The cabin-boy Ransome (from whom I had first heard of these atrocities)
1870𓀴came in at times from the round-house, where he berthed and served, now
1871𓀴nursing a bruised limb in silent agony, now raving against the cruelty
1872𓀴of Mr. Shuan. It made my heart bleed; but the men had a great respect
1873𓀴for the chief mate, who was, as they said, “the only seaman of the whole
1874𓀴jing-bang, and none such a bad man when he was sober.” Indeed, I found
1875𓀴there was a strange peculiarity about our two mates: that Mr. Riach was
1876𓀴sullen, unkind, and harsh when he was sober, and Mr. Shuan would not
1877𓀴hurt a fly except when he was drinking. I asked about the captain; but I
1878𓀴was told drink made no difference upon that man of iron.
1879𓀴
1880𓀴I did my best in the small time allowed me to make some thing like a
1881𓀴man, or rather I should say something like a boy, of the poor creature,
1882𓀴Ransome. But his mind was scarce truly human. He could remember nothing
1883𓀴of the time before he came to sea; only that his father had made clocks,
1884𓀴and had a starling in the parlour, which could whistle “The North
1885𓀴Countrie;” all else had been blotted out in these years of hardship
1886𓀴and cruelties. He had a strange notion of the dry land, picked up from
1887𓀴sailor’s stories: that it was a place where lads were put to some kind
1888𓀴of slavery called a trade, and where apprentices were continually lashed
1889𓀴and clapped into foul prisons. In a town, he thought every second person
1890𓀴a decoy, and every third house a place in which seamen would be drugged
1891𓀴and murdered. To be sure, I would tell him how kindly I had myself been
1892𓀴used upon that dry land he was so much afraid of, and how well fed and
1893𓀴carefully taught both by my friends and my parents: and if he had been
1894𓀴recently hurt, he would weep bitterly and swear to run away; but if
1895𓀴he was in his usual crackbrain humour, or (still more) if he had had a
1896𓀴glass of spirits in the roundhouse, he would deride the notion.
1897𓀴
1898𓀴It was Mr. Riach (Heaven forgive him!) who gave the boy drink; and
1899𓀴it was, doubtless, kindly meant; but besides that it was ruin to his
1900𓀴health, it was the pitifullest thing in life to see this unhappy,
1901𓀴unfriended creature staggering, and dancing, and talking he knew not
1902𓀴what. Some of the men laughed, but not all; others would grow as black
1903𓀴as thunder (thinking, perhaps, of their own childhood or their own
1904𓀴children) and bid him stop that nonsense, and think what he was doing.
1905𓀴As for me, I felt ashamed to look at him, and the poor child still comes
1906𓀴about me in my dreams.
1907𓀴
1908𓀴All this time, you should know, the _Covenant_ was meeting continual
1909𓀴head-winds and tumbling up and down against head-seas, so that the
1910𓀴scuttle was almost constantly shut, and the forecastle lighted only by a
1911𓀴swinging lantern on a beam. There was constant labour for all hands; the
1912𓀴sails had to be made and shortened every hour; the strain told on the
1913𓀴men’s temper; there was a growl of quarrelling all day long from berth
1914𓀴to berth; and as I was never allowed to set my foot on deck, you
1915𓀴can picture to yourselves how weary of my life I grew to be, and how
1916𓀴impatient for a change.
1917𓀴
1918𓀴And a change I was to get, as you shall hear; but I must first tell of
1919𓀴a conversation I had with Mr. Riach, which put a little heart in me to
1920𓀴bear my troubles. Getting him in a favourable stage of drink (for indeed
1921𓀴he never looked near me when he was sober), I pledged him to secrecy,
1922𓀴and told him my whole story.
1923𓀴
1924𓀴He declared it was like a ballad; that he would do his best to help
1925𓀴me; that I should have paper, pen, and ink, and write one line to Mr.
1926𓀴Campbell and another to Mr. Rankeillor; and that if I had told the
1927𓀴truth, ten to one he would be able (with their help) to pull me through
1928𓀴and set me in my rights.
1929𓀴
1930𓀴“And in the meantime,” says he, “keep your heart up. You’re not the only
1931𓀴one, I’ll tell you that. There’s many a man hoeing tobacco over-seas
1932𓀴that should be mounting his horse at his own door at home; many and
1933𓀴many! And life is all a variorum, at the best. Look at me: I’m a laird’s
1934𓀴son and more than half a doctor, and here I am, man-Jack to Hoseason!”
1935𓀴
1936𓀴I thought it would be civil to ask him for his story.
1937𓀴
1938𓀴He whistled loud.
1939𓀴
1940𓀴“Never had one,” said he. “I like fun, that’s all.” And he skipped out
1941𓀴of the forecastle.
1942𓀴
1943𓀴
1944𓀴
1945𓀴
1946𓀴CHAPTER VIII
1947𓀴
1948𓀴THE ROUND-HOUSE
1949𓀴
1950𓀴
1951𓀴One night, about eleven o’clock, a man of Mr. Riach’s watch (which was
1952𓀴on deck) came below for his jacket; and instantly there began to go
1953𓀴a whisper about the forecastle that “Shuan had done for him at last.”
1954𓀴 There was no need of a name; we all knew who was meant; but we had
1955𓀴scarce time to get the idea rightly in our heads, far less to speak of
1956𓀴it, when the scuttle was again flung open, and Captain Hoseason came
1957𓀴down the ladder. He looked sharply round the bunks in the tossing light
1958𓀴of the lantern; and then, walking straight up to me, he addressed me, to
1959𓀴my surprise, in tones of kindness.
1960𓀴
1961𓀴“My man,” said he, “we want ye to serve in the round-house. You and
1962𓀴Ransome are to change berths. Run away aft with ye.”
1963𓀴
1964𓀴Even as he spoke, two seamen appeared in the scuttle, carrying Ransome
1965𓀴in their arms; and the ship at that moment giving a great sheer into the
1966𓀴sea, and the lantern swinging, the light fell direct on the boy’s face.
1967𓀴It was as white as wax, and had a look upon it like a dreadful smile.
1968𓀴The blood in me ran cold, and I drew in my breath as if I had been
1969𓀴struck.
1970𓀴
1971𓀴“Run away aft; run away aft with ye!” cried Hoseason.
1972𓀴
1973𓀴And at that I brushed by the sailors and the boy (who neither spoke nor
1974𓀴moved), and ran up the ladder on deck.
1975𓀴
1976𓀴The brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long, cresting
1977𓀴swell. She was on the starboard tack, and on the left hand, under the
1978𓀴arched foot of the foresail, I could see the sunset still quite bright.
1979𓀴This, at such an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too
1980𓀴ignorant to draw the true conclusion--that we were going north-about
1981𓀴round Scotland, and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and
1982𓀴Shetland Islands, having avoided the dangerous currents of the Pentland
1983𓀴Firth. For my part, who had been so long shut in the dark and knew
1984𓀴nothing of head-winds, I thought we might be half-way or more across the
1985𓀴Atlantic. And indeed (beyond that I wondered a little at the lateness of
1986𓀴the sunset light) I gave no heed to it, and pushed on across the decks,
1987𓀴running between the seas, catching at ropes, and only saved from going
1988𓀴overboard by one of the hands on deck, who had been always kind to me.
1989𓀴
1990𓀴The round-house, for which I was bound, and where I was now to sleep and
1991𓀴serve, stood some six feet above the decks, and considering the size of
1992𓀴the brig, was of good dimensions. Inside were a fixed table and bench,
1993𓀴and two berths, one for the captain and the other for the two mates,
1994𓀴turn and turn about. It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom,
1995𓀴so as to stow away the officers’ belongings and a part of the ship’s
1996𓀴stores; there was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a
1997𓀴hatchway in the middle of the deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and
1998𓀴drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all
1999𓀴the firearms, except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a
2000𓀴rack in the aftermost wall of the round-house. The most of the cutlasses
2001𓀴were in another place.
2002𓀴
2003𓀴A small window with a shutter on each side, and a skylight in the roof,
2004𓀴gave it light by day; and after dark there was a lamp always burning.
2005𓀴It was burning when I entered, not brightly, but enough to show Mr.
2006𓀴Shuan sitting at the table, with the brandy bottle and a tin pannikin
2007𓀴in front of him. He was a tall man, strongly made and very black; and he
2008𓀴stared before him on the table like one stupid.
2009𓀴
2010𓀴He took no notice of my coming in; nor did he move when the captain
2011𓀴followed and leant on the berth beside me, looking darkly at the mate.
2012𓀴I stood in great fear of Hoseason, and had my reasons for it; but
2013𓀴something told me I need not be afraid of him just then; and I whispered
2014𓀴in his ear: “How is he?” He shook his head like one that does not know
2015𓀴and does not wish to think, and his face was very stern.
2016𓀴
2017𓀴Presently Mr. Riach came in. He gave the captain a glance that meant the
2018𓀴boy was dead as plain as speaking, and took his place like the rest
2019𓀴of us; so that we all three stood without a word, staring down at Mr.
2020𓀴Shuan, and Mr. Shuan (on his side) sat without a word, looking hard upon
2021𓀴the table.
2022𓀴
2023𓀴All of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle; and at that Mr.
2024𓀴Riach started forward and caught it away from him, rather by surprise
2025𓀴than violence, crying out, with an oath, that there had been too much of
2026𓀴this work altogether, and that a judgment would fall upon the ship.
2027𓀴And as he spoke (the weather sliding-doors standing open) he tossed the
2028𓀴bottle into the sea.
2029𓀴
2030𓀴Mr. Shuan was on his feet in a trice; he still looked dazed, but he
2031𓀴meant murder, ay, and would have done it, for the second time that
2032𓀴night, had not the captain stepped in between him and his victim.
2033𓀴
2034𓀴“Sit down!” roars the captain. “Ye sot and swine, do ye know what ye’ve
2035𓀴done? Ye’ve murdered the boy!”
2036𓀴
2037𓀴Mr. Shuan seemed to understand; for he sat down again, and put up his
2038𓀴hand to his brow.
2039𓀴
2040𓀴“Well,” he said, “he brought me a dirty pannikin!”
2041𓀴
2042𓀴At that word, the captain and I and Mr. Riach all looked at each other
2043𓀴for a second with a kind of frightened look; and then Hoseason walked
2044𓀴up to his chief officer, took him by the shoulder, led him across to his
2045𓀴bunk, and bade him lie down and go to sleep, as you might speak to a bad
2046𓀴child. The murderer cried a little, but he took off his sea-boots and
2047𓀴obeyed.
2048𓀴
2049𓀴“Ah!” cried Mr. Riach, with a dreadful voice, “ye should have interfered
2050𓀴long syne. It’s too late now.”
2051𓀴
2052𓀴“Mr. Riach,” said the captain, “this night’s work must never be kennt
2053𓀴in Dysart. The boy went overboard, sir; that’s what the story is; and I
2054𓀴would give five pounds out of my pocket it was true!” He turned to the
2055𓀴table. “What made ye throw the good bottle away?” he added. “There was
2056𓀴nae sense in that, sir. Here, David, draw me another. They’re in the
2057𓀴bottom locker;” and he tossed me a key. “Ye’ll need a glass yourself,
2058𓀴sir,” he added to Riach. “Yon was an ugly thing to see.”
2059𓀴
2060𓀴So the pair sat down and hob-a-nobbed; and while they did so, the
2061𓀴murderer, who had been lying and whimpering in his berth, raised himself
2062𓀴upon his elbow and looked at them and at me.
2063𓀴
2064𓀴That was the first night of my new duties; and in the course of the next
2065𓀴day I had got well into the run of them. I had to serve at the meals,
2066𓀴which the captain took at regular hours, sitting down with the officer
2067𓀴who was off duty; all the day through I would be running with a dram
2068𓀴to one or other of my three masters; and at night I slept on a blanket
2069𓀴thrown on the deck boards at the aftermost end of the round-house, and
2070𓀴right in the draught of the two doors. It was a hard and a cold bed;
2071𓀴nor was I suffered to sleep without interruption; for some one would be
2072𓀴always coming in from deck to get a dram, and when a fresh watch was
2073𓀴to be set, two and sometimes all three would sit down and brew a bowl
2074𓀴together. How they kept their health, I know not, any more than how I
2075𓀴kept my own.
2076𓀴
2077𓀴And yet in other ways it was an easy service. There was no cloth to lay;
2078𓀴the meals were either of oatmeal porridge or salt junk, except twice a
2079𓀴week, when there was duff: and though I was clumsy enough and (not being
2080𓀴firm on my sealegs) sometimes fell with what I was bringing them, both
2081𓀴Mr. Riach and the captain were singularly patient. I could not but fancy
2082𓀴they were making up lee-way with their consciences, and that they
2083𓀴would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with
2084𓀴Ransome.
2085𓀴
2086𓀴As for Mr. Shuan, the drink or his crime, or the two together, had
2087𓀴certainly troubled his mind. I cannot say I ever saw him in his proper
2088𓀴wits. He never grew used to my being there, stared at me continually
2089𓀴(sometimes, I could have thought, with terror), and more than once drew
2090𓀴back from my hand when I was serving him. I was pretty sure from the
2091𓀴first that he had no clear mind of what he had done, and on my second
2092𓀴day in the round-house I had the proof of it. We were alone, and he had
2093𓀴been staring at me a long time, when all at once, up he got, as pale as
2094𓀴death, and came close up to me, to my great terror. But I had no cause
2095𓀴to be afraid of him.
2096𓀴
2097𓀴“You were not here before?” he asked.
2098𓀴
2099𓀴“No, sir,” said I.”
2100𓀴
2101𓀴“There was another boy?” he asked again; and when I had answered him,
2102𓀴“Ah!” says he, “I thought that,” and went and sat down, without another
2103𓀴word, except to call for brandy.
2104𓀴
2105𓀴You may think it strange, but for all the horror I had, I was still
2106𓀴sorry for him. He was a married man, with a wife in Leith; but whether
2107𓀴or no he had a family, I have now forgotten; I hope not.
2108𓀴
2109𓀴Altogether it was no very hard life for the time it lasted, which (as
2110𓀴you are to hear) was not long. I was as well fed as the best of them;
2111𓀴even their pickles, which were the great dainty, I was allowed my share
2112𓀴of; and had I liked I might have been drunk from morning to night, like
2113𓀴Mr. Shuan. I had company, too, and good company of its sort. Mr. Riach,
2114𓀴who had been to the college, spoke to me like a friend when he was not
2115𓀴sulking, and told me many curious things, and some that were informing;
2116𓀴and even the captain, though he kept me at the stick’s end the most part
2117𓀴of the time, would sometimes unbuckle a bit, and tell me of the fine
2118𓀴countries he had visited.
2119𓀴
2120𓀴The shadow of poor Ransome, to be sure, lay on all four of us, and on
2121𓀴me and Mr. Shuan in particular, most heavily. And then I had another
2122𓀴trouble of my own. Here I was, doing dirty work for three men that I
2123𓀴looked down upon, and one of whom, at least, should have hung upon a
2124𓀴gallows; that was for the present; and as for the future, I could only
2125𓀴see myself slaving alongside of negroes in the tobacco fields. Mr.
2126𓀴Riach, perhaps from caution, would never suffer me to say another word
2127𓀴about my story; the captain, whom I tried to approach, rebuffed me like
2128𓀴a dog and would not hear a word; and as the days came and went, my heart
2129𓀴sank lower and lower, till I was even glad of the work which kept me
2130𓀴from thinking.

2135𓀴CHAPTER IX
2136𓀴
2137𓀴THE MAN WITH THE BELT OF GOLD
2138𓀴
2139𓀴
2140𓀴More than a week went by, in which the ill-luck that had hitherto
2141𓀴pursued the _Covenant_ upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked.
2142𓀴Some days she made a little way; others, she was driven actually back.
2143𓀴At last we were beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to
2144𓀴and fro the whole of the ninth day, within sight of Cape Wrath and the
2145𓀴wild, rocky coast on either hand of it. There followed on that a council
2146𓀴of the officers, and some decision which I did not rightly understand,
2147𓀴seeing only the result: that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and
2148𓀴were running south.
2149𓀴
2150𓀴The tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick, wet, white
2151𓀴fog that hid one end of the brig from the other. All afternoon, when
2152𓀴I went on deck, I saw men and officers listening hard over the
2153𓀴bulwarks--“for breakers,” they said; and though I did not so much as
2154𓀴understand the word, I felt danger in the air, and was excited.
2155𓀴
2156𓀴Maybe about ten at night, I was serving Mr. Riach and the captain at
2157𓀴their supper, when the ship struck something with a great sound, and we
2158𓀴heard voices singing out. My two masters leaped to their feet.
2159𓀴
2160𓀴“She’s struck!” said Mr. Riach.
2161𓀴
2162𓀴“No, sir,” said the captain. “We’ve only run a boat down.”
2163𓀴
2164𓀴And they hurried out.
2165𓀴
2166𓀴The captain was in the right of it. We had run down a boat in the fog,
2167𓀴and she had parted in the midst and gone to the bottom with all her crew
2168𓀴but one. This man (as I heard afterwards) had been sitting in the stern
2169𓀴as a passenger, while the rest were on the benches rowing. At the moment
2170𓀴of the blow, the stern had been thrown into the air, and the man (having
2171𓀴his hands free, and for all he was encumbered with a frieze overcoat
2172𓀴that came below his knees) had leaped up and caught hold of the brig’s
2173𓀴bowsprit. It showed he had luck and much agility and unusual strength,
2174𓀴that he should have thus saved himself from such a pass. And yet, when
2175𓀴the captain brought him into the round-house, and I set eyes on him for
2176𓀴the first time, he looked as cool as I did.
2177𓀴
2178𓀴He was smallish in stature, but well set and as nimble as a goat; his
2179𓀴face was of a good open expression, but sunburnt very dark, and heavily
2180𓀴freckled and pitted with the small-pox; his eyes were unusually light
2181𓀴and had a kind of dancing madness in them, that was both engaging and
2182𓀴alarming; and when he took off his great-coat, he laid a pair of fine
2183𓀴silver-mounted pistols on the table, and I saw that he was belted with
2184𓀴a great sword. His manners, besides, were elegant, and he pledged the
2185𓀴captain handsomely. Altogether I thought of him, at the first sight,
2186𓀴that here was a man I would rather call my friend than my enemy.
2187𓀴
2188𓀴The captain, too, was taking his observations, but rather of the man’s
2189𓀴clothes than his person. And to be sure, as soon as he had taken off
2190𓀴the great-coat, he showed forth mighty fine for the round-house of a
2191𓀴merchant brig: having a hat with feathers, a red waistcoat, breeches
2192𓀴of black plush, and a blue coat with silver buttons and handsome silver
2193𓀴lace; costly clothes, though somewhat spoiled with the fog and being
2194𓀴slept in.
2195𓀴
2196𓀴“I’m vexed, sir, about the boat,” says the captain.
2197𓀴
2198𓀴“There are some pretty men gone to the bottom,” said the stranger, “that
2199𓀴I would rather see on the dry land again than half a score of boats.”
2200𓀴
2201𓀴“Friends of yours?” said Hoseason.
2202𓀴
2203𓀴“You have none such friends in your country,” was the reply. “They would
2204𓀴have died for me like dogs.”
2205𓀴
2206𓀴“Well, sir,” said the captain, still watching him, “there are more men
2207𓀴in the world than boats to put them in.”
2208𓀴
2209𓀴“And that’s true, too,” cried the other, “and ye seem to be a gentleman
2210𓀴of great penetration.”
2211𓀴
2212𓀴“I have been in France, sir,” says the captain, so that it was plain he
2213𓀴meant more by the words than showed upon the face of them.
2214𓀴
2215𓀴“Well, sir,” says the other, “and so has many a pretty man, for the
2216𓀴matter of that.”
2217𓀴
2218𓀴“No doubt, sir,” says the captain, “and fine coats.”
2219𓀴
2220𓀴“Oho!” says the stranger, “is that how the wind sets?” And he laid his
2221𓀴hand quickly on his pistols.
2222𓀴
2223𓀴“Don’t be hasty,” said the captain. “Don’t do a mischief before ye
2224𓀴see the need of it. Ye’ve a French soldier’s coat upon your back and a
2225𓀴Scotch tongue in your head, to be sure; but so has many an honest fellow
2226𓀴in these days, and I dare say none the worse of it.”
2227𓀴
2228𓀴“So?” said the gentleman in the fine coat: “are ye of the honest party?”
2229𓀴 (meaning, Was he a Jacobite? for each side, in these sort of civil
2230𓀴broils, takes the name of honesty for its own).
2231𓀴
2232𓀴“Why, sir,” replied the captain, “I am a true-blue Protestant, and I
2233𓀴thank God for it.” (It was the first word of any religion I had ever
2234𓀴heard from him, but I learnt afterwards he was a great church-goer while
2235𓀴on shore.) “But, for all that,” says he, “I can be sorry to see another
2236𓀴man with his back to the wall.”
2237𓀴
2238𓀴“Can ye so, indeed?” asked the Jacobite. “Well, sir, to be quite plain
2239𓀴with ye, I am one of those honest gentlemen that were in trouble about
2240𓀴the years forty-five and six; and (to be still quite plain with ye) if
2241𓀴I got into the hands of any of the red-coated gentry, it’s like it would
2242𓀴go hard with me. Now, sir, I was for France; and there was a French ship
2243𓀴cruising here to pick me up; but she gave us the go-by in the fog--as I
2244𓀴wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel’! And the best that I can
2245𓀴say is this: If ye can set me ashore where I was going, I have that upon
2246𓀴me will reward you highly for your trouble.”
2247𓀴
2248𓀴“In France?” says the captain. “No, sir; that I cannot do. But where ye
2249𓀴come from--we might talk of that.”
2250𓀴
2251𓀴And then, unhappily, he observed me standing in my corner, and packed
2252𓀴me off to the galley to get supper for the gentleman. I lost no time,
2253𓀴I promise you; and when I came back into the round-house, I found the
2254𓀴gentleman had taken a money-belt from about his waist, and poured out
2255𓀴a guinea or two upon the table. The captain was looking at the guineas,
2256𓀴and then at the belt, and then at the gentleman’s face; and I thought he
2257𓀴seemed excited.
2258𓀴
2259𓀴“Half of it,” he cried, “and I’m your man!”
2260𓀴
2261𓀴The other swept back the guineas into the belt, and put it on again
2262𓀴under his waistcoat. “I have told ye sir,” said he, “that not one doit
2263𓀴of it belongs to me. It belongs to my chieftain,” and here he touched
2264𓀴his hat, “and while I would be but a silly messenger to grudge some of
2265𓀴it that the rest might come safe, I should show myself a hound indeed if
2266𓀴I bought my own carcase any too dear. Thirty guineas on the sea-side, or
2267𓀴sixty if ye set me on the Linnhe Loch. Take it, if ye will; if not, ye
2268𓀴can do your worst.”
2269𓀴
2270𓀴“Ay,” said Hoseason. “And if I give ye over to the soldiers?”
2271𓀴
2272𓀴“Ye would make a fool’s bargain,” said the other. “My chief, let me tell
2273𓀴you, sir, is forfeited, like every honest man in Scotland. His estate
2274𓀴is in the hands of the man they call King George; and it is his officers
2275𓀴that collect the rents, or try to collect them. But for the honour of
2276𓀴Scotland, the poor tenant bodies take a thought upon their chief lying
2277𓀴in exile; and this money is a part of that very rent for which King
2278𓀴George is looking. Now, sir, ye seem to me to be a man that understands
2279𓀴things: bring this money within the reach of Government, and how much of
2280𓀴it’ll come to you?”
2281𓀴
2282𓀴“Little enough, to be sure,” said Hoseason; and then, “if they knew,” he
2283𓀴added, drily. “But I think, if I was to try, that I could hold my tongue
2284𓀴about it.”
2285𓀴
2286𓀴“Ah, but I’ll begowk[12] ye there!” cried the gentleman. “Play me false,
2287𓀴and I’ll play you cunning. If a hand is laid upon me, they shall ken
2288𓀴what money it is.”
2289𓀴
2290𓀴     [12] Befool.
2291𓀴
2292𓀴“Well,” returned the captain, “what must be must. Sixty guineas, and
2293𓀴done. Here’s my hand upon it.”
2294𓀴
2295𓀴“And here’s mine,” said the other.
2296𓀴
2297𓀴And thereupon the captain went out (rather hurriedly, I thought), and
2298𓀴left me alone in the round-house with the stranger.
2299𓀴
2300𓀴At that period (so soon after the forty-five) there were many exiled
2301𓀴gentlemen coming back at the peril of their lives, either to see their
2302𓀴friends or to collect a little money; and as for the Highland chiefs
2303𓀴that had been forfeited, it was a common matter of talk how their
2304𓀴tenants would stint themselves to send them money, and their clansmen
2305𓀴outface the soldiery to get it in, and run the gauntlet of our great
2306𓀴navy to carry it across. All this I had, of course, heard tell of; and
2307𓀴now I had a man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts
2308𓀴and upon one more, for he was not only a rebel and a smuggler of rents,
2309𓀴but had taken service with King Louis of France. And as if all this
2310𓀴were not enough, he had a belt full of golden guineas round his loins.
2311𓀴Whatever my opinions, I could not look on such a man without a lively
2312𓀴interest.
2313𓀴
2314𓀴“And so you’re a Jacobite?” said I, as I set meat before him.
2315𓀴
2316𓀴“Ay,” said he, beginning to eat. “And you, by your long face, should be
2317𓀴a Whig?”[13]
2318𓀴
2319𓀴     [13] Whig or Whigamore was the cant name for those who were
2320𓀴     loyal to King George.
2321𓀴
2322𓀴“Betwixt and between,” said I, not to annoy him; for indeed I was as
2323𓀴good a Whig as Mr. Campbell could make me.
2324𓀴
2325𓀴“And that’s naething,” said he. “But I’m saying, Mr.
2326𓀴Betwixt-and-Between,” he added, “this bottle of yours is dry; and it’s
2327𓀴hard if I’m to pay sixty guineas and be grudged a dram upon the back of
2328𓀴it.”
2329𓀴
2330𓀴“I’ll go and ask for the key,” said I, and stepped on deck.
2331𓀴
2332𓀴The fog was as close as ever, but the swell almost down. They had laid
2333𓀴the brig to, not knowing precisely where they were, and the wind (what
2334𓀴little there was of it) not serving well for their true course. Some of
2335𓀴the hands were still hearkening for breakers; but the captain and the
2336𓀴two officers were in the waist with their heads together. It struck me
2337𓀴(I don’t know why) that they were after no good; and the first word I
2338𓀴heard, as I drew softly near, more than confirmed me.
2339𓀴
2340𓀴It was Mr. Riach, crying out as if upon a sudden thought: “Couldn’t we
2341𓀴wile him out of the round-house?”
2342𓀴
2343𓀴“He’s better where he is,” returned Hoseason; “he hasn’t room to use his
2344𓀴sword.”
2345𓀴
2346𓀴“Well, that’s true,” said Riach; “but he’s hard to come at.”
2347𓀴
2348𓀴“Hut!” said Hoseason. “We can get the man in talk, one upon each side,
2349𓀴and pin him by the two arms; or if that’ll not hold, sir, we can make a
2350𓀴run by both the doors and get him under hand before he has the time to
2351𓀴draw.”
2352𓀴
2353𓀴At this hearing, I was seized with both fear and anger at these
2354𓀴treacherous, greedy, bloody men that I sailed with. My first mind was to
2355𓀴run away; my second was bolder.
2356𓀴
2357𓀴“Captain,” said I, “the gentleman is seeking a dram, and the bottle’s
2358𓀴out. Will you give me the key?”
2359𓀴
2360𓀴They all started and turned about.
2361𓀴
2362𓀴“Why, here’s our chance to get the firearms!”
2363𓀴
2364𓀴Riach cried; and then to me: “Hark ye, David,” he said, “do ye ken where
2365𓀴the pistols are?”
2366𓀴
2367𓀴“Ay, ay,” put in Hoseason. “David kens; David’s a good lad. Ye see,
2368𓀴David my man, yon wild Hielandman is a danger to the ship, besides being
2369𓀴a rank foe to King George, God bless him!”
2370𓀴
2371𓀴I had never been so be-Davided since I came on board: but I said Yes, as
2372𓀴if all I heard were quite natural.
2373𓀴
2374𓀴“The trouble is,” resumed the captain, “that all our firelocks, great
2375𓀴and little, are in the round-house under this man’s nose; likewise the
2376𓀴powder. Now, if I, or one of the officers, was to go in and take them,
2377𓀴he would fall to thinking. But a lad like you, David, might snap up a
2378𓀴horn and a pistol or two without remark. And if ye can do it cleverly,
2379𓀴I’ll bear it in mind when it’ll be good for you to have friends; and
2380𓀴that’s when we come to Carolina.”
2381𓀴
2382𓀴Here Mr. Riach whispered him a little.
2383𓀴
2384𓀴“Very right, sir,” said the captain; and then to myself: “And see here,
2385𓀴David, yon man has a beltful of gold, and I give you my word that you
2386𓀴shall have your fingers in it.”
2387𓀴
2388𓀴I told him I would do as he wished, though indeed I had scarce breath to
2389𓀴speak with; and upon that he gave me the key of the spirit locker, and I
2390𓀴began to go slowly back to the round-house. What was I to do? They
2391𓀴were dogs and thieves; they had stolen me from my own country; they had
2392𓀴killed poor Ransome; and was I to hold the candle to another murder? But
2393𓀴then, upon the other hand, there was the fear of death very plain before
2394𓀴me; for what could a boy and a man, if they were as brave as lions,
2395𓀴against a whole ship’s company?
2396𓀴
2397𓀴I was still arguing it back and forth, and getting no great clearness,
2398𓀴when I came into the round-house and saw the Jacobite eating his supper
2399𓀴under the lamp; and at that my mind was made up all in a moment. I have
2400𓀴no credit by it; it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion,
2401𓀴that I walked right up to the table and put my hand on his shoulder.
2402𓀴
2403𓀴“Do ye want to be killed?” said I. He sprang to his feet, and looked a
2404𓀴question at me as clear as if he had spoken.
2405𓀴
2406𓀴“O!” cried I, “they’re all murderers here; it’s a ship full of them!
2407𓀴They’ve murdered a boy already. Now it’s you.”
2408𓀴
2409𓀴“Ay, ay,” said he; “but they have n’t got me yet.” And then looking at me
2410𓀴curiously, “Will ye stand with me?”
2411𓀴
2412𓀴“That will I!” said I. “I am no thief, nor yet murderer. I’ll stand by
2413𓀴you.”
2414𓀴
2415𓀴“Why, then,” said he, “what’s your name?”
2416𓀴
2417𓀴“David Balfour,” said I; and then, thinking that a man with so fine a
2418𓀴coat must like fine people, I added for the first time, “of Shaws.”
2419𓀴
2420𓀴It never occurred to him to doubt me, for a Highlander is used to see
2421𓀴great gentlefolk in great poverty; but as he had no estate of his own,
2422𓀴my words nettled a very childish vanity he had.
2423𓀴
2424𓀴“My name is Stewart,” he said, drawing himself up. “Alan Breck, they
2425𓀴call me. A king’s name is good enough for me, though I bear it plain and
2426𓀴have the name of no farm-midden to clap to the hind-end of it.”
2427𓀴
2428𓀴And having administered this rebuke, as though it were something of a
2429𓀴chief importance, he turned to examine our defences.
2430𓀴
2431𓀴The round-house was built very strong, to support the breaching of the
2432𓀴seas. Of its five apertures, only the skylight and the two doors were
2433𓀴large enough for the passage of a man. The doors, besides, could be
2434𓀴drawn close: they were of stout oak, and ran in grooves, and were fitted
2435𓀴with hooks to keep them either shut or open, as the need arose. The
2436𓀴one that was already shut I secured in this fashion; but when I was
2437𓀴proceeding to slide to the other, Alan stopped me.
2438𓀴
2439𓀴“David,” said he--“for I cannae bring to mind the name of your landed
2440𓀴estate, and so will make so bold as to call you David--that door, being
2441𓀴open, is the best part of my defences.”
2442𓀴
2443𓀴“It would be yet better shut,” says I.
2444𓀴
2445𓀴“Not so, David,” says he. “Ye see, I have but one face; but so long as
2446𓀴that door is open and my face to it, the best part of my enemies will be
2447𓀴in front of me, where I would aye wish to find them.”
2448𓀴
2449𓀴Then he gave me from the rack a cutlass (of which there were a few
2450𓀴besides the firearms), choosing it with great care, shaking his head and
2451𓀴saying he had never in all his life seen poorer weapons; and next he set
2452𓀴me down to the table with a powder-horn, a bag of bullets and all the
2453𓀴pistols, which he bade me charge.
2454𓀴
2455𓀴“And that will be better work, let me tell you,” said he, “for a
2456𓀴gentleman of decent birth, than scraping plates and raxing[14] drams to a
2457𓀴wheen tarry sailors.”
2458𓀴
2459𓀴     [14] Reaching.
2460𓀴
2461𓀴Thereupon he stood up in the midst with his face to the door, and
2462𓀴drawing his great sword, made trial of the room he had to wield it in.
2463𓀴
2464𓀴“I must stick to the point,” he said, shaking his head; “and that’s a
2465𓀴pity, too. It doesn’t set my genius, which is all for the upper guard.
2466𓀴And, now,” said he, “do you keep on charging the pistols, and give heed
2467𓀴to me.”
2468𓀴
2469𓀴I told him I would listen closely. My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the
2470𓀴light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to
2471𓀴leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard
2472𓀴washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast
2473𓀴ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.
2474𓀴
2475𓀴“First of all,” said he, “how many are against us?”
2476𓀴
2477𓀴I reckoned them up; and such was the hurry of my mind, I had to cast the
2478𓀴numbers twice. “Fifteen,” said I.
2479𓀴
2480𓀴Alan whistled. “Well,” said he, “that can’t be cured. And now follow me.
2481𓀴It is my part to keep this door, where I look for the main battle. In
2482𓀴that, ye have no hand. And mind and dinnae fire to this side unless they
2483𓀴get me down; for I would rather have ten foes in front of me than one
2484𓀴friend like you cracking pistols at my back.”
2485𓀴
2486𓀴I told him, indeed I was no great shot.
2487𓀴
2488𓀴“And that’s very bravely said,” he cried, in a great admiration of my
2489𓀴candour. “There’s many a pretty gentleman that wouldnae dare to say it.”
2490𓀴
2491𓀴“But then, sir,” said I, “there is the door behind you, which they may
2492𓀴perhaps break in.”
2493𓀴
2494𓀴“Ay,” said he, “and that is a part of your work. No sooner the pistols
2495𓀴charged, than ye must climb up into yon bed where ye’re handy at the
2496𓀴window; and if they lift hand against the door, ye’re to shoot. But
2497𓀴that’s not all. Let’s make a bit of a soldier of ye, David. What else
2498𓀴have ye to guard?”
2499𓀴
2500𓀴“There’s the skylight,” said I. “But indeed, Mr. Stewart, I would need
2501𓀴to have eyes upon both sides to keep the two of them; for when my face
2502𓀴is at the one, my back is to the other.”
2503𓀴
2504𓀴“And that’s very true,” said Alan. “But have ye no ears to your head?”
2505𓀴
2506𓀴“To be sure!” cried I. “I must hear the bursting of the glass!”
2507𓀴
2508𓀴“Ye have some rudiments of sense,” said Alan, grimly.

2513𓀴CHAPTER X
2514𓀴
2515𓀴THE SIEGE OF THE ROUND-HOUSE
2516𓀴
2517𓀴
2518𓀴But now our time of truce was come to an end. Those on deck had waited
2519𓀴for my coming till they grew impatient; and scarce had Alan spoken, when
2520𓀴the captain showed face in the open door.
2521𓀴
2522𓀴“Stand!” cried Alan, and pointed his sword at him. The captain stood,
2523𓀴indeed; but he neither winced nor drew back a foot.
2524𓀴
2525𓀴“A naked sword?” says he. “This is a strange return for hospitality.”
2526𓀴
2527𓀴“Do ye see me?” said Alan. “I am come of kings; I bear a king’s name. My
2528𓀴badge is the oak. Do ye see my sword? It has slashed the heads off mair
2529𓀴Whigamores than you have toes upon your feet. Call up your vermin to
2530𓀴your back, sir, and fall on! The sooner the clash begins, the sooner
2531𓀴ye’ll taste this steel throughout your vitals.”
2532𓀴
2533𓀴The captain said nothing to Alan, but he looked over at me with an ugly
2534𓀴look. “David,” said he, “I’ll mind this;” and the sound of his voice
2535𓀴went through me with a jar.
2536𓀴
2537𓀴Next moment he was gone.
2538𓀴
2539𓀴“And now,” said Alan, “let your hand keep your head, for the grip is
2540𓀴coming.”
2541𓀴
2542𓀴Alan drew a dirk, which he held in his left hand in case they should run
2543𓀴in under his sword. I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with
2544𓀴an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the
2545𓀴window where I was to watch. It was a small part of the deck that I
2546𓀴could overlook, but enough for our purpose. The sea had gone down, and
2547𓀴the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet; so that there was a
2548𓀴great stillness in the ship, in which I made sure I heard the sound of
2549𓀴muttering voices. A little after, and there came a clash of steel upon
2550𓀴the deck, by which I knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one
2551𓀴had been let fall; and after that, silence again.
2552𓀴
2553𓀴I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a
2554𓀴bird’s, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my
2555𓀴eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned. As
2556𓀴for hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger
2557𓀴against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as I was
2558𓀴able. I tried to pray, I remember, but that same hurry of my mind, like
2559𓀴a man running, would not suffer me to think upon the words; and my chief
2560𓀴wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it.
2561𓀴
2562𓀴It came all of a sudden when it did, with a rush of feet and a roar, and
2563𓀴then a shout from Alan, and a sound of blows and some one crying out
2564𓀴as if hurt. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw Mr. Shuan in the
2565𓀴doorway, crossing blades with Alan.
2566𓀴
2567𓀴“That’s him that killed the boy!” I cried.
2568𓀴
2569𓀴“Look to your window!” said Alan; and as I turned back to my place, I
2570𓀴saw him pass his sword through the mate’s body.
2571𓀴
2572𓀴It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was
2573𓀴scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for
2574𓀴a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had
2575𓀴never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less
2576𓀴against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they
2577𓀴swang the yard, I cried out: “Take that!” and shot into their midst.
2578𓀴
2579𓀴I must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and
2580𓀴the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted. Before they had time to
2581𓀴recover, I sent another ball over their heads; and at my third shot
2582𓀴(which went as wide as the second) the whole party threw down the yard
2583𓀴and ran for it.
2584𓀴
2585𓀴Then I looked round again into the deck-house. The whole place was full
2586𓀴of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with
2587𓀴the noise of the shots. But there was Alan, standing as before; only
2588𓀴now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled
2589𓀴with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be
2590𓀴invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands
2591𓀴and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking
2592𓀴slowly lower, with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of
2593𓀴those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily
2594𓀴out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it.
2595𓀴
2596𓀴“There’s one of your Whigs for ye!” cried Alan; and then turning to me,
2597𓀴he asked if I had done much execution.
2598𓀴
2599𓀴I told him I had winged one, and thought it was the captain.
2600𓀴
2601𓀴“And I’ve settled two,” says he. “No, there’s not enough blood let;
2602𓀴they’ll be back again. To your watch, David. This was but a dram before
2603𓀴meat.”
2604𓀴
2605𓀴I settled back to my place, re-charging the three pistols I had fired,
2606𓀴and keeping watch with both eye and ear.
2607𓀴
2608𓀴Our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck, and that so loudly
2609𓀴that I could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas.
2610𓀴
2611𓀴“It was Shuan bauchled[15] it,” I heard one say.
2612𓀴
2613𓀴     [15] Bungled.
2614𓀴
2615𓀴And another answered him with a “Wheesht, man! He’s paid the piper.”
2616𓀴
2617𓀴After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only
2618𓀴now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan,
2619𓀴and first one and then another answered him briefly, like men taking
2620𓀴orders. By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan.
2621𓀴
2622𓀴“It’s what we have to pray for,” said he. “Unless we can give them a
2623𓀴good distaste of us, and done with it, there’ll be nae sleep for either
2624𓀴you or me. But this time, mind, they’ll be in earnest.”
2625𓀴
2626𓀴By this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen
2627𓀴and wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was
2628𓀴frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing
2629𓀴else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in
2630𓀴me; and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing
2631𓀴of men’s clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking
2632𓀴their places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out
2633𓀴aloud.
2634𓀴
2635𓀴All this was upon Alan’s side; and I had begun to think my share of the
2636𓀴fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above
2637𓀴me.
2638𓀴
2639𓀴Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal.
2640𓀴A knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door;
2641𓀴and at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a
2642𓀴thousand pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor.
2643𓀴Before he got his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might
2644𓀴have shot him, too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole
2645𓀴flesh misgave me, and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have
2646𓀴flown.
2647𓀴
2648𓀴He had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol,
2649𓀴whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at
2650𓀴that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to
2651𓀴the same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the
2652𓀴body. He gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The
2653𓀴foot of a second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight,
2654𓀴struck me at the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another
2655𓀴pistol and shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through
2656𓀴and tumbled in a lump on his companion’s body. There was no talk of
2657𓀴missing, any more than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to
2658𓀴the very place and fired.
2659𓀴
2660𓀴I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout
2661𓀴as if for help, and that brought me to my senses.
2662𓀴
2663𓀴He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was
2664𓀴engaged with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the
2665𓀴body. Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like
2666𓀴a leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was
2667𓀴thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my
2668𓀴cutlass, fell on them in flank.
2669𓀴
2670𓀴But I had not time to be of help. The wrestler dropped at last; and
2671𓀴Alan, leaping back to get his distance, ran upon the others like a
2672𓀴bull, roaring as he went. They broke before him like water, turning, and
2673𓀴running, and falling one against another in their haste. The sword
2674𓀴in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing
2675𓀴enemies; and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt. I was
2676𓀴still thinking we were lost, when lo! they were all gone, and Alan was
2677𓀴driving them along the deck as a sheep-dog chases sheep.
2678𓀴
2679𓀴Yet he was no sooner out than he was back again, being as cautious as he
2680𓀴was brave; and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as
2681𓀴if he was still behind them; and we heard them tumble one upon another
2682𓀴into the forecastle, and clap-to the hatch upon the top.
2683𓀴
2684𓀴The round-house was like a shambles; three were dead inside, another
2685𓀴lay in his death agony across the threshold; and there were Alan and I
2686𓀴victorious and unhurt.
2687𓀴
2688𓀴He came up to me with open arms. “Come to my arms!” he cried, and
2689𓀴embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks. “David,” said he, “I love
2690𓀴you like a brother. And O, man,” he cried in a kind of ecstasy, “am I no
2691𓀴a bonny fighter?”
2692𓀴
2693𓀴Thereupon he turned to the four enemies, passed his sword clean through
2694𓀴each of them, and tumbled them out of doors one after the other. As he
2695𓀴did so, he kept humming and singing and whistling to himself, like a man
2696𓀴trying to recall an air; only what _he_ was trying was to make one. All
2697𓀴the while, the flush was in his face, and his eyes were as bright as a
2698𓀴five-year-old child’s with a new toy. And presently he sat down upon the
2699𓀴table, sword in hand; the air that he was making all the time began to
2700𓀴run a little clearer, and then clearer still; and then out he burst with
2701𓀴a great voice into a Gaelic song.
2702𓀴
2703𓀴I have translated it here, not in verse (of which I have no skill) but
2704𓀴at least in the king’s English.
2705𓀴
2706𓀴He sang it often afterwards, and the thing became popular; so that I
2707𓀴have heard it and had it explained to me, many’s the time.
2708𓀴
2709𓀴    “This is the song of the sword of Alan;
2710𓀴    The smith made it,
2711𓀴    The fire set it;
2712𓀴    Now it shines in the hand of Alan Breck.
2713𓀴
2714𓀴    “Their eyes were many and bright,
2715𓀴    Swift were they to behold,
2716𓀴    Many the hands they guided:
2717𓀴    The sword was alone.
2718𓀴
2719𓀴    “The dun deer troop over the hill,
2720𓀴    They are many, the hill is one;
2721𓀴    The dun deer vanish,
2722𓀴    The hill remains.
2723𓀴
2724𓀴    “Come to me from the hills of heather,
2725𓀴    Come from the isles of the sea.
2726𓀴    O far-beholding eagles,
2727𓀴    Here is your meat.”
2728𓀴
2729𓀴Now this song which he made (both words and music) in the hour of our
2730𓀴victory, is something less than just to me, who stood beside him in
2731𓀴the tussle. Mr. Shuan and five more were either killed outright or
2732𓀴thoroughly disabled; but of these, two fell by my hand, the two that
2733𓀴came by the skylight. Four more were hurt, and of that number, one (and
2734𓀴he not the least important) got his hurt from me. So that, altogether,
2735𓀴I did my fair share both of the killing and the wounding, and might have
2736𓀴claimed a place in Alan’s verses. But poets have to think upon their
2737𓀴rhymes; and in good prose talk, Alan always did me more than justice.
2738𓀴
2739𓀴In the meanwhile, I was innocent of any wrong being done me. For not
2740𓀴only I knew no word of the Gaelic; but what with the long suspense of
2741𓀴the waiting, and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting,
2742𓀴and more than all, the horror I had of some of my own share in it, the
2743𓀴thing was no sooner over than I was glad to stagger to a seat. There was
2744𓀴that tightness on my chest that I could hardly breathe; the thought
2745𓀴of the two men I had shot sat upon me like a nightmare; and all upon a
2746𓀴sudden, and before I had a guess of what was coming, I began to sob and
2747𓀴cry like any child.
2748𓀴
2749𓀴Alan clapped my shoulder, and said I was a brave lad and wanted nothing
2750𓀴but a sleep.
2751𓀴
2752𓀴“I’ll take the first watch,” said he. “Ye’ve done well by me, David,
2753𓀴first and last; and I wouldn’t lose you for all Appin--no, nor for
2754𓀴Breadalbane.”
2755𓀴
2756𓀴So I made up my bed on the floor; and he took the first spell, pistol
2757𓀴in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain’s watch upon the
2758𓀴wall. Then he roused me up, and I took my turn of three hours; before
2759𓀴the end of which it was broad day, and a very quiet morning, with a
2760𓀴smooth, rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and
2761𓀴fro on the round-house floor, and a heavy rain that drummed upon the
2762𓀴roof. All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the
2763𓀴helm, I knew they had even no one at the tiller. Indeed (as I learned
2764𓀴afterwards) there were so many of them hurt or dead, and the rest in so
2765𓀴ill a temper, that Mr. Riach and the captain had to take turn and turn
2766𓀴like Alan and me, or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the
2767𓀴wiser. It was a mercy the night had fallen so still, for the wind had
2768𓀴gone down as soon as the rain began. Even as it was, I judged by the
2769𓀴wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round
2770𓀴the ship, that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of
2771𓀴the islands of the Hebrides; and at last, looking out of the door of the
2772𓀴round-house, I saw the great stone hills of Skye on the right hand, and,
2773𓀴a little more astern, the strange isle of Rum.

2777𓀴
2778𓀴CHAPTER XI
2779𓀴
2780𓀴THE CAPTAIN KNUCKLES UNDER
2781𓀴
2782𓀴
2783𓀴Alan and I sat down to breakfast about six of the clock. The floor was
2784𓀴covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood, which took away
2785𓀴my hunger. In all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable
2786𓀴but merry; having ousted the officers from their own cabin, and having
2787𓀴at command all the drink in the ship--both wine and spirits--and all the
2788𓀴dainty part of what was eatable, such as the pickles and the fine sort
2789𓀴of bread. This, of itself, was enough to set us in good humour, but the
2790𓀴richest part of it was this, that the two thirstiest men that ever came
2791𓀴out of Scotland (Mr. Shuan being dead) were now shut in the fore-part of
2792𓀴the ship and condemned to what they hated most--cold water.
2793𓀴
2794𓀴“And depend upon it,” Alan said, “we shall hear more of them ere long.
2795𓀴Ye may keep a man from the fighting, but never from his bottle.”
2796𓀴
2797𓀴We made good company for each other. Alan, indeed, expressed himself
2798𓀴most lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the
2799𓀴silver buttons from his coat.
2800𓀴
2801𓀴“I had them,” says he, “from my father, Duncan Stewart; and now give ye
2802𓀴one of them to be a keepsake for last night’s work. And wherever ye go
2803𓀴and show that button, the friends of Alan Breck will come around you.”
2804𓀴
2805𓀴He said this as if he had been Charlemagne, and commanded armies; and
2806𓀴indeed, much as I admired his courage, I was always in danger of smiling
2807𓀴at his vanity: in danger, I say, for had I not kept my countenance, I
2808𓀴would be afraid to think what a quarrel might have followed.
2809𓀴
2810𓀴As soon as we were through with our meal he rummaged in the captain’s
2811𓀴locker till he found a clothes-brush; and then taking off his coat,
2812𓀴began to visit his suit and brush away the stains, with such care and
2813𓀴labour as I supposed to have been only usual with women. To be sure, he
2814𓀴had no other; and, besides (as he said), it belonged to a king and so
2815𓀴behoved to be royally looked after.
2816𓀴
2817𓀴For all that, when I saw what care he took to pluck out the threads
2818𓀴where the button had been cut away, I put a higher value on his gift.
2819𓀴
2820𓀴He was still so engaged when we were hailed by Mr. Riach from the deck,
2821𓀴asking for a parley; and I, climbing through the skylight and sitting on
2822𓀴the edge of it, pistol in hand and with a bold front, though inwardly in
2823𓀴fear of broken glass, hailed him back again and bade him speak out. He
2824𓀴came to the edge of the round-house, and stood on a coil of rope, so
2825𓀴that his chin was on a level with the roof; and we looked at each other
2826𓀴awhile in silence. Mr. Riach, as I do not think he had been very forward
2827𓀴in the battle, so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the
2828𓀴cheek: but he looked out of heart and very weary, having been all night
2829𓀴afoot, either standing watch or doctoring the wounded.
2830𓀴
2831𓀴“This is a bad job,” said he at last, shaking his head.
2832𓀴
2833𓀴“It was none of our choosing,” said I.
2834𓀴
2835𓀴“The captain,” says he, “would like to speak with your friend. They
2836𓀴might speak at the window.”
2837𓀴
2838𓀴“And how do we know what treachery he means?” cried I.
2839𓀴
2840𓀴“He means none, David,” returned Mr. Riach, “and if he did, I’ll tell ye
2841𓀴the honest truth, we couldnae get the men to follow.”
2842𓀴
2843𓀴“Is that so?” said I.
2844𓀴
2845𓀴“I’ll tell ye more than that,” said he. “It’s not only the men; it’s me.
2846𓀴I’m frich’ened, Davie.” And he smiled across at me. “No,” he continued,
2847𓀴“what we want is to be shut of him.”
2848𓀴
2849𓀴Thereupon I consulted with Alan, and the parley was agreed to and
2850𓀴parole given upon either side; but this was not the whole of Mr. Riach’s
2851𓀴business, and he now begged me for a dram with such instancy and such
2852𓀴reminders of his former kindness, that at last I handed him a pannikin
2853𓀴with about a gill of brandy. He drank a part, and then carried the rest
2854𓀴down upon the deck, to share it (I suppose) with his superior.
2855𓀴
2856𓀴A little after, the captain came (as was agreed) to one of the windows,
2857𓀴and stood there in the rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern
2858𓀴and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.
2859𓀴
2860𓀴Alan at once held a pistol in his face.
2861𓀴
2862𓀴“Put that thing up!” said the captain. “Have I not passed my word, sir?
2863𓀴or do ye seek to affront me?”
2864𓀴
2865𓀴“Captain,” says Alan, “I doubt your word is a breakable. Last night ye
2866𓀴haggled and argle-bargled like an apple-wife; and then passed me your
2867𓀴word, and gave me your hand to back it; and ye ken very well what was
2868𓀴the upshot. Be damned to your word!” says he.
2869𓀴
2870𓀴“Well, well, sir,” said the captain, “ye’ll get little good by
2871𓀴swearing.” (And truly that was a fault of which the captain was quite
2872𓀴free.) “But we have other things to speak,” he continued, bitterly.
2873𓀴“Ye’ve made a sore hash of my brig; I haven’t hands enough left to work
2874𓀴her; and my first officer (whom I could ill spare) has got your sword
2875𓀴throughout his vitals, and passed without speech. There is nothing left
2876𓀴me, sir, but to put back into the port of Glasgow after hands; and there
2877𓀴(by your leave) ye will find them that are better able to talk to you.”
2878𓀴
2879𓀴“Ay?” said Alan; “and faith, I’ll have a talk with them mysel’! Unless
2880𓀴there’s naebody speaks English in that town, I have a bonny tale for
2881𓀴them. Fifteen tarry sailors upon the one side, and a man and a halfling
2882𓀴boy upon the other! O, man, it’s peetiful!”
2883𓀴
2884𓀴Hoseason flushed red.
2885𓀴
2886𓀴“No,” continued Alan, “that’ll no do. Ye’ll just have to set me ashore
2887𓀴as we agreed.”
2888𓀴
2889𓀴“Ay,” said Hoseason, “but my first officer is dead--ye ken best how.
2890𓀴There’s none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast, sir; and it’s
2891𓀴one very dangerous to ships.”
2892𓀴
2893𓀴“I give ye your choice,” says Alan. “Set me on dry ground in Appin,
2894𓀴or Ardgour, or in Morven, or Arisaig, or Morar; or, in brief, where ye
2895𓀴please, within thirty miles of my own country; except in a country of
2896𓀴the Campbells. That’s a broad target. If ye miss that, ye must be as
2897𓀴feckless at the sailoring as I have found ye at the fighting. Why, my
2898𓀴poor country people in their bit cobles[16] pass from island to island in
2899𓀴all weathers, ay, and by night too, for the matter of that.”
2900𓀴
2901𓀴     [16] Coble: a small boat used in fishing.
2902𓀴
2903𓀴“A coble’s not a ship, sir,” said the captain. “It has nae draught of
2904𓀴water.”
2905𓀴
2906𓀴“Well, then, to Glasgow if ye list!” says Alan. “We’ll have the laugh of
2907𓀴ye at the least.”
2908𓀴
2909𓀴“My mind runs little upon laughing,” said the captain. “But all this
2910𓀴will cost money, sir.”
2911𓀴
2912𓀴“Well, sir,” says Alan, “I am nae weathercock. Thirty guineas, if ye land
2913𓀴me on the sea-side; and sixty, if ye put me in the Linnhe Loch.”
2914𓀴
2915𓀴“But see, sir, where we lie, we are but a few hours’ sail from
2916𓀴Ardnamurchan,” said Hoseason. “Give me sixty, and I’ll set ye there.”
2917𓀴
2918𓀴“And I’m to wear my brogues and run jeopardy of the red-coats to please
2919𓀴you?” cries Alan. “No, sir; if ye want sixty guineas earn them, and set
2920𓀴me in my own country.”
2921𓀴
2922𓀴“It’s to risk the brig, sir,” said the captain, “and your own lives
2923𓀴along with her.”
2924𓀴
2925𓀴“Take it or want it,” says Alan.
2926𓀴
2927𓀴“Could ye pilot us at all?” asked the captain, who was frowning to
2928𓀴himself.
2929𓀴
2930𓀴“Well, it’s doubtful,” said Alan. “I’m more of a fighting man (as ye
2931𓀴have seen for yoursel’) than a sailor-man. But I have been often enough
2932𓀴picked up and set down upon this coast, and should ken something of the
2933𓀴lie of it.”
2934𓀴
2935𓀴The captain shook his head, still frowning.
2936𓀴
2937𓀴“If I had lost less money on this unchancy cruise,” says he, “I would
2938𓀴see you in a rope’s end before I risked my brig, sir. But be it as ye
2939𓀴will. As soon as I get a slant of wind (and there’s some coming, or I’m
2940𓀴the more mistaken) I’ll put it in hand. But there’s one thing more. We
2941𓀴may meet in with a king’s ship and she may lay us aboard, sir, with no
2942𓀴blame of mine: they keep the cruisers thick upon this coast, ye ken who
2943𓀴for. Now, sir, if that was to befall, ye might leave the money.”
2944𓀴
2945𓀴“Captain,” says Alan, “if ye see a pennant, it shall be your part to
2946𓀴run away. And now, as I hear you’re a little short of brandy in the
2947𓀴fore-part, I’ll offer ye a change: a bottle of brandy against two
2948𓀴buckets of water.”
2949𓀴
2950𓀴That was the last clause of the treaty, and was duly executed on both
2951𓀴sides; so that Alan and I could at last wash out the round-house and be
2952𓀴quit of the memorials of those whom we had slain, and the captain and
2953𓀴Mr. Riach could be happy again in their own way, the name of which was
2954𓀴drink.

2959𓀴CHAPTER XII
2960𓀴
2961𓀴I HEAR OF THE “RED FOX”
2962𓀴
2963𓀴
2964𓀴Before we had done cleaning out the round-house, a breeze sprang up from
2965𓀴a little to the east of north. This blew off the rain and brought out
2966𓀴the sun.
2967𓀴
2968𓀴And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map.
2969𓀴On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan’s boat, we had been
2970𓀴running through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay
2971𓀴becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle
2972𓀴Eriska in the chain of the Long Island. Now to get from there to the
2973𓀴Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of
2974𓀴Mull. But the captain had no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so
2975𓀴deep among the islands; and the wind serving well, he preferred to go by
2976𓀴west of Tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great Isle of
2977𓀴Mull.
2978𓀴
2979𓀴All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than
2980𓀴died down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the
2981𓀴outer Hebrides. Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to
2982𓀴the west of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and
2983𓀴were much rolled about. But after nightfall, when we had turned the end
2984𓀴of Tiree and began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.
2985𓀴
2986𓀴Meanwhile, the early part of the day, before the swell came up, was
2987𓀴very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright sunshine and with
2988𓀴many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan and I sat in the
2989𓀴round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight
2990𓀴astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain’s fine tobacco. It was
2991𓀴at this time we heard each other’s stories, which was the more important
2992𓀴to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which
2993𓀴I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great
2994𓀴rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he
2995𓀴went upon the heather.
2996𓀴
2997𓀴It was I that showed the example, telling him all my misfortune; which
2998𓀴he heard with great good-nature. Only, when I came to mention that good
2999𓀴friend of mine, Mr. Campbell the minister, Alan fired up and cried out
3000𓀴that he hated all that were of that name.
3001𓀴
3002𓀴“Why,” said I, “he is a man you should be proud to give your hand to.”
3003𓀴
3004𓀴“I know nothing I would help a Campbell to,” says he, “unless it was a
3005𓀴leaden bullet. I would hunt all of that name like blackcocks. If I lay
3006𓀴dying, I would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at
3007𓀴one.”
3008𓀴
3009𓀴“Why, Alan,” I cried, “what ails ye at the Campbells?”
3010𓀴
3011𓀴“Well,” says he, “ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the
3012𓀴Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got
3013𓀴lands of us by treachery--but never with the sword,” he cried loudly,
3014𓀴and with the word brought down his fist upon the table. But I paid the
3015𓀴less attention to this, for I knew it was usually said by those who have
3016𓀴the underhand. “There’s more than that,” he continued, “and all in the
3017𓀴same story: lying words, lying papers, tricks fit for a peddler, and the
3018𓀴show of what’s legal over all, to make a man the more angry.”
3019𓀴
3020𓀴“You that are so wasteful of your buttons,” said I, “I can hardly think
3021𓀴you would be a good judge of business.”
3022𓀴
3023𓀴“Ah!” says he, falling again to smiling, “I got my wastefulness from
3024𓀴the same man I got the buttons from; and that was my poor father, Duncan
3025𓀴Stewart, grace be to him! He was the prettiest man of his kindred; and
3026𓀴the best swordsman in the Hielands, David, and that is the same as to
3027𓀴say, in all the world, I should ken, for it was him that taught me.
3028𓀴He was in the Black Watch, when first it was mustered; and, like other
3029𓀴gentlemen privates, had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for
3030𓀴him on the march. Well, the King, it appears, was wishful to see Hieland
3031𓀴swordsmanship; and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to
3032𓀴London town, to let him see it at the best. So they were had into the
3033𓀴palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch,
3034𓀴before King George and Queen Carline, and the Butcher Cumberland, and
3035𓀴many more of whom I havenae mind. And when they were through, the King
3036𓀴(for all he was a rank usurper) spoke them fair and gave each man three
3037𓀴guineas in his hand. Now, as they were going out of the palace, they
3038𓀴had a porter’s lodge to go by; and it came in on my father, as he was
3039𓀴perhaps the first private Hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that
3040𓀴door, it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of
3041𓀴their quality. So he gives the King’s three guineas into the man’s hand,
3042𓀴as if it was his common custom; the three others that came behind him
3043𓀴did the same; and there they were on the street, never a penny the
3044𓀴better for their pains. Some say it was one, that was the first to fee
3045𓀴the King’s porter; and some say it was another; but the truth of it is,
3046𓀴that it was Duncan Stewart, as I am willing to prove with either sword
3047𓀴or pistol. And that was the father that I had, God rest him!”
3048𓀴
3049𓀴“I think he was not the man to leave you rich,” said I.
3050𓀴
3051𓀴“And that’s true,” said Alan. “He left me my breeks to cover me, and
3052𓀴little besides. And that was how I came to enlist, which was a black
3053𓀴spot upon my character at the best of times, and would still be a sore
3054𓀴job for me if I fell among the red-coats.”
3055𓀴
3056𓀴“What,” cried I, “were you in the English army?”
3057𓀴
3058𓀴“That was I,” said Alan. “But I deserted to the right side at Preston
3059𓀴Pans--and that’s some comfort.”
3060𓀴
3061𓀴I could scarcely share this view: holding desertion under arms for an
3062𓀴unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I was so young, I was wiser
3063𓀴than say my thought. “Dear, dear,” says I, “the punishment is death.”
3064𓀴
3065𓀴“Ay” said he, “if they got hands on me, it would be a short shrift and
3066𓀴a lang tow for Alan! But I have the King of France’s commission in my
3067𓀴pocket, which would aye be some protection.”
3068𓀴
3069𓀴“I misdoubt it much,” said I.
3070𓀴
3071𓀴“I have doubts mysel’,” said Alan drily.
3072𓀴
3073𓀴“And, good heaven, man,” cried I, “you that are a condemned rebel, and a
3074𓀴deserter, and a man of the French King’s--what tempts ye back into this
3075𓀴country? It’s a braving of Providence.”
3076𓀴
3077𓀴“Tut!” says Alan, “I have been back every year since forty-six!”
3078𓀴
3079𓀴“And what brings ye, man?” cried I.
3080𓀴
3081𓀴“Well, ye see, I weary for my friends and country,” said he. “France is
3082𓀴a braw place, nae doubt; but I weary for the heather and the deer. And
3083𓀴then I have bit things that I attend to. Whiles I pick up a few lads
3084𓀴to serve the King of France: recruits, ye see; and that’s aye a
3085𓀴little money. But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief,
3086𓀴Ardshiel.”
3087𓀴
3088𓀴“I thought they called your chief Appin,” said I.
3089𓀴
3090𓀴“Ay, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan,” said he, which scarcely
3091𓀴cleared my mind. “Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a
3092𓀴man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought
3093𓀴down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that
3094𓀴had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes
3095𓀴of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a
3096𓀴kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family
3097𓀴and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of
3098𓀴Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in
3099𓀴that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King
3100𓀴George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and
3101𓀴what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the
3102𓀴poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I’m the
3103𓀴hand that carries it.” And he struck the belt about his body, so that
3104𓀴the guineas rang.
3105𓀴
3106𓀴“Do they pay both?” cried I.
3107𓀴
3108𓀴“Ay, David, both,” says he.
3109𓀴
3110𓀴“What! two rents?” I repeated.
3111𓀴
3112𓀴“Ay, David,” said he. “I told a different tale to yon captain man; but
3113𓀴this is the truth of it. And it’s wonderful to me how little pressure
3114𓀴is needed. But that’s the handiwork of my good kinsman and my father’s
3115𓀴friend, James of the Glens: James Stewart, that is: Ardshiel’s
3116𓀴half-brother. He it is that gets the money in, and does the management.”
3117𓀴
3118𓀴This was the first time I heard the name of that James Stewart, who was
3119𓀴afterwards so famous at the time of his hanging. But I took little heed
3120𓀴at the moment, for all my mind was occupied with the generosity of these
3121𓀴poor Highlanders.
3122𓀴
3123𓀴“I call it noble,” I cried. “I’m a Whig, or little better; but I call it
3124𓀴noble.”
3125𓀴
3126𓀴“Ay” said he, “ye’re a Whig, but ye’re a gentleman; and that’s what does
3127𓀴it. Now, if ye were one of the cursed race of Campbell, ye would gnash
3128𓀴your teeth to hear tell of it. If ye were the Red Fox...” And at that
3129𓀴name, his teeth shut together, and he ceased speaking. I have seen many
3130𓀴a grim face, but never a grimmer than Alan’s when he had named the Red
3131𓀴Fox.
3132𓀴
3133𓀴“And who is the Red Fox?” I asked, daunted, but still curious.
3134𓀴
3135𓀴“Who is he?” cried Alan. “Well, and I’ll tell you that. When the men of
3136𓀴the clans were broken at Culloden, and the good cause went down, and the
3137𓀴horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north, Ardshiel
3138𓀴had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountains--he and his lady and his
3139𓀴bairns. A sair job we had of it before we got him shipped; and while he
3140𓀴still lay in the heather, the English rogues, that couldnae come at his
3141𓀴life, were striking at his rights. They stripped him of his powers; they
3142𓀴stripped him of his lands; they plucked the weapons from the hands of
3143𓀴his clansmen, that had borne arms for thirty centuries; ay, and the very
3144𓀴clothes off their backs--so that it’s now a sin to wear a tartan plaid,
3145𓀴and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs.
3146𓀴One thing they couldnae kill. That was the love the clansmen bore their
3147𓀴chief. These guineas are the proof of it. And now, in there steps a man,
3148𓀴a Campbell, red-headed Colin of Glenure----”
3149𓀴
3150𓀴“Is that him you call the Red Fox?” said I.
3151𓀴
3152𓀴“Will ye bring me his brush?” cries Alan, fiercely. “Ay, that’s the man.
3153𓀴In he steps, and gets papers from King George, to be so-called King’s
3154𓀴factor on the lands of Appin. And at first he sings small, and is
3155𓀴hail-fellow-well-met with Sheamus--that’s James of the Glens, my
3156𓀴chieftain’s agent. But by-and-by, that came to his ears that I have just
3157𓀴told you; how the poor commons of Appin, the farmers and the crofters
3158𓀴and the boumen, were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent,
3159𓀴and send it over-seas for Ardshiel and his poor bairns. What was it ye
3160𓀴called it, when I told ye?”
3161𓀴
3162𓀴“I called it noble, Alan,” said I.
3163𓀴
3164𓀴“And you little better than a common Whig!” cries Alan. “But when it
3165𓀴came to Colin Roy, the black Campbell blood in him ran wild. He sat
3166𓀴gnashing his teeth at the wine table. What! should a Stewart get a bite
3167𓀴of bread, and him not be able to prevent it? Ah! Red Fox, if ever I
3168𓀴hold you at a gun’s end, the Lord have pity upon ye!” (Alan stopped to
3169𓀴swallow down his anger.) “Well, David, what does he do? He declares all
3170𓀴the farms to let. And, thinks he, in his black heart, ‘I’ll soon get
3171𓀴other tenants that’ll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs’
3172𓀴(for these are all names in my clan, David); ‘and then,’ thinks he,
3173𓀴‘Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.’”
3174𓀴
3175𓀴“Well,” said I, “what followed?”
3176𓀴
3177𓀴Alan laid down his pipe, which he had long since suffered to go out, and
3178𓀴set his two hands upon his knees.
3179𓀴
3180𓀴“Ay,” said he, “ye’ll never guess that! For these same Stewarts, and
3181𓀴Maccolls, and Macrobs (that had two rents to pay, one to King George
3182𓀴by stark force, and one to Ardshiel by natural kindness) offered him a
3183𓀴better price than any Campbell in all broad Scotland; and far he
3184𓀴sent seeking them--as far as to the sides of Clyde and the cross of
3185𓀴Edinburgh--seeking, and fleeching, and begging them to come, where there
3186𓀴was a Stewart to be starved and a red-headed hound of a Campbell to be
3187𓀴pleasured!”
3188𓀴
3189𓀴“Well, Alan,” said I, “that is a strange story, and a fine one, too. And
3190𓀴Whig as I may be, I am glad the man was beaten.”
3191𓀴
3192𓀴“Him beaten?” echoed Alan. “It’s little ye ken of Campbells, and less
3193𓀴of the Red Fox. Him beaten? No: nor will be, till his blood’s on the
3194𓀴hillside! But if the day comes, David man, that I can find time and
3195𓀴leisure for a bit of hunting, there grows not enough heather in all
3196𓀴Scotland to hide him from my vengeance!”
3197𓀴
3198𓀴“Man Alan,” said I, “ye are neither very wise nor very Christian to
3199𓀴blow off so many words of anger. They will do the man ye call the Fox no
3200𓀴harm, and yourself no good. Tell me your tale plainly out. What did he
3201𓀴next?”
3202𓀴
3203𓀴“And that’s a good observe, David,” said Alan. “Troth and indeed,
3204𓀴they will do him no harm; the more’s the pity! And barring that about
3205𓀴Christianity (of which my opinion is quite otherwise, or I would be nae
3206𓀴Christian), I am much of your mind.”
3207𓀴
3208𓀴“Opinion here or opinion there,” said I, “it’s a kent thing that
3209𓀴Christianity forbids revenge.”
3210𓀴
3211𓀴“Ay” said he, “it’s well seen it was a Campbell taught ye! It would be
3212𓀴a convenient world for them and their sort, if there was no such a thing
3213𓀴as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush! But that’s nothing to the
3214𓀴point. This is what he did.”
3215𓀴
3216𓀴“Ay” said I, “come to that.”
3217𓀴
3218𓀴“Well, David,” said he, “since he couldnae be rid of the loyal commons
3219𓀴by fair means, he swore he would be rid of them by foul. Ardshiel was to
3220𓀴starve: that was the thing he aimed at. And since them that fed him in
3221𓀴his exile wouldnae be bought out--right or wrong, he would drive them
3222𓀴out. Therefore he sent for lawyers, and papers, and red-coats to stand
3223𓀴at his back. And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and
3224𓀴tramp, every father’s son out of his father’s house, and out of the
3225𓀴place where he was bred and fed, and played when he was a callant. And
3226𓀴who are to succeed them? Bare-leggit beggars! King George is to whistle
3227𓀴for his rents; he maun dow with less; he can spread his butter thinner:
3228𓀴what cares Red Colin? If he can hurt Ardshiel, he has his wish; if he
3229𓀴can pluck the meat from my chieftain’s table, and the bit toys out of
3230𓀴his children’s hands, he will gang hame singing to Glenure!”
3231𓀴
3232𓀴“Let me have a word,” said I. “Be sure, if they take less rents, be
3233𓀴sure Government has a finger in the pie. It’s not this Campbell’s fault,
3234𓀴man--it’s his orders. And if ye killed this Colin to-morrow, what better
3235𓀴would ye be? There would be another factor in his shoes, as fast as spur
3236𓀴can drive.”
3237𓀴
3238𓀴“Ye’re a good lad in a fight,” said Alan; “but, man! ye have Whig blood
3239𓀴in ye!”
3240𓀴
3241𓀴He spoke kindly enough, but there was so much anger under his contempt
3242𓀴that I thought it was wise to change the conversation. I expressed my
3243𓀴wonder how, with the Highlands covered with troops, and guarded like
3244𓀴a city in a siege, a man in his situation could come and go without
3245𓀴arrest.
3246𓀴
3247𓀴“It’s easier than ye would think,” said Alan. “A bare hillside (ye see)
3248𓀴is like all one road; if there’s a sentry at one place, ye just go by
3249𓀴another. And then the heather’s a great help. And everywhere there are
3250𓀴friends’ houses and friends’ byres and haystacks. And besides, when folk
3251𓀴talk of a country covered with troops, it’s but a kind of a byword at
3252𓀴the best. A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles. I have
3253𓀴fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae, and killed a
3254𓀴fine trout; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another,
3255𓀴and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it,” said he,
3256𓀴and whistled me the air.
3257𓀴
3258𓀴“And then, besides,” he continued, “it’s no sae bad now as it was in
3259𓀴forty-six. The Hielands are what they call pacified. Small wonder, with
3260𓀴never a gun or a sword left from Cantyre to Cape Wrath, but what tenty[17]
3261𓀴folk have hidden in their thatch! But what I would like to ken, David,
3262𓀴is just how long? Not long, ye would think, with men like Ardshiel in
3263𓀴exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing
3264𓀴the poor at home. But it’s a kittle thing to decide what folk’ll bear,
3265𓀴and what they will not. Or why would Red Colin be riding his horse all
3266𓀴over my poor country of Appin, and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in
3267𓀴him?”
3268𓀴
3269𓀴     [17] Careful.
3270𓀴
3271𓀴And with this Alan fell into a muse, and for a long time sate very sad
3272𓀴and silent.
3273𓀴
3274𓀴I will add the rest of what I have to say about my friend, that he
3275𓀴was skilled in all kinds of music, but principally pipe-music; was a
3276𓀴well-considered poet in his own tongue; had read several books both in
3277𓀴French and English; was a dead shot, a good angler, and an excellent
3278𓀴fencer with the small sword as well as with his own particular weapon.
3279𓀴For his faults, they were on his face, and I now knew them all. But
3280𓀴the worst of them, his childish propensity to take offence and to pick
3281𓀴quarrels, he greatly laid aside in my case, out of regard for the battle
3282𓀴of the round-house. But whether it was because I had done well myself,
3283𓀴or because I had been a witness of his own much greater prowess, is more
3284𓀴than I can tell. For though he had a great taste for courage in other
3285𓀴men, yet he admired it most in Alan Breck.

3290𓀴CHAPTER XIII
3291𓀴
3292𓀴THE LOSS OF THE BRIG
3293𓀴
3294𓀴
3295𓀴It was already late at night, and as dark as it ever would be at that
3296𓀴season of the year (and that is to say, it was still pretty bright),
3297𓀴when Hoseason clapped his head into the round-house door.
3298𓀴
3299𓀴“Here,” said he, “come out and see if ye can pilot.”
3300𓀴
3301𓀴“Is this one of your tricks?” asked Alan.
3302𓀴
3303𓀴“Do I look like tricks?” cries the captain. “I have other things to
3304𓀴think of--my brig’s in danger!”
3305𓀴
3306𓀴By the concerned look of his face, and, above all, by the sharp tones in
3307𓀴which he spoke of his brig, it was plain to both of us he was in deadly
3308𓀴earnest; and so Alan and I, with no great fear of treachery, stepped on
3309𓀴deck.
3310𓀴
3311𓀴The sky was clear; it blew hard, and was bitter cold; a great deal of
3312𓀴daylight lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly.
3313𓀴The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the
3314𓀴Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a
3315𓀴wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though
3316𓀴it was no good point of sailing for the _Covenant_, she tore through
3317𓀴the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the
3318𓀴westerly swell.
3319𓀴
3320𓀴Altogether it was no such ill night to keep the seas in; and I had begun
3321𓀴to wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon the captain, when the
3322𓀴brig rising suddenly on the top of a high swell, he pointed and cried to
3323𓀴us to look. Away on the lee bow, a thing like a fountain rose out of the
3324𓀴moonlit sea, and immediately after we heard a low sound of roaring.
3325𓀴
3326𓀴“What do ye call that?” asked the captain, gloomily.
3327𓀴
3328𓀴“The sea breaking on a reef,” said Alan. “And now ye ken where it is;
3329𓀴and what better would ye have?”
3330𓀴
3331𓀴“Ay,” said Hoseason, “if it was the only one.”
3332𓀴
3333𓀴And sure enough, just as he spoke there came a second fountain farther
3334𓀴to the south.
3335𓀴
3336𓀴“There!” said Hoseason. “Ye see for yourself. If I had kent of these
3337𓀴reefs, if I had had a chart, or if Shuan had been spared, it’s not sixty
3338𓀴guineas, no, nor six hundred, would have made me risk my brig in sic a
3339𓀴stoneyard! But you, sir, that was to pilot us, have ye never a word?”
3340𓀴
3341𓀴“I’m thinking,” said Alan, “these’ll be what they call the Torran
3342𓀴Rocks.”
3343𓀴
3344𓀴“Are there many of them?” says the captain.
3345𓀴
3346𓀴“Truly, sir, I am nae pilot,” said Alan; “but it sticks in my mind there
3347𓀴are ten miles of them.”
3348𓀴
3349𓀴Mr. Riach and the captain looked at each other.
3350𓀴
3351𓀴“There’s a way through them, I suppose?” said the captain.
3352𓀴
3353𓀴“Doubtless,” said Alan, “but where? But it somehow runs in my mind once
3354𓀴more that it is clearer under the land.”
3355𓀴
3356𓀴“So?” said Hoseason. “We’ll have to haul our wind then, Mr. Riach; we’ll
3357𓀴have to come as near in about the end of Mull as we can take her, sir;
3358𓀴and even then we’ll have the land to kep the wind off us, and that
3359𓀴stoneyard on our lee. Well, we’re in for it now, and may as well crack
3360𓀴on.”
3361𓀴
3362𓀴With that he gave an order to the steersman, and sent Riach to the
3363𓀴foretop. There were only five men on deck, counting the officers; these
3364𓀴being all that were fit (or, at least, both fit and willing) for their
3365𓀴work. So, as I say, it fell to Mr. Riach to go aloft, and he sat there
3366𓀴looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw.
3367𓀴
3368𓀴“The sea to the south is thick,” he cried; and then, after a while, “it
3369𓀴does seem clearer in by the land.”
3370𓀴
3371𓀴“Well, sir,” said Hoseason to Alan, “we’ll try your way of it. But I
3372𓀴think I might as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you’re right.”
3373𓀴
3374𓀴“Pray God I am!” says Alan to me. “But where did I hear it? Well, well,
3375𓀴it will be as it must.”
3376𓀴
3377𓀴As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here
3378𓀴and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to
3379𓀴change the course. Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was
3380𓀴so close on the brig’s weather board that when a sea burst upon it the
3381𓀴lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.
3382𓀴
3383𓀴The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day,
3384𓀴which was, perhaps, the more alarming. It showed me, too, the face of
3385𓀴the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the
3386𓀴other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and
3387𓀴looking and as steady as steel. Neither he nor Mr. Riach had shown
3388𓀴well in the fighting; but I saw they were brave in their own trade, and
3389𓀴admired them all the more because I found Alan very white.
3390𓀴
3391𓀴“Ochone, David,” says he, “this is no the kind of death I fancy!”
3392𓀴
3393𓀴“What, Alan!” I cried, “you’re not afraid?”
3394𓀴
3395𓀴“No,” said he, wetting his lips, “but you’ll allow, yourself, it’s a
3396𓀴cold ending.”
3397𓀴
3398𓀴By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a
3399𓀴reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and
3400𓀴begun to come alongside Mull. The tide at the tail of the land ran very
3401𓀴strong, and threw the brig about. Two hands were put to the helm, and
3402𓀴Hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help; and it was strange to
3403𓀴see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller, and it (like a
3404𓀴living thing) struggle against and drive them back. This would have
3405𓀴been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of
3406𓀴obstacles. Mr. Riach, besides, announced from the top that he saw clear
3407𓀴water ahead.
3408𓀴
3409𓀴“Ye were right,” said Hoseason to Alan. “Ye have saved the brig, sir.
3410𓀴I’ll mind that when we come to clear accounts.” And I believe he not
3411𓀴only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the
3412𓀴_Covenant_ hold in his affections.
3413𓀴
3414𓀴But this is matter only for conjecture, things having gone otherwise
3415𓀴than he forecast.
3416𓀴
3417𓀴“Keep her away a point,” sings out Mr. Riach. “Reef to windward!”
3418𓀴
3419𓀴And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind
3420𓀴out of her sails. She came round into the wind like a top, and the next
3421𓀴moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the
3422𓀴deck, and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.
3423𓀴
3424𓀴I was on my feet in a minute. The reef on which we had struck was close
3425𓀴in under the southwest end of Mull, off a little isle they call Earraid,
3426𓀴which lay low and black upon the larboard. Sometimes the swell broke
3427𓀴clean over us; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef, so
3428𓀴that we could hear her beat herself to pieces; and what with the great
3429𓀴noise of the sails, and the singing of the wind, and the flying of the
3430𓀴spray in the moonlight, and the sense of danger, I think my head must
3431𓀴have been partly turned, for I could scarcely understand the things I
3432𓀴saw.
3433𓀴
3434𓀴Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff, and,
3435𓀴still in the same blank, ran over to assist them; and as soon as I set
3436𓀴my hand to work, my mind came clear again. It was no very easy task, for
3437𓀴the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper, and the breaking of the
3438𓀴heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on; but we all
3439𓀴wrought like horses while we could.
3440𓀴
3441𓀴Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the
3442𓀴fore-scuttle and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in
3443𓀴their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved.
3444𓀴
3445𓀴The captain took no part. It seemed he was struck stupid. He stood
3446𓀴holding by the shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud
3447𓀴whenever the ship hammered on the rock. His brig was like wife and
3448𓀴child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of poor
3449𓀴Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with
3450𓀴her.
3451𓀴
3452𓀴All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other
3453𓀴thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it
3454𓀴was; and he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a
3455𓀴land of the Campbells.
3456𓀴
3457𓀴We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and
3458𓀴cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when
3459𓀴this man sang out pretty shrill: “For God’s sake, hold on!” We knew
3460𓀴by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough,
3461𓀴there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted
3462𓀴her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too
3463𓀴weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean
3464𓀴over the bulwarks into the sea.
3465𓀴
3466𓀴I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the
3467𓀴moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good. I
3468𓀴cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how
3469𓀴often I went down, or how often I came up again. All the while, I was
3470𓀴being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed
3471𓀴whole; and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither
3472𓀴sorry nor afraid.
3473𓀴
3474𓀴Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat.
3475𓀴And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to
3476𓀴myself.
3477𓀴
3478𓀴It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far
3479𓀴I had travelled from the brig. I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain
3480𓀴she was already out of cry. She was still holding together; but whether
3481𓀴or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low
3482𓀴down to see.
3483𓀴
3484𓀴While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between
3485𓀴us where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and
3486𓀴bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract
3487𓀴swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a
3488𓀴glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again. What it was I
3489𓀴had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know
3490𓀴it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so
3491𓀴fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that
3492𓀴play, had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.
3493𓀴
3494𓀴I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold
3495𓀴as well as of drowning. The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see
3496𓀴in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in
3497𓀴the rocks.
3498𓀴
3499𓀴“Well,” thought I to myself, “if I cannot get as far as that, it’s
3500𓀴strange!”
3501𓀴
3502𓀴I had no skill of swimming, Essen Water being small in our
3503𓀴neighbourhood; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms, and
3504𓀴kicked out with both feet, I soon begun to find that I was moving. Hard
3505𓀴work it was, and mortally slow; but in about an hour of kicking
3506𓀴and splashing, I had got well in between the points of a sandy bay
3507𓀴surrounded by low hills.
3508𓀴
3509𓀴The sea was here quite quiet; there was no sound of any surf; the moon
3510𓀴shone clear; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so
3511𓀴desert and desolate. But it was dry land; and when at last it grew so
3512𓀴shallow that I could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet, I
3513𓀴cannot tell if I was more tired or more grateful. Both, at least, I was:
3514𓀴tired as I never was before that night; and grateful to God as I trust I
3515𓀴have been often, though never with more cause.
3516𓀴
3517𓀴
3518𓀴
3519𓀴
3520𓀴CHAPTER XIV
3521𓀴
3522𓀴THE ISLET
3523𓀴
3524𓀴
3525𓀴With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures.
3526𓀴It was half-past twelve in the morning, and though the wind was broken
3527𓀴by the land, it was a cold night. I dared not sit down (for I thought
3528𓀴I should have frozen), but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon
3529𓀴the sand, bare-foot, and beating my breast with infinite weariness.
3530𓀴There was no sound of man or cattle; not a cock crew, though it was
3531𓀴about the hour of their first waking; only the surf broke outside in the
3532𓀴distance, which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend.
3533𓀴To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning, and in a place so
3534𓀴desert-like and lonesome, struck me with a kind of fear.
3535𓀴
3536𓀴As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a
3537𓀴hill--the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook--falling, the whole way,
3538𓀴between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another. When I
3539𓀴got to the top the dawn was come. There was no sign of the brig, which
3540𓀴must have lifted from the reef and sunk. The boat, too, was nowhere to
3541𓀴be seen. There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see
3542𓀴of the land was neither house nor man.
3543𓀴
3544𓀴I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look
3545𓀴longer at so empty a scene. What with my wet clothes and weariness, and
3546𓀴my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble
3547𓀴me without that. So I set off eastward along the south coast, hoping to
3548𓀴find a house where I might warm myself, and perhaps get news of those I
3549𓀴had lost. And at the worst, I considered the sun would soon rise and dry
3550𓀴my clothes.
3551𓀴
3552𓀴After a little, my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea, which
3553𓀴seemed to run pretty deep into the land; and as I had no means to get
3554𓀴across, I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it. It
3555𓀴was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of
3556𓀴Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross)
3557𓀴is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among. At first
3558𓀴the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see; but presently to my
3559𓀴surprise it began to widen out again. At this I scratched my head,
3560𓀴but had still no notion of the truth: until at last I came to a rising
3561𓀴ground, and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a
3562𓀴little barren isle, and cut off on every side by the salt seas.
3563𓀴
3564𓀴Instead of the sun rising to dry me, it came on to rain, with a thick
3565𓀴mist; so that my case was lamentable.
3566𓀴
3567𓀴I stood in the rain, and shivered, and wondered what to do, till it
3568𓀴occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable. Back I went to the
3569𓀴narrowest point and waded in. But not three yards from shore, I plumped
3570𓀴in head over ears; and if ever I was heard of more, it was rather by
3571𓀴God’s grace than my own prudence. I was no wetter (for that could hardly
3572𓀴be), but I was all the colder for this mishap; and having lost another
3573𓀴hope was the more unhappy.
3574𓀴
3575𓀴And now, all at once, the yard came in my head. What had carried me
3576𓀴through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek
3577𓀴in safety. With that I set off, undaunted, across the top of the isle,
3578𓀴to fetch and carry it back. It was a weary tramp in all ways, and if
3579𓀴hope had not buoyed me up, I must have cast myself down and given up.
3580𓀴Whether with the sea salt, or because I was growing fevered, I was
3581𓀴distressed with thirst, and had to stop, as I went, and drink the peaty
3582𓀴water out of the hags.
3583𓀴
3584𓀴I came to the bay at last, more dead than alive; and at the first
3585𓀴glance, I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left
3586𓀴it. In I went, for the third time, into the sea. The sand was smooth
3587𓀴and firm, and shelved gradually down, so that I could wade out till the
3588𓀴water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face.
3589𓀴But at that depth my feet began to leave me, and I durst venture in no
3590𓀴farther. As for the yard, I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet
3591𓀴beyond.
3592𓀴
3593𓀴I had borne up well until this last disappointment; but at that I came
3594𓀴ashore, and flung myself down upon the sands and wept.
3595𓀴
3596𓀴The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me,
3597𓀴that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people
3598𓀴cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of
3599𓀴things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose.
3600𓀴My case was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and
3601𓀴Alan’s silver button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of
3602𓀴knowledge as of means.
3603𓀴
3604𓀴I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the
3605𓀴rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I
3606𓀴could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be
3607𓀴needful. There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call
3608𓀴buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name. Of these two I made my
3609𓀴whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry
3610𓀴was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious.
3611𓀴
3612𓀴Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was something wrong
3613𓀴in the sea about my island. But at least I had no sooner eaten my first
3614𓀴meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long
3615𓀴time no better than dead. A second trial of the same food (indeed I had
3616𓀴no other) did better with me, and revived my strength. But as long as
3617𓀴I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten;
3618𓀴sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable
3619𓀴sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that
3620𓀴hurt me.
3621𓀴
3622𓀴All day it streamed rain; the island ran like a sop, there was no dry
3623𓀴spot to be found; and when I lay down that night, between two boulders
3624𓀴that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a bog.
3625𓀴
3626𓀴The second day I crossed the island to all sides. There was no one part
3627𓀴of it better than another; it was all desolate and rocky; nothing living
3628𓀴on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill, and the gulls
3629𓀴which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number. But the creek,
3630𓀴or strait, that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross, opened
3631𓀴out on the north into a bay, and the bay again opened into the Sound of
3632𓀴Iona; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my
3633𓀴home; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot,
3634𓀴I must have burst out weeping.
3635𓀴
3636𓀴I had good reasons for my choice. There was in this part of the isle a
3637𓀴little hut of a house like a pig’s hut, where fishers used to sleep when
3638𓀴they came there upon their business; but the turf roof of it had fallen
3639𓀴entirely in; so that the hut was of no use to me, and gave me less
3640𓀴shelter than my rocks. What was more important, the shell-fish on which
3641𓀴I lived grew there in great plenty; when the tide was out I could gather
3642𓀴a peck at a time: and this was doubtless a convenience. But the other
3643𓀴reason went deeper. I had become in no way used to the horrid solitude
3644𓀴of the isle, but still looked round me on all sides (like a man that
3645𓀴was hunted), between fear and hope that I might see some human creature
3646𓀴coming. Now, from a little up the hillside over the bay, I could catch a
3647𓀴sight of the great, ancient church and the roofs of the people’s houses
3648𓀴in Iona. And on the other hand, over the low country of the Ross, I saw
3649𓀴smoke go up, morning and evening, as if from a homestead in a hollow of
3650𓀴the land.
3651𓀴
3652𓀴I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold, and had my head
3653𓀴half turned with loneliness; and think of the fireside and the
3654𓀴company, till my heart burned. It was the same with the roofs of Iona.
3655𓀴Altogether, this sight I had of men’s homes and comfortable lives,
3656𓀴although it put a point on my own sufferings, yet it kept hope alive,
3657𓀴and helped me to eat my raw shell-fish (which had soon grown to be a
3658𓀴disgust), and saved me from the sense of horror I had whenever I was
3659𓀴quite alone with dead rocks, and fowls, and the rain, and the cold sea.
3660𓀴
3661𓀴I say it kept hope alive; and indeed it seemed impossible that I should
3662𓀴be left to die on the shores of my own country, and within view of a
3663𓀴church-tower and the smoke of men’s houses. But the second day passed;
3664𓀴and though as long as the light lasted I kept a bright look-out for
3665𓀴boats on the Sound or men passing on the Ross, no help came near me. It
3666𓀴still rained, and I turned in to sleep, as wet as ever, and with a cruel
3667𓀴sore throat, but a little comforted, perhaps, by having said good-night
3668𓀴to my next neighbours, the people of Iona.
3669𓀴
3670𓀴Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the
3671𓀴year in the climate of England than in any other. This was very like a
3672𓀴king, with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes. But he must
3673𓀴have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that
3674𓀴miserable isle. It was the height of the summer; yet it rained for more
3675𓀴than twenty-four hours, and did not clear until the afternoon of the
3676𓀴third day.
3677𓀴
3678𓀴This was the day of incidents. In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck
3679𓀴with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the
3680𓀴island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before
3681𓀴he trotted off upon the other side. I supposed he must have swum the
3682𓀴strait; though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than
3683𓀴I could fancy.
3684𓀴
3685𓀴A little after, as I was jumping about after my limpets, I was startled
3686𓀴by a guinea-piece, which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off
3687𓀴into the sea. When the sailors gave me my money again, they kept back
3688𓀴not only about a third of the whole sum, but my father’s leather purse;
3689𓀴so that from that day out, I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a
3690𓀴button. I now saw there must be a hole, and clapped my hand to the place
3691𓀴in a great hurry. But this was to lock the stable door after the steed
3692𓀴was stolen. I had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty
3693𓀴pounds; now I found no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver
3694𓀴shilling.
3695𓀴
3696𓀴It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after, where it lay
3697𓀴shining on a piece of turf. That made a fortune of three pounds and four
3698𓀴shillings, English money, for a lad, the rightful heir of an estate, and
3699𓀴now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands.
3700𓀴
3701𓀴This state of my affairs dashed me still further; and, indeed my plight
3702𓀴on that third morning was truly pitiful. My clothes were beginning to
3703𓀴rot; my stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my
3704𓀴shanks went naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual
3705𓀴soaking; my throat was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my
3706𓀴heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that
3707𓀴the very sight of it came near to sicken me.
3708𓀴
3709𓀴And yet the worst was not yet come.
3710𓀴
3711𓀴There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid, which (because
3712𓀴it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was much in the habit of
3713𓀴frequenting; not that ever I stayed in one place, save when asleep, my
3714𓀴misery giving me no rest. Indeed, I wore myself down with continual and
3715𓀴aimless goings and comings in the rain.
3716𓀴
3717𓀴As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top of that
3718𓀴rock to dry myself. The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I cannot
3719𓀴tell. It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had
3720𓀴begun to despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh
3721𓀴interest. On the south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and
3722𓀴hid the open ocean, so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon
3723𓀴that side, and I be none the wiser.
3724𓀴
3725𓀴Well, all of a sudden, a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers
3726𓀴aboard of it, came flying round that corner of the isle, bound for Iona.
3727𓀴I shouted out, and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my
3728𓀴hands and prayed to them. They were near enough to hear--I could even
3729𓀴see the colour of their hair; and there was no doubt but they observed
3730𓀴me, for they cried out in the Gaelic tongue, and laughed. But the boat
3731𓀴never turned aside, and flew on, right before my eyes, for Iona.
3732𓀴
3733𓀴I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore from rock
3734𓀴to rock, crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach
3735𓀴of my voice, I still cried and waved to them; and when they were quite
3736𓀴gone, I thought my heart would have burst. All the time of my troubles
3737𓀴I wept only twice. Once, when I could not reach the yard, and now, the
3738𓀴second time, when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries. But this
3739𓀴time I wept and roared like a wicked child, tearing up the turf with
3740𓀴my nails, and grinding my face in the earth. If a wish would kill men,
3741𓀴those two fishers would never have seen morning, and I should likely
3742𓀴have died upon my island.
3743𓀴
3744𓀴When I was a little over my anger, I must eat again, but with such
3745𓀴loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control. Sure enough, I
3746𓀴should have done as well to fast, for my fishes poisoned me again. I had
3747𓀴all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had
3748𓀴a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there
3749𓀴came on me that dreadful sense of illness, which we have no name for
3750𓀴either in Scotch or English. I thought I should have died, and made my
3751𓀴peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; and as
3752𓀴soon as I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me;
3753𓀴I observed the night was falling dry; my clothes were dried a good deal;
3754𓀴truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on
3755𓀴the isle; and so I got to sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.
3756𓀴
3757𓀴The next day (which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine) I
3758𓀴found my bodily strength run very low. But the sun shone, the air was
3759𓀴sweet, and what I managed to eat of the shell-fish agreed well with me
3760𓀴and revived my courage.
3761𓀴
3762𓀴I was scarce back on my rock (where I went always the first thing after
3763𓀴I had eaten) before I observed a boat coming down the Sound, and with
3764𓀴her head, as I thought, in my direction.
3765𓀴
3766𓀴I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought these men
3767𓀴might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my
3768𓀴assistance. But another disappointment, such as yesterday’s, was more
3769𓀴than I could bear. I turned my back, accordingly, upon the sea, and
3770𓀴did not look again till I had counted many hundreds. The boat was still
3771𓀴heading for the island. The next time I counted the full thousand, as
3772𓀴slowly as I could, my heart beating so as to hurt me. And then it was
3773𓀴out of all question. She was coming straight to Earraid!
3774𓀴
3775𓀴I could no longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out,
3776𓀴from one rock to another, as far as I could go. It is a marvel I was not
3777𓀴drowned; for when I was brought to a stand at last, my legs shook under
3778𓀴me, and my mouth was so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I
3779𓀴was able to shout.
3780𓀴
3781𓀴All this time the boat was coming on; and now I was able to perceive
3782𓀴it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday. This I knew by
3783𓀴their hair, which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black.
3784𓀴But now there was a third man along with them, who looked to be of a
3785𓀴better class.
3786𓀴
3787𓀴As soon as they were come within easy speech, they let down their sail
3788𓀴and lay quiet. In spite of my supplications, they drew no nearer in, and
3789𓀴what frightened me most of all, the new man tee-hee’d with laughter as
3790𓀴he talked and looked at me.
3791𓀴
3792𓀴Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while, speaking
3793𓀴fast and with many wavings of his hand. I told him I had no Gaelic; and
3794𓀴at this he became very angry, and I began to suspect he thought he was
3795𓀴talking English. Listening very close, I caught the word “whateffer”
3796𓀴 several times; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and
3797𓀴Hebrew for me.
3798𓀴
3799𓀴“Whatever,” said I, to show him I had caught a word.
3800𓀴
3801𓀴“Yes, yes--yes, yes,” says he, and then he looked at the other men, as
3802𓀴much as to say, “I told you I spoke English,” and began again as hard as
3803𓀴ever in the Gaelic.
3804𓀴
3805𓀴This time I picked out another word, “tide.” Then I had a flash of hope.
3806𓀴I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the
3807𓀴Ross.
3808𓀴
3809𓀴“Do you mean when the tide is out--?” I cried, and could not finish.
3810𓀴
3811𓀴“Yes, yes,” said he. “Tide.”
3812𓀴
3813𓀴At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had once more
3814𓀴begun to tee-hee with laughter), leaped back the way I had come, from
3815𓀴one stone to another, and set off running across the isle as I had never
3816𓀴run before. In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the
3817𓀴creek; and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a little trickle of water,
3818𓀴through which I dashed, not above my knees, and landed with a shout on
3819𓀴the main island.
3820𓀴
3821𓀴A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only
3822𓀴what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can
3823𓀴be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod,
3824𓀴or at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in
3825𓀴before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get
3826𓀴my shellfish--even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of
3827𓀴raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free. It
3828𓀴was no wonder the fishers had not understood me. The wonder was rather
3829𓀴that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion, and taken the trouble to
3830𓀴come back. I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close
3831𓀴upon one hundred hours. But for the fishers, I might have left my bones
3832𓀴there, in pure folly. And even as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear,
3833𓀴not only in past sufferings, but in my present case; being clothed like
3834𓀴a beggar-man, scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.
3835𓀴
3836𓀴I have seen wicked men and fools, a great many of both; and I believe
3837𓀴they both get paid in the end; but the fools first.

3842𓀴CHAPTER XV
3843𓀴
3844𓀴THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL
3845𓀴
3846𓀴
3847𓀴The Ross of Mull, which I had now got upon, was rugged and trackless,
3848𓀴like the isle I had just left; being all bog, and brier, and big stone.
3849𓀴There may be roads for them that know that country well; but for my part
3850𓀴I had no better guide than my own nose, and no other landmark than Ben
3851𓀴More.
3852𓀴
3853𓀴I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the
3854𓀴island; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way
3855𓀴came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or
3856𓀴six at night. It was low and longish, roofed with turf and built of
3857𓀴unmortared stones; and on a mound in front of it, an old gentleman sat
3858𓀴smoking his pipe in the sun.
3859𓀴
3860𓀴With what little English he had, he gave me to understand that my
3861𓀴shipmates had got safe ashore, and had broken bread in that very house
3862𓀴on the day after.
3863𓀴
3864𓀴“Was there one,” I asked, “dressed like a gentleman?”
3865𓀴
3866𓀴He said they all wore rough great-coats; but to be sure, the first of
3867𓀴them, the one that came alone, wore breeches and stockings, while the
3868𓀴rest had sailors’ trousers.
3869𓀴
3870𓀴“Ah,” said I, “and he would have a feathered hat?”
3871𓀴
3872𓀴He told me, no, that he was bareheaded like myself.
3873𓀴
3874𓀴At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat; and then the rain came
3875𓀴in my mind, and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm’s way
3876𓀴under his great-coat. This set me smiling, partly because my friend was
3877𓀴safe, partly to think of his vanity in dress.
3878𓀴
3879𓀴And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow, and cried out
3880𓀴that I must be the lad with the silver button.
3881𓀴
3882𓀴“Why, yes!” said I, in some wonder.
3883𓀴
3884𓀴“Well, then,” said the old gentleman, “I have a word for you, that you
3885𓀴are to follow your friend to his country, by Torosay.”
3886𓀴
3887𓀴He then asked me how I had fared, and I told him my tale. A
3888𓀴south-country man would certainly have laughed; but this old gentleman
3889𓀴(I call him so because of his manners, for his clothes were dropping off
3890𓀴his back) heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity. When I
3891𓀴had done, he took me by the hand, led me into his hut (it was no better)
3892𓀴and presented me before his wife, as if she had been the Queen and I a
3893𓀴duke.
3894𓀴
3895𓀴The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse, patting my
3896𓀴shoulder and smiling to me all the time, for she had no English; and the
3897𓀴old gentleman (not to be behind) brewed me a strong punch out of their
3898𓀴country spirit. All the while I was eating, and after that when I was
3899𓀴drinking the punch, I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune;
3900𓀴and the house, though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of
3901𓀴holes as a colander, seemed like a palace.
3902𓀴
3903𓀴The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber; the good people
3904𓀴let me lie; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road,
3905𓀴my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and
3906𓀴good news. The old gentleman, although I pressed him hard, would take no
3907𓀴money, and gave me an old bonnet for my head; though I am free to own I
3908𓀴was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this
3909𓀴gift of his in a wayside fountain.
3910𓀴
3911𓀴Thought I to myself: “If these are the wild Highlanders, I could wish my
3912𓀴own folk wilder.”
3913𓀴
3914𓀴I not only started late, but I must have wandered nearly half the time.
3915𓀴True, I met plenty of people, grubbing in little miserable fields that
3916𓀴would not keep a cat, or herding little kine about the bigness of asses.
3917𓀴The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion, and the
3918𓀴people condemned to the Lowland habit, which they much disliked, it was
3919𓀴strange to see the variety of their array. Some went bare, only for a
3920𓀴hanging cloak or great-coat, and carried their trousers on their backs
3921𓀴like a useless burthen: some had made an imitation of the tartan with
3922𓀴little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife’s quilt;
3923𓀴others, again, still wore the Highland philabeg, but by putting a few
3924𓀴stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like
3925𓀴a Dutchman’s. All those makeshifts were condemned and punished, for the
3926𓀴law was harshly applied, in hopes to break up the clan spirit; but in
3927𓀴that out-of-the-way, sea-bound isle, there were few to make remarks and
3928𓀴fewer to tell tales.
3929𓀴
3930𓀴They seemed in great poverty; which was no doubt natural, now that
3931𓀴rapine was put down, and the chiefs kept no longer an open house;
3932𓀴and the roads (even such a wandering, country by-track as the one
3933𓀴I followed) were infested with beggars. And here again I marked
3934𓀴a difference from my own part of the country. For our Lowland
3935𓀴beggars--even the gownsmen themselves, who beg by patent--had a louting,
3936𓀴flattering way with them, and if you gave them a plaek and asked change,
3937𓀴would very civilly return you a boddle. But these Highland beggars stood
3938𓀴on their dignity, asked alms only to buy snuff (by their account) and
3939𓀴would give no change.
3940𓀴
3941𓀴To be sure, this was no concern of mine, except in so far as it
3942𓀴entertained me by the way. What was much more to the purpose, few had
3943𓀴any English, and these few (unless they were of the brotherhood of
3944𓀴beggars) not very anxious to place it at my service. I knew Torosay
3945𓀴to be my destination, and repeated the name to them and pointed; but
3946𓀴instead of simply pointing in reply, they would give me a screed of the
3947𓀴Gaelic that set me foolish; so it was small wonder if I went out of my
3948𓀴road as often as I stayed in it.
3949𓀴
3950𓀴At last, about eight at night, and already very weary, I came to a lone
3951𓀴house, where I asked admittance, and was refused, until I bethought
3952𓀴me of the power of money in so poor a country, and held up one of my
3953𓀴guineas in my finger and thumb. Thereupon, the man of the house, who had
3954𓀴hitherto pretended to have no English, and driven me from his door by
3955𓀴signals, suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful, and agreed
3956𓀴for five shillings to give me a night’s lodging and guide me the next
3957𓀴day to Torosay.
3958𓀴
3959𓀴I slept uneasily that night, fearing I should be robbed; but I might
3960𓀴have spared myself the pain; for my host was no robber, only miserably
3961𓀴poor and a great cheat. He was not alone in his poverty; for the next
3962𓀴morning, we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a
3963𓀴rich man to have one of my guineas changed. This was perhaps a rich man
3964𓀴for Mull; he would have scarce been thought so in the south; for it
3965𓀴took all he had--the whole house was turned upside down, and a neighbour
3966𓀴brought under contribution, before he could scrape together twenty
3967𓀴shillings in silver. The odd shilling he kept for himself, protesting he
3968𓀴could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying “locked up.” For
3969𓀴all that he was very courteous and well spoken, made us both sit down
3970𓀴with his family to dinner, and brewed punch in a fine china bowl, over
3971𓀴which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start.
3972𓀴
3973𓀴I was for getting angry, and appealed to the rich man (Hector Maclean
3974𓀴was his name), who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment
3975𓀴of the five shillings. But Maclean had taken his share of the punch,
3976𓀴and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was
3977𓀴brewed; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts
3978𓀴and Gaelic songs, till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or
3979𓀴the barn for their night’s rest.
3980𓀴
3981𓀴Next day (the fourth of my travels) we were up before five upon the
3982𓀴clock; but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once, and it was three
3983𓀴hours before I had him clear of the house, and then (as you shall hear)
3984𓀴only for a worse disappointment.
3985𓀴
3986𓀴As long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean’s
3987𓀴house, all went well; only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder,
3988𓀴and when I asked him the cause, only grinned at me. No sooner, however,
3989𓀴had we crossed the back of a hill, and got out of sight of the house
3990𓀴windows, than he told me Torosay lay right in front, and that a hill-top
3991𓀴(which he pointed out) was my best landmark.
3992𓀴
3993𓀴“I care very little for that,” said I, “since you are going with me.”
3994𓀴
3995𓀴The impudent cheat answered me in the Gaelic that he had no English.
3996𓀴
3997𓀴“My fine fellow,” I said, “I know very well your English comes and goes.
3998𓀴Tell me what will bring it back? Is it more money you wish?”
3999𓀴
4000𓀴“Five shillings mair,” said he, “and hersel’ will bring ye there.”
4001𓀴
4002𓀴I reflected awhile and then offered him two, which he accepted greedily,
4003𓀴and insisted on having in his hands at once “for luck,” as he said, but
4004𓀴I think it was rather for my misfortune.
4005𓀴
4006𓀴The two shillings carried him not quite as many miles; at the end of
4007𓀴which distance, he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues
4008𓀴from his feet, like a man about to rest.
4009𓀴
4010𓀴I was now red-hot. “Ha!” said I, “have you no more English?”
4011𓀴
4012𓀴He said impudently, “No.”
4013𓀴
4014𓀴At that I boiled over, and lifted my hand to strike him; and he, drawing
4015𓀴a knife from his rags, squatted back and grinned at me like a wildcat.
4016𓀴At that, forgetting everything but my anger, I ran in upon him, put
4017𓀴aside his knife with my left, and struck him in the mouth with the
4018𓀴right. I was a strong lad and very angry, and he but a little man; and
4019𓀴he went down before me heavily. By good luck, his knife flew out of his
4020𓀴hand as he fell.
4021𓀴
4022𓀴I picked up both that and his brogues, wished him a good morning, and
4023𓀴set off upon my way, leaving him barefoot and disarmed. I chuckled to
4024𓀴myself as I went, being sure I was done with that rogue, for a variety
4025𓀴of reasons. First, he knew he could have no more of my money; next, the
4026𓀴brogues were worth in that country only a few pence; and, lastly, the
4027𓀴knife, which was really a dagger, it was against the law for him to
4028𓀴carry.
4029𓀴
4030𓀴In about half an hour of walk, I overtook a great, ragged man, moving
4031𓀴pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff. He was quite blind, and
4032𓀴told me he was a catechist, which should have put me at my ease. But
4033𓀴his face went against me; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret; and
4034𓀴presently, as we began to go on alongside, I saw the steel butt of a
4035𓀴pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket. To carry such a
4036𓀴thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence, and
4037𓀴transportation to the colonies upon a second. Nor could I quite see why
4038𓀴a religious teacher should go armed, or what a blind man could be doing
4039𓀴with a pistol.
4040𓀴
4041𓀴I told him about my guide, for I was proud of what I had done, and my
4042𓀴vanity for once got the heels of my prudence. At the mention of the
4043𓀴five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say
4044𓀴nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.
4045𓀴
4046𓀴“Was it too much?” I asked, a little faltering.
4047𓀴
4048𓀴“Too much!” cries he. “Why, I will guide you to Torosay myself for a
4049𓀴dram of brandy. And give you the great pleasure of my company (me that
4050𓀴is a man of some learning) in the bargain.”
4051𓀴
4052𓀴I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide; but at that he
4053𓀴laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.
4054𓀴
4055𓀴“In the Isle of Mull, at least,” says he, “where I know every stone and
4056𓀴heather-bush by mark of head. See, now,” he said, striking right and
4057𓀴left, as if to make sure, “down there a burn is running; and at the head
4058𓀴of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the
4059𓀴top of that; and it’s hard at the foot of the hill, that the way runs by
4060𓀴to Torosay; and the way here, being for droves, is plainly trodden, and
4061𓀴will show grassy through the heather.”
4062𓀴
4063𓀴I had to own he was right in every feature, and told my wonder.
4064𓀴
4065𓀴“Ha!” says he, “that’s nothing. Would ye believe me now, that before
4066𓀴the Act came out, and when there were weepons in this country, I could
4067𓀴shoot? Ay, could I!” cries he, and then with a leer: “If ye had such a
4068𓀴thing as a pistol here to try with, I would show ye how it’s done.”
4069𓀴
4070𓀴I told him I had nothing of the sort, and gave him a wider berth. If
4071𓀴he had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his
4072𓀴pocket, and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt. But
4073𓀴by the better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and
4074𓀴lied on in the dark.
4075𓀴
4076𓀴He then began to question me cunningly, where I came from, whether I
4077𓀴was rich, whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him (which
4078𓀴he declared he had that moment in his sporran), and all the time he kept
4079𓀴edging up to me and I avoiding him. We were now upon a sort of green
4080𓀴cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay, and we kept
4081𓀴changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel. I had so plainly the
4082𓀴upper-hand that my spirits rose, and indeed I took a pleasure in this
4083𓀴game of blindman’s buff; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier,
4084𓀴and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his
4085𓀴staff.
4086𓀴
4087𓀴Then I told him that, sure enough, I had a pistol in my pocket as well
4088𓀴as he, and if he did not strike across the hill due south I would even
4089𓀴blow his brains out.
4090𓀴
4091𓀴He became at once very polite, and after trying to soften me for some
4092𓀴time, but quite in vain, he cursed me once more in Gaelic and took
4093𓀴himself off. I watched him striding along, through bog and brier,
4094𓀴tapping with his stick, until he turned the end of a hill and
4095𓀴disappeared in the next hollow. Then I struck on again for Torosay, much
4096𓀴better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning.
4097𓀴This was an unlucky day; and these two, of whom I had just rid myself,
4098𓀴one after the other, were the two worst men I met with in the Highlands.
4099𓀴
4100𓀴At Torosay, on the Sound of Mull and looking over to the mainland
4101𓀴of Morven, there was an inn with an innkeeper, who was a Maclean, it
4102𓀴appeared, of a very high family; for to keep an inn is thought even more
4103𓀴genteel in the Highlands than it is with us, perhaps as partaking of
4104𓀴hospitality, or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken. He spoke
4105𓀴good English, and finding me to be something of a scholar, tried me
4106𓀴first in French, where he easily beat me, and then in the Latin, in
4107𓀴which I don’t know which of us did best. This pleasant rivalry put us at
4108𓀴once upon friendly terms; and I sat up and drank punch with him (or to
4109𓀴be more correct, sat up and watched him drink it), until he was so tipsy
4110𓀴that he wept upon my shoulder.
4111𓀴
4112𓀴I tried him, as if by accident, with a sight of Alan’s button; but it
4113𓀴was plain he had never seen or heard of it. Indeed, he bore some grudge
4114𓀴against the family and friends of Ardshiel, and before he was drunk
4115𓀴he read me a lampoon, in very good Latin, but with a very ill meaning,
4116𓀴which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house.
4117𓀴
4118𓀴When I told him of my catechist, he shook his head, and said I was lucky
4119𓀴to have got clear off. “That is a very dangerous man,” he said; “Duncan
4120𓀴Mackiegh is his name; he can shoot by the ear at several yards, and has
4121𓀴been often accused of highway robberies, and once of murder.”
4122𓀴
4123𓀴“The cream of it is,” says I, “that he called himself a catechist.”
4124𓀴
4125𓀴“And why should he not?” says he, “when that is what he is. It was
4126𓀴Maclean of Duart gave it to him because he was blind. But perhaps it was
4127𓀴a peety,” says my host, “for he is always on the road, going from
4128𓀴one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion; and,
4129𓀴doubtless, that is a great temptation to the poor man.”
4130𓀴
4131𓀴At last, when my landlord could drink no more, he showed me to a bed,
4132𓀴and I lay down in very good spirits; having travelled the greater part
4133𓀴of that big and crooked Island of Mull, from Earraid to Torosay, fifty
4134𓀴miles as the crow flies, and (with my wanderings) much nearer a hundred,
4135𓀴in four days and with little fatigue. Indeed I was by far in better
4136𓀴heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been
4137𓀴at the beginning.
4138𓀴
4139𓀴

4141𓀴
4142𓀴CHAPTER XVI
4143𓀴
4144𓀴THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: ACROSS MORVEN
4145𓀴
4146𓀴
4147𓀴There is a regular ferry from Torosay to Kinlochaline on the mainland.
4148𓀴Both shores of the Sound are in the country of the strong clan of the
4149𓀴Macleans, and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all
4150𓀴of that clan. The skipper of the boat, on the other hand, was called
4151𓀴Neil Roy Macrob; and since Macrob was one of the names of Alan’s
4152𓀴clansmen, and Alan himself had sent me to that ferry, I was eager to
4153𓀴come to private speech of Neil Roy.
4154𓀴
4155𓀴In the crowded boat this was of course impossible, and the passage was
4156𓀴a very slow affair. There was no wind, and as the boat was wretchedly
4157𓀴equipped, we could pull but two oars on one side, and one on the other.
4158𓀴The men gave way, however, with a good will, the passengers taking
4159𓀴spells to help them, and the whole company giving the time in
4160𓀴Gaelic boat-songs. And what with the songs, and the sea-air, and the
4161𓀴good-nature and spirit of all concerned, and the bright weather, the
4162𓀴passage was a pretty thing to have seen.
4163𓀴
4164𓀴But there was one melancholy part. In the mouth of Loch Aline we found
4165𓀴a great sea-going ship at anchor; and this I supposed at first to be one
4166𓀴of the King’s cruisers which were kept along that coast, both summer
4167𓀴and winter, to prevent communication with the French. As we got a little
4168𓀴nearer, it became plain she was a ship of merchandise; and what still
4169𓀴more puzzled me, not only her decks, but the sea-beach also, were quite
4170𓀴black with people, and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between
4171𓀴them. Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound
4172𓀴of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and
4173𓀴lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.
4174𓀴
4175𓀴Then I understood this was an emigrant ship bound for the American
4176𓀴colonies.
4177𓀴
4178𓀴We put the ferry-boat alongside, and the exiles leaned over the
4179𓀴bulwarks, weeping and reaching out their hands to my fellow-passengers,
4180𓀴among whom they counted some near friends. How long this might have gone
4181𓀴on I do not know, for they seemed to have no sense of time: but at last
4182𓀴the captain of the ship, who seemed near beside himself (and no great
4183𓀴wonder) in the midst of this crying and confusion, came to the side and
4184𓀴begged us to depart.
4185𓀴
4186𓀴Thereupon Neil sheered off; and the chief singer in our boat struck into
4187𓀴a melancholy air, which was presently taken up both by the emigrants and
4188𓀴their friends upon the beach, so that it sounded from all sides like a
4189𓀴lament for the dying. I saw the tears run down the cheeks of the men and
4190𓀴women in the boat, even as they bent at the oars; and the circumstances
4191𓀴and the music of the song (which is one called “Lochaber no more”) were
4192𓀴highly affecting even to myself.
4193𓀴
4194𓀴At Kinlochaline I got Neil Roy upon one side on the beach, and said I
4195𓀴made sure he was one of Appin’s men.
4196𓀴
4197𓀴“And what for no?” said he.
4198𓀴
4199𓀴“I am seeking somebody,” said I; “and it comes in my mind that you will
4200𓀴have news of him. Alan Breck Stewart is his name.” And very foolishly,
4201𓀴instead of showing him the button, I sought to pass a shilling in his
4202𓀴hand.
4203𓀴
4204𓀴At this he drew back. “I am very much affronted,” he said; “and this is
4205𓀴not the way that one shentleman should behave to another at all. The man
4206𓀴you ask for is in France; but if he was in my sporran,” says he, “and
4207𓀴your belly full of shillings, I would not hurt a hair upon his body.”
4208𓀴
4209𓀴I saw I had gone the wrong way to work, and without wasting time upon
4210𓀴apologies, showed him the button lying in the hollow of my palm.
4211𓀴
4212𓀴“Aweel, aweel,” said Neil; “and I think ye might have begun with that
4213𓀴end of the stick, whatever! But if ye are the lad with the silver
4214𓀴button, all is well, and I have the word to see that ye come safe. But
4215𓀴if ye will pardon me to speak plainly,” says he, “there is a name that
4216𓀴you should never take into your mouth, and that is the name of Alan
4217𓀴Breck; and there is a thing that ye would never do, and that is to offer
4218𓀴your dirty money to a Hieland shentleman.”
4219𓀴
4220𓀴It was not very easy to apologise; for I could scarce tell him (what was
4221𓀴the truth) that I had never dreamed he would set up to be a gentleman
4222𓀴until he told me so. Neil on his part had no wish to prolong his
4223𓀴dealings with me, only to fulfil his orders and be done with it; and
4224𓀴he made haste to give me my route. This was to lie the night in
4225𓀴Kinlochaline in the public inn; to cross Morven the next day to Ardgour,
4226𓀴and lie the night in the house of one John of the Claymore, who was
4227𓀴warned that I might come; the third day, to be set across one loch at
4228𓀴Corran and another at Balachulish, and then ask my way to the house of
4229𓀴James of the Glens, at Aucharn in Duror of Appin. There was a good deal
4230𓀴of ferrying, as you hear; the sea in all this part running deep into the
4231𓀴mountains and winding about their roots. It makes the country strong to
4232𓀴hold and difficult to travel, but full of prodigious wild and dreadful
4233𓀴prospects.
4234𓀴
4235𓀴I had some other advice from Neil: to speak with no one by the way, to
4236𓀴avoid Whigs, Campbells, and the “red-soldiers;” to leave the road and
4237𓀴lie in a bush if I saw any of the latter coming, “for it was never
4238𓀴chancy to meet in with them;” and in brief, to conduct myself like a
4239𓀴robber or a Jacobite agent, as perhaps Neil thought me.
4240𓀴
4241𓀴The inn at Kinlochaline was the most beggarly vile place that ever pigs
4242𓀴were styed in, full of smoke, vermin, and silent Highlanders. I was not
4243𓀴only discontented with my lodging, but with myself for my mismanagement
4244𓀴of Neil, and thought I could hardly be worse off. But very wrongly, as I
4245𓀴was soon to see; for I had not been half an hour at the inn (standing in
4246𓀴the door most of the time, to ease my eyes from the peat smoke) when a
4247𓀴thunderstorm came close by, the springs broke in a little hill on which
4248𓀴the inn stood, and one end of the house became a running water. Places
4249𓀴of public entertainment were bad enough all over Scotland in those days;
4250𓀴yet it was a wonder to myself, when I had to go from the fireside to the
4251𓀴bed in which I slept, wading over the shoes.
4252𓀴
4253𓀴Early in my next day’s journey I overtook a little, stout, solemn man,
4254𓀴walking very slowly with his toes turned out, sometimes reading in
4255𓀴a book and sometimes marking the place with his finger, and dressed
4256𓀴decently and plainly in something of a clerical style.
4257𓀴
4258𓀴This I found to be another catechist, but of a different order from the
4259𓀴blind man of Mull: being indeed one of those sent out by the Edinburgh
4260𓀴Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, to evangelise the more
4261𓀴savage places of the Highlands. His name was Henderland; he spoke with
4262𓀴the broad south-country tongue, which I was beginning to weary for the
4263𓀴sound of; and besides common countryship, we soon found we had a
4264𓀴more particular bond of interest. For my good friend, the minister of
4265𓀴Essendean, had translated into the Gaelic in his by-time a number of
4266𓀴hymns and pious books which Henderland used in his work, and held in
4267𓀴great esteem. Indeed, it was one of these he was carrying and reading
4268𓀴when we met.
4269𓀴
4270𓀴We fell in company at once, our ways lying together as far as to
4271𓀴Kingairloch. As we went, he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers
4272𓀴and workers that we met or passed; and though of course I could not tell
4273𓀴what they discoursed about, yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well
4274𓀴liked in the countryside, for I observed many of them to bring out their
4275𓀴mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him.
4276𓀴
4277𓀴I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise; as far, that is,
4278𓀴as they were none of Alan’s; and gave Balachulish as the place I was
4279𓀴travelling to, to meet a friend; for I thought Aucharn, or even Duror,
4280𓀴would be too particular, and might put him on the scent.
4281𓀴
4282𓀴On his part, he told me much of his work and the people he worked among,
4283𓀴the hiding priests and Jacobites, the Disarming Act, the dress, and many
4284𓀴other curiosities of the time and place. He seemed moderate; blaming
4285𓀴Parliament in several points, and especially because they had framed the
4286𓀴Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those
4287𓀴who carried weapons.
4288𓀴
4289𓀴This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the
4290𓀴Appin tenants; questions which, I thought, would seem natural enough in
4291𓀴the mouth of one travelling to that country.
4292𓀴
4293𓀴
4294𓀴
4295𓀴He said it was a bad business. “It’s wonderful,” said he, “where the
4296𓀴tenants find the money, for their life is mere starvation. (Ye don’t
4297𓀴carry such a thing as snuff, do ye, Mr. Balfour? No. Well, I’m better
4298𓀴wanting it.) But these tenants (as I was saying) are doubtless partly
4299𓀴driven to it. James Stewart in Duror (that’s him they call James of the
4300𓀴Glens) is half-brother to Ardshiel, the captain of the clan; and he is
4301𓀴a man much looked up to, and drives very hard. And then there’s one they
4302𓀴call Alan Breck--”
4303𓀴
4304𓀴“Ah!” I cried, “what of him?”
4305𓀴
4306𓀴“What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth?” said Henderland. “He’s
4307𓀴here and awa; here to-day and gone to-morrow: a fair heather-cat. He
4308𓀴might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush, and I wouldnae
4309𓀴wonder! Ye’ll no carry such a thing as snuff, will ye?”
4310𓀴
4311𓀴I told him no, and that he had asked the same thing more than once.
4312𓀴
4313𓀴“It’s highly possible,” said he, sighing. “But it seems strange ye
4314𓀴shouldnae carry it. However, as I was saying, this Alan Breck is a bold,
4315𓀴desperate customer, and well kent to be James’s right hand. His life
4316𓀴is forfeit already; he would boggle at naething; and maybe, if a
4317𓀴tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame.”
4318𓀴
4319𓀴“You make a poor story of it all, Mr. Henderland,” said I. “If it is all
4320𓀴fear upon both sides, I care to hear no more of it.”
4321𓀴
4322𓀴“Na,” said Mr. Henderland, “but there’s love too, and self-denial that
4323𓀴should put the like of you and me to shame. There’s something fine about
4324𓀴it; no perhaps Christian, but humanly fine. Even Alan Breck, by all that
4325𓀴I hear, is a chield to be respected. There’s many a lying sneck-draw
4326𓀴sits close in kirk in our own part of the country, and stands well in
4327𓀴the world’s eye, and maybe is a far worse man, Mr. Balfour, than yon
4328𓀴misguided shedder of man’s blood. Ay, ay, we might take a lesson by
4329𓀴them.--Ye’ll perhaps think I’ve been too long in the Hielands?” he
4330𓀴added, smiling to me.
4331𓀴
4332𓀴I told him not at all; that I had seen much to admire among the
4333𓀴Highlanders; and if he came to that, Mr. Campbell himself was a
4334𓀴Highlander.
4335𓀴
4336𓀴“Ay,” said he, “that’s true. It’s a fine blood.”
4337𓀴
4338𓀴“And what is the King’s agent about?” I asked.
4339𓀴
4340𓀴“Colin Campbell?” says Henderland. “Putting his head in a bees’ byke!”
4341𓀴
4342𓀴“He is to turn the tenants out by force, I hear?” said I.
4343𓀴
4344𓀴“Yes,” says he, “but the business has gone back and forth, as folk say.
4345𓀴First, James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh, and got some lawyer (a
4346𓀴Stewart, nae doubt--they all hing together like bats in a steeple) and
4347𓀴had the proceedings stayed. And then Colin Campbell cam’ in again, and
4348𓀴had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer. And now they tell me
4349𓀴the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow. It’s to begin at Duror
4350𓀴under James’s very windows, which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of
4351𓀴it.”
4352𓀴
4353𓀴“Do you think they’ll fight?” I asked.
4354𓀴
4355𓀴“Well,” says Henderland, “they’re disarmed--or supposed to be--for
4356𓀴there’s still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places. And
4357𓀴then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming. But for all that, if I was
4358𓀴his lady wife, I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again.
4359𓀴They’re queer customers, the Appin Stewarts.”
4360𓀴
4361𓀴I asked if they were worse than their neighbours.
4362𓀴
4363𓀴“No they,” said he. “And that’s the worst part of it. For if Colin Roy
4364𓀴can get his business done in Appin, he has it all to begin again in the
4365𓀴next country, which they call Mamore, and which is one of the countries
4366𓀴of the Camerons. He’s King’s Factor upon both, and from both he has to
4367𓀴drive out the tenants; and indeed, Mr. Balfour (to be open with ye),
4368𓀴it’s my belief that if he escapes the one lot, he’ll get his death by
4369𓀴the other.”
4370𓀴
4371𓀴So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day; until
4372𓀴at last, Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company, and
4373𓀴satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell’s (“whom,” says
4374𓀴he, “I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted
4375𓀴Zion”), proposed that I should make a short stage, and lie the night in
4376𓀴his house a little beyond Kingairloch. To say truth, I was overjoyed;
4377𓀴for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore, and since my double
4378𓀴misadventure, first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper,
4379𓀴I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger. Accordingly we shook
4380𓀴hands upon the bargain, and came in the afternoon to a small house,
4381𓀴standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch. The sun was already gone
4382𓀴from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side, but shone on
4383𓀴those of Appin on the farther; the loch lay as still as a lake, only
4384𓀴the gulls were crying round the sides of it; and the whole place seemed
4385𓀴solemn and uncouth.
4386𓀴
4387𓀴We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland’s dwelling, than to
4388𓀴my great surprise (for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders)
4389𓀴he burst rudely past me, dashed into the room, caught up a jar and
4390𓀴a small horn-spoon, and began ladling snuff into his nose in most
4391𓀴excessive quantities. Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing, and looked
4392𓀴round upon me with a rather silly smile.
4393𓀴
4394𓀴“It’s a vow I took,” says he. “I took a vow upon me that I wouldnae
4395𓀴carry it. Doubtless it’s a great privation; but when I think upon
4396𓀴the martyrs, not only to the Scottish Covenant but to other points of
4397𓀴Christianity, I think shame to mind it.”
4398𓀴
4399𓀴As soon as we had eaten (and porridge and whey was the best of the good
4400𓀴man’s diet) he took a grave face and said he had a duty to perform by
4401𓀴Mr. Campbell, and that was to inquire into my state of mind towards God.
4402𓀴I was inclined to smile at him since the business of the snuff; but he
4403𓀴had not spoken long before he brought the tears into my eyes. There are
4404𓀴two things that men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we get
4405𓀴none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people; but
4406𓀴Mr. Henderland had their very speech upon his tongue. And though I was a
4407𓀴good deal puffed up with my adventures and with having come off, as the
4408𓀴saying is, with flying colours; yet he soon had me on my knees beside a
4409𓀴simple, poor old man, and both proud and glad to be there.
4410𓀴
4411𓀴Before we went to bed he offered me sixpence to help me on my way, out
4412𓀴of a scanty store he kept in the turf wall of his house; at which excess
4413𓀴of goodness I knew not what to do. But at last he was so earnest with me
4414𓀴that I thought it the more mannerly part to let him have his way, and so
4415𓀴left him poorer than myself.
4416𓀴

4420𓀴CHAPTER XVII
4421𓀴
4422𓀴THE DEATH OF THE RED FOX
4423𓀴
4424𓀴
4425𓀴The next day Mr. Henderland found for me a man who had a boat of his own
4426𓀴and was to cross the Linnhe Loch that afternoon into Appin, fishing. Him
4427𓀴he prevailed on to take me, for he was one of his flock; and in this way
4428𓀴I saved a long day’s travel and the price of the two public ferries I
4429𓀴must otherwise have passed.
4430𓀴
4431𓀴It was near noon before we set out; a dark day with clouds, and the sun
4432𓀴shining upon little patches. The sea was here very deep and still,
4433𓀴and had scarce a wave upon it; so that I must put the water to my lips
4434𓀴before I could believe it to be truly salt. The mountains on either side
4435𓀴were high, rough and barren, very black and gloomy in the shadow of
4436𓀴the clouds, but all silver-laced with little watercourses where the sun
4437𓀴shone upon them. It seemed a hard country, this of Appin, for people to
4438𓀴care as much about as Alan did.
4439𓀴
4440𓀴There was but one thing to mention. A little after we had started,
4441𓀴the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the
4442𓀴water-side to the north. It was much of the same red as soldiers’ coats;
4443𓀴every now and then, too, there came little sparks and lightnings, as
4444𓀴though the sun had struck upon bright steel.
4445𓀴
4446𓀴I asked my boatman what it should be, and he answered he supposed it was
4447𓀴some of the red soldiers coming from Fort William into Appin, against
4448𓀴the poor tenantry of the country. Well, it was a sad sight to me;
4449𓀴and whether it was because of my thoughts of Alan, or from something
4450𓀴prophetic in my bosom, although this was but the second time I had seen
4451𓀴King George’s troops, I had no good will to them.
4452𓀴
4453𓀴At last we came so near the point of land at the entering in of Loch
4454𓀴Leven that I begged to be set on shore. My boatman (who was an honest
4455𓀴fellow and mindful of his promise to the catechist) would fain have
4456𓀴carried me on to Balachulish; but as this was to take me farther from my
4457𓀴secret destination, I insisted, and was set on shore at last under the
4458𓀴wood of Lettermore (or Lettervore, for I have heard it both ways) in
4459𓀴Alan’s country of Appin.
4460𓀴
4461𓀴This was a wood of birches, growing on a steep, craggy side of a
4462𓀴mountain that overhung the loch. It had many openings and ferny howes;
4463𓀴and a road or bridle track ran north and south through the midst of
4464𓀴it, by the edge of which, where was a spring, I sat down to eat some
4465𓀴oat-bread of Mr. Henderland’s and think upon my situation.
4466𓀴
4467𓀴Here I was not only troubled by a cloud of stinging midges, but far more
4468𓀴by the doubts of my mind. What I ought to do, why I was going to join
4469𓀴myself with an outlaw and a would-be murderer like Alan, whether I
4470𓀴should not be acting more like a man of sense to tramp back to the south
4471𓀴country direct, by my own guidance and at my own charges, and what Mr.
4472𓀴Campbell or even Mr. Henderland would think of me if they should ever
4473𓀴learn my folly and presumption: these were the doubts that now began to
4474𓀴come in on me stronger than ever.
4475𓀴
4476𓀴As I was so sitting and thinking, a sound of men and horses came to me
4477𓀴through the wood; and presently after, at a turning of the road, I saw
4478𓀴four travellers come into view. The way was in this part so rough and
4479𓀴narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins. The
4480𓀴first was a great, red-headed gentleman, of an imperious and flushed
4481𓀴face, who carried his hat in his hand and fanned himself, for he was in
4482𓀴a breathing heat. The second, by his decent black garb and white wig,
4483𓀴I correctly took to be a lawyer. The third was a servant, and wore some
4484𓀴part of his clothes in tartan, which showed that his master was of a
4485𓀴Highland family, and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour
4486𓀴with the Government, since the wearing of tartan was against the Act. If
4487𓀴I had been better versed in these things, I would have known the tartan
4488𓀴to be of the Argyle (or Campbell) colours. This servant had a good-sized
4489𓀴portmanteau strapped on his horse, and a net of lemons (to brew punch
4490𓀴with) hanging at the saddle-bow; as was often enough the custom with
4491𓀴luxurious travellers in that part of the country.
4492𓀴
4493𓀴As for the fourth, who brought up the tail, I had seen his like before,
4494𓀴and knew him at once to be a sheriff’s officer.
4495𓀴
4496𓀴I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind (for no
4497𓀴reason that I can tell) to go through with my adventure; and when the
4498𓀴first came alongside of me, I rose up from the bracken and asked him the
4499𓀴way to Aucharn.
4500𓀴
4501𓀴He stopped and looked at me, as I thought, a little oddly; and then,
4502𓀴turning to the lawyer, “Mungo,” said he, “there’s many a man would think
4503𓀴this more of a warning than two pyats. Here am I on my road to Duror on
4504𓀴the job ye ken; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken,
4505𓀴and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn.”
4506𓀴
4507𓀴“Glenure,” said the other, “this is an ill subject for jesting.”
4508𓀴
4509𓀴These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me, while the two
4510𓀴followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear.
4511𓀴
4512𓀴“And what seek ye in Aucharn?” said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure, him
4513𓀴they called the Red Fox; for he it was that I had stopped.
4514𓀴
4515𓀴“The man that lives there,” said I.
4516𓀴
4517𓀴“James of the Glens,” says Glenure, musingly; and then to the lawyer:
4518𓀴“Is he gathering his people, think ye?”
4519𓀴
4520𓀴“Anyway,” says the lawyer, “we shall do better to bide where we are, and
4521𓀴let the soldiers rally us.”
4522𓀴
4523𓀴“If you are concerned for me,” said I, “I am neither of his people nor
4524𓀴yours, but an honest subject of King George, owing no man and fearing no
4525𓀴man.”
4526𓀴
4527𓀴“Why, very well said,” replies the Factor. “But if I may make so bold as
4528𓀴ask, what does this honest man so far from his country? and why does
4529𓀴he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel? I have power here, I must tell
4530𓀴you. I am King’s Factor upon several of these estates, and have twelve
4531𓀴files of soldiers at my back.”
4532𓀴
4533𓀴“I have heard a waif word in the country,” said I, a little nettled,
4534𓀴“that you were a hard man to drive.”
4535𓀴
4536𓀴He still kept looking at me, as if in doubt.
4537𓀴
4538𓀴“Well,” said he, at last, “your tongue is bold; but I am no unfriend to
4539𓀴plainness. If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on
4540𓀴any other day but this, I would have set ye right and bidden ye God
4541𓀴speed. But to-day--eh, Mungo?” And he turned again to look at the
4542𓀴lawyer.
4543𓀴
4544𓀴But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up
4545𓀴the hill; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road.
4546𓀴
4547𓀴“O, I am dead!” he cried, several times over.
4548𓀴
4549𓀴The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms, the servant
4550𓀴standing over and clasping his hands. And now the wounded man looked
4551𓀴from one to another with scared eyes, and there was a change in his
4552𓀴voice, that went to the heart.
4553𓀴
4554𓀴“Take care of yourselves,” says he. “I am dead.”
4555𓀴
4556𓀴He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound, but his
4557𓀴fingers slipped on the buttons. With that he gave a great sigh, his head
4558𓀴rolled on his shoulder, and he passed away.
4559𓀴
4560𓀴The lawyer said never a word, but his face was as sharp as a pen and
4561𓀴as white as the dead man’s; the servant broke out into a great noise of
4562𓀴crying and weeping, like a child; and I, on my side, stood staring at
4563𓀴them in a kind of horror. The sheriff’s officer had run back at the
4564𓀴first sound of the shot, to hasten the coming of the soldiers.
4565𓀴
4566𓀴At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road,
4567𓀴and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger.
4568𓀴
4569𓀴I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses; for he had
4570𓀴no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill, crying out, “The
4571𓀴murderer! the murderer!”
4572𓀴
4573𓀴So little a time had elapsed, that when I got to the top of the first
4574𓀴steepness, and could see some part of the open mountain, the murderer
4575𓀴was still moving away at no great distance. He was a big man, in a black
4576𓀴coat, with metal buttons, and carried a long fowling-piece.
4577𓀴
4578𓀴“Here!” I cried. “I see him!”
4579𓀴
4580𓀴At that the murderer gave a little, quick look over his shoulder, and
4581𓀴began to run. The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches; then
4582𓀴he came out again on the upper side, where I could see him climbing like
4583𓀴a jackanapes, for that part was again very steep; and then he dipped
4584𓀴behind a shoulder, and I saw him no more.
4585𓀴
4586𓀴All this time I had been running on my side, and had got a good way up,
4587𓀴when a voice cried upon me to stand.
4588𓀴
4589𓀴I was at the edge of the upper wood, and so now, when I halted and
4590𓀴looked back, I saw all the open part of the hill below me.
4591𓀴
4592𓀴The lawyer and the sheriff’s officer were standing just above the road,
4593𓀴crying and waving on me to come back; and on their left, the red-coats,
4594𓀴musket in hand, were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood.
4595𓀴
4596𓀴“Why should I come back?” I cried. “Come you on!”
4597𓀴
4598𓀴“Ten pounds if ye take that lad!” cried the lawyer. “He’s an accomplice.
4599𓀴He was posted here to hold us in talk.”
4600𓀴
4601𓀴At that word (which I could hear quite plainly, though it was to the
4602𓀴soldiers and not to me that he was crying it) my heart came in my mouth
4603𓀴with quite a new kind of terror. Indeed, it is one thing to stand the
4604𓀴danger of your life, and quite another to run the peril of both life and
4605𓀴character. The thing, besides, had come so suddenly, like thunder out of
4606𓀴a clear sky, that I was all amazed and helpless.
4607𓀴
4608𓀴The soldiers began to spread, some of them to run, and others to put up
4609𓀴their pieces and cover me; and still I stood.
4610𓀴
4611𓀴“Jouk[18] in here among the trees,” said a voice close by.
4612𓀴
4613𓀴     [18] Duck.
4614𓀴
4615𓀴Indeed, I scarce knew what I was doing, but I obeyed; and as I did so, I
4616𓀴heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches.
4617𓀴
4618𓀴Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing, with
4619𓀴a fishing-rod. He gave me no salutation; indeed it was no time for
4620𓀴civilities; only “Come!” says he, and set off running along the side of
4621𓀴the mountain towards Balachulish; and I, like a sheep, to follow him.
4622𓀴
4623𓀴Now we ran among the birches; now stooping behind low humps upon the
4624𓀴mountain-side; now crawling on all fours among the heather. The pace was
4625𓀴deadly: my heart seemed bursting against my ribs; and I had neither time
4626𓀴to think nor breath to speak with. Only I remember seeing with wonder,
4627𓀴that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height
4628𓀴and look back; and every time he did so, there came a great far-away
4629𓀴cheering and crying of the soldiers.
4630𓀴
4631𓀴Quarter of an hour later, Alan stopped, clapped down flat in the
4632𓀴heather, and turned to me.
4633𓀴
4634𓀴“Now,” said he, “it’s earnest. Do as I do, for your life.”
4635𓀴
4636𓀴And at the same speed, but now with infinitely more precaution, we
4637𓀴traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had
4638𓀴come, only perhaps higher; till at last Alan threw himself down in the
4639𓀴upper wood of Lettermore, where I had found him at the first, and lay,
4640𓀴with his face in the bracken, panting like a dog.
4641𓀴
4642𓀴My own sides so ached, my head so swam, my tongue so hung out of my
4643𓀴mouth with heat and dryness, that I lay beside him like one dead.
4644𓀴
4645𓀴
4646𓀴
4647𓀴
4648𓀴CHAPTER XVIII
4649𓀴
4650𓀴I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE
4651𓀴
4652𓀴
4653𓀴Alan was the first to come round. He rose, went to the border of the
4654𓀴wood, peered out a little, and then returned and sat down.
4655𓀴
4656𓀴“Well,” said he, “yon was a hot burst, David.”
4657𓀴
4658𓀴I said nothing, nor so much as lifted my face. I had seen murder done,
4659𓀴and a great, ruddy, jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment; the
4660𓀴pity of that sight was still sore within me, and yet that was but a part
4661𓀴of my concern. Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated; here was
4662𓀴Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops; and whether his
4663𓀴was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered, signified
4664𓀴but little. By my way of it, my only friend in that wild country was
4665𓀴blood-guilty in the first degree; I held him in horror; I could not look
4666𓀴upon his face; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold
4667𓀴isle, than in that warm wood beside a murderer.
4668𓀴
4669𓀴“Are ye still wearied?” he asked again.
4670𓀴
4671𓀴“No,” said I, still with my face in the bracken; “no, I am not wearied
4672𓀴now, and I can speak. You and me must twine,”[19] I said. “I liked you very
4673𓀴well, Alan, but your ways are not mine, and they’re not God’s: and the
4674𓀴short and the long of it is just that we must twine.”
4675𓀴
4676𓀴     [19] Part.
4677𓀴
4678𓀴“I will hardly twine from ye, David, without some kind of reason for
4679𓀴the same,” said Alan, mighty gravely. “If ye ken anything against
4680𓀴my reputation, it’s the least thing that ye should do, for old
4681𓀴acquaintance’ sake, to let me hear the name of it; and if ye have only
4682𓀴taken a distaste to my society, it will be proper for me to judge if I’m
4683𓀴insulted.”
4684𓀴
4685𓀴“Alan,” said I, “what is the sense of this? Ye ken very well yon
4686𓀴Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road.”
4687𓀴
4688𓀴He was silent for a little; then says he, “Did ever ye hear tell of the
4689𓀴story of the Man and the Good People?”--by which he meant the fairies.
4690𓀴
4691𓀴“No,” said I, “nor do I want to hear it.”
4692𓀴
4693𓀴“With your permission, Mr. Balfour, I will tell it you, whatever,” says
4694𓀴Alan. “The man, ye should ken, was cast upon a rock in the sea, where
4695𓀴it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went
4696𓀴through to Ireland. The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore, and
4697𓀴it’s not far from where we suffered ship-wreck. Well, it seems the man
4698𓀴cried so sore, if he could just see his little bairn before he died!
4699𓀴that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him, and sent
4700𓀴one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke[20] and laid it down
4701𓀴beside the man where he lay sleeping. So when the man woke, there was a
4702𓀴poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved. Well, it
4703𓀴seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things; and
4704𓀴for greater security, he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he
4705𓀴opened it, and there was his bairn dead. I am thinking to myself, Mr.
4706𓀴Balfour, that you and the man are very much alike.”
4707𓀴
4708𓀴     [20] Bag.
4709𓀴
4710𓀴“Do you mean you had no hand in it?” cried I, sitting up.
4711𓀴
4712𓀴“I will tell you first of all, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, as one friend to
4713𓀴another,” said Alan, “that if I were going to kill a gentleman, it would
4714𓀴not be in my own country, to bring trouble on my clan; and I would not
4715𓀴go wanting sword and gun, and with a long fishing-rod upon my back.”
4716𓀴
4717𓀴“Well,” said I, “that’s true!”
4718𓀴
4719𓀴“And now,” continued Alan, taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon
4720𓀴it in a certain manner, “I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art
4721𓀴nor part, act nor thought in it.”
4722𓀴
4723𓀴“I thank God for that!” cried I, and offered him my hand.
4724𓀴
4725𓀴He did not appear to see it.
4726𓀴
4727𓀴“And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell!” said he. “They are
4728𓀴not so scarce, that I ken!”
4729𓀴
4730𓀴“At least,” said I, “you cannot justly blame me, for you know very
4731𓀴well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are
4732𓀴different, I thank God again for that. We may all be tempted; but
4733𓀴to take a life in cold blood, Alan!” And I could say no more for the
4734𓀴moment. “And do you know who did it?” I added. “Do you know that man in
4735𓀴the black coat?”
4736𓀴
4737𓀴“I have nae clear mind about his coat,” said Alan cunningly, “but it
4738𓀴sticks in my head that it was blue.”
4739𓀴
4740𓀴“Blue or black, did ye know him?” said I.
4741𓀴
4742𓀴“I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him,” says Alan. “He gaed very
4743𓀴close by me, to be sure, but it’s a strange thing that I should just
4744𓀴have been tying my brogues.”
4745𓀴
4746𓀴“Can you swear that you don’t know him, Alan?” I cried, half angered,
4747𓀴half in a mind to laugh at his evasions.
4748𓀴
4749𓀴“Not yet,” says he; “but I’ve a grand memory for forgetting, David.”
4750𓀴
4751𓀴“And yet there was one thing I saw clearly,” said I; “and that was, that
4752𓀴you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers.”
4753𓀴
4754𓀴“It’s very likely,” said Alan; “and so would any gentleman. You and me
4755𓀴were innocent of that transaction.”
4756𓀴
4757𓀴“The better reason, since we were falsely suspected, that we should get
4758𓀴clear,” I cried. “The innocent should surely come before the guilty.”
4759𓀴
4760𓀴“Why, David,” said he, “the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled
4761𓀴in court; but for the lad that shot the bullet, I think the best place
4762𓀴for him will be the heather. Them that havenae dipped their hands in any
4763𓀴little difficulty, should be very mindful of the case of them that have.
4764𓀴And that is the good Christianity. For if it was the other way round
4765𓀴about, and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our
4766𓀴shoes, and we in his (as might very well have been), I think we would be
4767𓀴a good deal obliged to him oursel’s if he would draw the soldiers.”
4768𓀴
4769𓀴When it came to this, I gave Alan up. But he looked so innocent all the
4770𓀴time, and was in such clear good faith in what he said, and so ready to
4771𓀴sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty, that my mouth was closed.
4772𓀴Mr. Henderland’s words came back to me: that we ourselves might take a
4773𓀴lesson by these wild Highlanders. Well, here I had taken mine. Alan’s
4774𓀴morals were all tail-first; but he was ready to give his life for them,
4775𓀴such as they were.
4776𓀴
4777𓀴“Alan,” said I, “I’ll not say it’s the good Christianity as I understand
4778𓀴it, but it’s good enough. And here I offer ye my hand for the second
4779𓀴time.”
4780𓀴
4781𓀴Whereupon he gave me both of his, saying surely I had cast a spell upon
4782𓀴him, for he could forgive me anything. Then he grew very grave, and said
4783𓀴we had not much time to throw away, but must both flee that country: he,
4784𓀴because he was a deserter, and the whole of Appin would now be searched
4785𓀴like a chamber, and every one obliged to give a good account of himself;
4786𓀴and I, because I was certainly involved in the murder.
4787𓀴
4788𓀴“O!” says I, willing to give him a little lesson, “I have no fear of the
4789𓀴justice of my country.”
4790𓀴
4791𓀴“As if this was your country!” said he. “Or as if ye would be tried
4792𓀴here, in a country of Stewarts!”
4793𓀴
4794𓀴“It’s all Scotland,” said I.
4795𓀴
4796𓀴“Man, I whiles wonder at ye,” said Alan. “This is a Campbell that’s been
4797𓀴killed. Well, it’ll be tried in Inverara, the Campbells’ head place;
4798𓀴with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all
4799𓀴(and that’s the Duke) sitting cocking on the bench. Justice, David?
4800𓀴The same justice, by all the world, as Glenure found awhile ago at the
4801𓀴roadside.”
4802𓀴
4803𓀴This frightened me a little, I confess, and would have frightened me
4804𓀴more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan’s predictions; indeed
4805𓀴it was but in one point that he exaggerated, there being but eleven
4806𓀴Campbells on the jury; though as the other four were equally in the
4807𓀴Duke’s dependence, it mattered less than might appear. Still, I cried
4808𓀴out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle, who (for all he was a
4809𓀴Whig) was yet a wise and honest nobleman.
4810𓀴
4811𓀴“Hoot!” said Alan, “the man’s a Whig, nae doubt; but I would never deny
4812𓀴he was a good chieftain to his clan. And what would the clan think if
4813𓀴there was a Campbell shot, and naebody hanged, and their own chief
4814𓀴the Justice General? But I have often observed,” says Alan, “that you
4815𓀴Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what’s right and wrong.”
4816𓀴
4817𓀴At this I did at last laugh out aloud, when to my surprise, Alan joined
4818𓀴in, and laughed as merrily as myself.
4819𓀴
4820𓀴“Na, na,” said he, “we’re in the Hielands, David; and when I tell ye
4821𓀴to run, take my word and run. Nae doubt it’s a hard thing to skulk and
4822𓀴starve in the Heather, but it’s harder yet to lie shackled in a red-coat
4823𓀴prison.”
4824𓀴
4825𓀴I asked him whither we should flee; and as he told me “to the Lowlands,”
4826𓀴 I was a little better inclined to go with him; for, indeed, I was
4827𓀴growing impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle.
4828𓀴Besides, Alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the
4829𓀴matter, that I began to be afraid he might be right. Of all deaths, I
4830𓀴would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that
4831𓀴uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I
4832𓀴had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar’s ballad) and took away
4833𓀴my appetite for courts of justice.
4834𓀴
4835𓀴“I’ll chance it, Alan,” said I. “I’ll go with you.”
4836𓀴
4837𓀴“But mind you,” said Alan, “it’s no small thing. Ye maun lie bare and
4838𓀴hard, and brook many an empty belly. Your bed shall be the moorcock’s,
4839𓀴and your life shall be like the hunted deer’s, and ye shall sleep with
4840𓀴your hand upon your weapons. Ay, man, ye shall taigle many a weary foot,
4841𓀴or we get clear! I tell ye this at the start, for it’s a life that I ken
4842𓀴well. But if ye ask what other chance ye have, I answer: Nane. Either
4843𓀴take to the heather with me, or else hang.”
4844𓀴
4845𓀴“And that’s a choice very easily made,” said I; and we shook hands upon
4846𓀴it.
4847𓀴
4848𓀴“And now let’s take another keek at the red-coats,” says Alan, and he
4849𓀴led me to the north-eastern fringe of the wood.
4850𓀴
4851𓀴Looking out between the trees, we could see a great side of mountain,
4852𓀴running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch. It was a rough
4853𓀴part, all hanging stone, and heather, and big scrogs of birchwood; and
4854𓀴away at the far end towards Balachulish, little wee red soldiers were
4855𓀴dipping up and down over hill and howe, and growing smaller every
4856𓀴minute. There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses
4857𓀴for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and
4858𓀴doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.
4859𓀴
4860𓀴Alan watched them, smiling to himself.
4861𓀴
4862𓀴“Ay,” said he, “they’ll be gey weary before they’ve got to the end of
4863𓀴that employ! And so you and me, David, can sit down and eat a bite, and
4864𓀴breathe a bit longer, and take a dram from my bottle. Then we’ll strike
4865𓀴for Aucharn, the house of my kinsman, James of the Glens, where I must
4866𓀴get my clothes, and my arms, and money to carry us along; and then,
4867𓀴David, we’ll cry, ‘Forth, Fortune!’ and take a cast among the heather.”
4868𓀴
4869𓀴So we sat again and ate and drank, in a place whence we could see the
4870𓀴sun going down into a field of great, wild, and houseless mountains,
4871𓀴such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion. Partly as
4872𓀴we so sat, and partly afterwards, on the way to Aucharn, each of us
4873𓀴narrated his adventures; and I shall here set down so much of Alan’s as
4874𓀴seems either curious or needful.
4875𓀴
4876𓀴It appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed; saw
4877𓀴me, and lost me, and saw me again, as I tumbled in the roost; and at
4878𓀴last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard. It was this that put
4879𓀴him in some hope I would maybe get to land after all, and made him leave
4880𓀴those clues and messages which had brought me (for my sins) to that
4881𓀴unlucky country of Appin.
4882𓀴
4883𓀴In the meanwhile, those still on the brig had got the skiff launched,
4884𓀴and one or two were on board of her already, when there came a second
4885𓀴wave greater than the first, and heaved the brig out of her place, and
4886𓀴would certainly have sent her to the bottom, had she not struck and
4887𓀴caught on some projection of the reef. When she had struck first, it had
4888𓀴been bows-on, so that the stern had hitherto been lowest. But now her
4889𓀴stern was thrown in the air, and the bows plunged under the sea; and
4890𓀴with that, the water began to pour into the fore-scuttle like the
4891𓀴pouring of a mill-dam.
4892𓀴
4893𓀴It took the colour out of Alan’s face, even to tell what followed.
4894𓀴For there were still two men lying impotent in their bunks; and these,
4895𓀴seeing the water pour in and thinking the ship had foundered, began to
4896𓀴cry out aloud, and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on
4897𓀴deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars.
4898𓀴They were not two hundred yards away, when there came a third great sea;
4899𓀴and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef; her canvas filled for
4900𓀴a moment, and she seemed to sail in chase of them, but settling all the
4901𓀴while; and presently she drew down and down, as if a hand was drawing
4902𓀴her; and the sea closed over the _Covenant_ of Dysart.
4903𓀴
4904𓀴Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore, being stunned with the
4905𓀴horror of that screaming; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach
4906𓀴when Hoseason woke up, as if out of a muse, and bade them lay hands upon
4907𓀴Alan. They hung back indeed, having little taste for the employment;
4908𓀴but Hoseason was like a fiend, crying that Alan was alone, that he had
4909𓀴a great sum about him, that he had been the means of losing the brig and
4910𓀴drowning all their comrades, and that here was both revenge and wealth
4911𓀴upon a single cast. It was seven against one; in that part of the shore
4912𓀴there was no rock that Alan could set his back to; and the sailors began
4913𓀴to spread out and come behind him.
4914𓀴
4915𓀴“And then,” said Alan, “the little man with the red head--I havenae mind
4916𓀴of the name that he is called.”
4917𓀴
4918𓀴“Riach,” said I.
4919𓀴
4920𓀴“Ay” said Alan, “Riach! Well, it was him that took up the clubs for me,
4921𓀴asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment, and, says he ‘Dod,
4922𓀴I’ll put my back to the Hielandman’s mysel’.’ That’s none such an
4923𓀴entirely bad little man, yon little man with the red head,” said Alan.
4924𓀴“He has some spunks of decency.”
4925𓀴
4926𓀴“Well,” said I, “he was kind to me in his way.”
4927𓀴
4928𓀴“And so he was to Alan,” said he; “and by my troth, I found his way a
4929𓀴very good one! But ye see, David, the loss of the ship and the cries of
4930𓀴these poor lads sat very ill upon the man; and I’m thinking that would
4931𓀴be the cause of it.”
4932𓀴
4933𓀴“Well, I would think so,” says I; “for he was as keen as any of the rest
4934𓀴at the beginning. But how did Hoseason take it?”
4935𓀴
4936𓀴“It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill,” says Alan. “But
4937𓀴the little man cried to me to run, and indeed I thought it was a good
4938𓀴observe, and ran. The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the
4939𓀴beach, like folk that were not agreeing very well together.”
4940𓀴
4941𓀴“What do you mean by that?” said I.
4942𓀴
4943𓀴“Well, the fists were going,” said Alan; “and I saw one man go down like
4944𓀴a pair of breeks. But I thought it would be better no to wait. Ye see
4945𓀴there’s a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull, which is no good
4946𓀴company for a gentleman like me. If it hadnae been for that I would have
4947𓀴waited and looked for ye mysel’, let alone giving a hand to the little
4948𓀴man.” (It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach’s stature, for, to say
4949𓀴the truth, the one was not much smaller than the other.) “So,” says he,
4950𓀴continuing, “I set my best foot forward, and whenever I met in with any
4951𓀴one I cried out there was a wreck ashore. Man, they didnae stop to fash
4952𓀴with me! Ye should have seen them linking for the beach! And when they
4953𓀴got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run, which is aye
4954𓀴good for a Campbell. I’m thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the
4955𓀴brig went down in the lump and didnae break. But it was a very unlucky
4956𓀴thing for you, that same; for if any wreck had come ashore they would
4957𓀴have hunted high and low, and would soon have found ye.”

4962𓀴CHAPTER XIX
4963𓀴
4964𓀴THE HOUSE OF FEAR
4965𓀴
4966𓀴
4967𓀴Night fell as we were walking, and the clouds, which had broken up in
4968𓀴the afternoon, settled in and thickened, so that it fell, for the
4969𓀴season of the year, extremely dark. The way we went was over rough
4970𓀴mountainsides; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner, I could
4971𓀴by no means see how he directed himself.
4972𓀴
4973𓀴At last, about half-past ten of the clock, we came to the top of a brae,
4974𓀴and saw lights below us. It seemed a house door stood open and let out a
4975𓀴beam of fire and candle-light; and all round the house and steading
4976𓀴five or six persons were moving hurriedly about, each carrying a lighted
4977𓀴brand.
4978𓀴
4979𓀴“James must have tint his wits,” said Alan. “If this was the soldiers
4980𓀴instead of you and me, he would be in a bonny mess. But I dare say he’ll
4981𓀴have a sentry on the road, and he would ken well enough no soldiers
4982𓀴would find the way that we came.”
4983𓀴
4984𓀴Hereupon he whistled three times, in a particular manner. It was strange
4985𓀴to see how, at the first sound of it, all the moving torches came to
4986𓀴a stand, as if the bearers were affrighted; and how, at the third, the
4987𓀴bustle began again as before.
4988𓀴
4989𓀴Having thus set folks’ minds at rest, we came down the brae, and were
4990𓀴met at the yard gate (for this place was like a well-doing farm) by
4991𓀴a tall, handsome man of more than fifty, who cried out to Alan in the
4992𓀴Gaelic.
4993𓀴
4994𓀴“James Stewart,” said Alan, “I will ask ye to speak in Scotch, for here
4995𓀴is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other. This is him,”
4996𓀴 he added, putting his arm through mine, “a young gentleman of the
4997𓀴Lowlands, and a laird in his country too, but I am thinking it will be
4998𓀴the better for his health if we give his name the go-by.”
4999𓀴
5000𓀴James of the Glens turned to me for a moment, and greeted me courteously
5001𓀴enough; the next he had turned to Alan.
5002𓀴
5003𓀴“This has been a dreadful accident,” he cried. “It will bring trouble on
5004𓀴the country.” And he wrung his hands.
5005𓀴
5006𓀴“Hoots!” said Alan, “ye must take the sour with the sweet, man. Colin
5007𓀴Roy is dead, and be thankful for that!”
5008𓀴
5009𓀴“Ay” said James, “and by my troth, I wish he was alive again! It’s all
5010𓀴very fine to blow and boast beforehand; but now it’s done, Alan; and
5011𓀴who’s to bear the wyte[21] of it? The accident fell out in Appin--mind ye
5012𓀴that, Alan; it’s Appin that must pay; and I am a man that has a family.”
5013𓀴
5014𓀴     [21] Blame.
5015𓀴
5016𓀴While this was going on I looked about me at the servants. Some were on
5017𓀴ladders, digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings,
5018𓀴from which they brought out guns, swords, and different weapons of
5019𓀴war; others carried them away; and by the sound of mattock blows from
5020𓀴somewhere farther down the brae, I suppose they buried them. Though they
5021𓀴were all so busy, there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts; men
5022𓀴struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their
5023𓀴burning torches; and James was continually turning about from his talk
5024𓀴with Alan, to cry out orders which were apparently never understood. The
5025𓀴faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry
5026𓀴and panic; and though none spoke above his breath, their speech sounded
5027𓀴both anxious and angry.
5028𓀴
5029𓀴It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying
5030𓀴a pack or bundle; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan’s
5031𓀴instinct awoke at the mere sight of it.
5032𓀴
5033𓀴“What’s that the lassie has?” he asked.
5034𓀴
5035𓀴“We’re just setting the house in order, Alan,” said James, in his
5036𓀴frightened and somewhat fawning way. “They’ll search Appin with candles,
5037𓀴and we must have all things straight. We’re digging the bit guns and
5038𓀴swords into the moss, ye see; and these, I am thinking, will be your ain
5039𓀴French clothes. We’ll be to bury them, I believe.”
5040𓀴
5041𓀴“Bury my French clothes!” cried Alan. “Troth, no!” And he laid hold upon
5042𓀴the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself, recommending me
5043𓀴in the meanwhile to his kinsman.
5044𓀴
5045𓀴James carried me accordingly into the kitchen, and sat down with me at
5046𓀴table, smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner. But
5047𓀴presently the gloom returned upon him; he sat frowning and biting his
5048𓀴fingers; only remembered me from time to time; and then gave me but a
5049𓀴word or two and a poor smile, and back into his private terrors. His
5050𓀴wife sat by the fire and wept, with her face in her hands; his eldest
5051𓀴son was crouched upon the floor, running over a great mass of papers and
5052𓀴now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end; all
5053𓀴the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room,
5054𓀴in a blind hurry of fear, and whimpering as she went; and every now and
5055𓀴again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard, and cry for
5056𓀴orders.
5057𓀴
5058𓀴At last James could keep his seat no longer, and begged my permission to
5059𓀴be so unmannerly as walk about. “I am but poor company altogether, sir,”
5060𓀴 says he, “but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident, and the
5061𓀴trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons.”
5062𓀴
5063𓀴A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought
5064𓀴should have been kept; and at that his excitement burst out so that it
5065𓀴was painful to witness. He struck the lad repeatedly.
5066𓀴
5067𓀴“Are you gone gyte?”[22] he cried. “Do you wish to hang your father?” and
5068𓀴forgetful of my presence, carried on at him a long time together in the
5069𓀴Gaelic, the young man answering nothing; only the wife, at the name of
5070𓀴hanging, throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than
5071𓀴before.
5072𓀴
5073𓀴     [22] Mad.
5074𓀴
5075𓀴This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see; and
5076𓀴I was right glad when Alan returned, looking like himself in his fine
5077𓀴French clothes, though (to be sure) they were now grown almost too
5078𓀴battered and withered to deserve the name of fine. I was then taken out
5079𓀴in my turn by another of the sons, and given that change of clothing of
5080𓀴which I had stood so long in need, and a pair of Highland brogues made
5081𓀴of deer-leather, rather strange at first, but after a little practice
5082𓀴very easy to the feet.
5083𓀴
5084𓀴By the time I came back Alan must have told his story; for it seemed
5085𓀴understood that I was to fly with him, and they were all busy upon our
5086𓀴equipment. They gave us each a sword and pistols, though I professed my
5087𓀴inability to use the former; and with these, and some ammunition, a bag
5088𓀴of oatmeal, an iron pan, and a bottle of right French brandy, we were
5089𓀴ready for the heather. Money, indeed, was lacking. I had about two
5090𓀴guineas left; Alan’s belt having been despatched by another hand, that
5091𓀴trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune;
5092𓀴and as for James, it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys
5093𓀴to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants, that he could
5094𓀴only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny, the most of it in
5095𓀴coppers.
5096𓀴
5097𓀴“This’ll no do,” said Alan.
5098𓀴
5099𓀴“Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by,” said James, “and get word
5100𓀴sent to me. Ye see, ye’ll have to get this business prettily off, Alan.
5101𓀴This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two. They’re sure to get
5102𓀴wind of ye, sure to seek ye, and by my way of it, sure to lay on ye the
5103𓀴wyte of this day’s accident. If it falls on you, it falls on me that am
5104𓀴your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country. And if
5105𓀴it comes on me----” he paused, and bit his fingers, with a white face.
5106𓀴“It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang,” said he.
5107𓀴
5108𓀴“It would be an ill day for Appin,” says Alan.
5109𓀴
5110𓀴“It’s a day that sticks in my throat,” said James. “O man, man, man--man
5111𓀴Alan! you and me have spoken like two fools!” he cried, striking his
5112𓀴hand upon the wall so that the house rang again.
5113𓀴
5114𓀴“Well, and that’s true, too,” said Alan; “and my friend from the
5115𓀴Lowlands here” (nodding at me) “gave me a good word upon that head, if I
5116𓀴would only have listened to him.”
5117𓀴
5118𓀴“But see here,” said James, returning to his former manner, “if they lay
5119𓀴me by the heels, Alan, it’s then that you’ll be needing the money. For
5120𓀴with all that I have said and that you have said, it will look very
5121𓀴black against the two of us; do ye mark that? Well, follow me out, and
5122𓀴ye’ll, I’ll see that I’ll have to get a paper out against ye mysel’;
5123𓀴have to offer a reward for ye; ay, will I! It’s a sore thing to do
5124𓀴between such near friends; but if I get the dirdum[23] of this dreadful
5125𓀴accident, I’ll have to fend for myself, man. Do ye see that?”
5126𓀴
5127𓀴     [23] Blame.
5128𓀴
5129𓀴He spoke with a pleading earnestness, taking Alan by the breast of the
5130𓀴coat.
5131𓀴
5132𓀴“Ay” said Alan, “I see that.”
5133𓀴
5134𓀴“And ye’ll have to be clear of the country, Alan--ay, and clear of
5135𓀴Scotland--you and your friend from the Lowlands, too. For I’ll have to
5136𓀴paper your friend from the Lowlands. Ye see that, Alan--say that ye see
5137𓀴that!”
5138𓀴
5139𓀴I thought Alan flushed a bit. “This is unco hard on me that brought him
5140𓀴here, James,” said he, throwing his head back. “It’s like making me a
5141𓀴traitor!”
5142𓀴
5143𓀴“Now, Alan, man!” cried James. “Look things in the face! He’ll be
5144𓀴papered anyway; Mungo Campbell’ll be sure to paper him; what matters
5145𓀴if I paper him too? And then, Alan, I am a man that has a family.” And
5146𓀴then, after a little pause on both sides, “And, Alan, it’ll be a jury of
5147𓀴Campbells,” said he.
5148𓀴
5149𓀴“There’s one thing,” said Alan, musingly, “that naebody kens his name.”
5150𓀴
5151𓀴“Nor yet they shallnae, Alan! There’s my hand on that,” cried James, for
5152𓀴all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some
5153𓀴advantage. “But just the habit he was in, and what he looked like, and
5154𓀴his age, and the like? I couldnae well do less.”
5155𓀴
5156𓀴“I wonder at your father’s son,” cried Alan, sternly. “Would ye sell the
5157𓀴lad with a gift? Would ye change his clothes and then betray him?”
5158𓀴
5159𓀴“No, no, Alan,” said James. “No, no: the habit he took off--the habit
5160𓀴Mungo saw him in.” But I thought he seemed crestfallen; indeed, he was
5161𓀴clutching at every straw, and all the time, I dare say, saw the faces of
5162𓀴his hereditary foes on the bench, and in the jury-box, and the gallows
5163𓀴in the background.
5164𓀴
5165𓀴“Well, sir,” says Alan, turning to me, “what say ye to that? Ye are here
5166𓀴under the safeguard of my honour; and it’s my part to see nothing done
5167𓀴but what shall please you.”
5168𓀴
5169𓀴“I have but one word to say,” said I; “for to all this dispute I am a
5170𓀴perfect stranger. But the plain common-sense is to set the blame where
5171𓀴it belongs, and that is on the man who fired the shot. Paper him, as ye
5172𓀴call it, set the hunt on him; and let honest, innocent folk show their
5173𓀴faces in safety.” But at this both Alan and James cried out in horror;
5174𓀴bidding me hold my tongue, for that was not to be thought of; and asking
5175𓀴me what the Camerons would think? (which confirmed me, it must have been
5176𓀴a Cameron from Mamore that did the act) and if I did not see that the
5177𓀴lad might be caught? “Ye havenae surely thought of that?” said they,
5178𓀴with such innocent earnestness, that my hands dropped at my side and I
5179𓀴despaired of argument.
5180𓀴
5181𓀴“Very well, then,” said I, “paper me, if you please, paper Alan, paper
5182𓀴King George! We’re all three innocent, and that seems to be what’s
5183𓀴wanted. But at least, sir,” said I to James, recovering from my little
5184𓀴fit of annoyance, “I am Alan’s friend, and if I can be helpful to
5185𓀴friends of his, I will not stumble at the risk.”
5186𓀴
5187𓀴I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent, for I saw Alan
5188𓀴troubled; and, besides (thinks I to myself), as soon as my back is
5189𓀴turned, they will paper me, as they call it, whether I consent or not.
5190𓀴But in this I saw I was wrong; for I had no sooner said the words, than
5191𓀴Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair, came running over to us, and wept
5192𓀴first upon my neck and then on Alan’s, blessing God for our goodness to
5193𓀴her family.
5194𓀴
5195𓀴“As for you, Alan, it was no more than your bounden duty,” she said.
5196𓀴“But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst, and seen
5197𓀴the goodman fleeching like a suitor, him that by rights should give his
5198𓀴commands like any king--as for you, my lad,” she says, “my heart is wae
5199𓀴not to have your name, but I have your face; and as long as my heart
5200𓀴beats under my bosom, I will keep it, and think of it, and bless it.”
5201𓀴 And with that she kissed me, and burst once more into such sobbing, that
5202𓀴I stood abashed.
5203𓀴
5204𓀴“Hoot, hoot,” said Alan, looking mighty silly. “The day comes unco soon
5205𓀴in this month of July; and to-morrow there’ll be a fine to-do in Appin,
5206𓀴a fine riding of dragoons, and crying of ‘Cruachan!’[24] and running of
5207𓀴red-coats; and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone.”
5208𓀴
5209𓀴     [24] The rallying-word of the Campbells.
5210𓀴
5211𓀴Thereupon we said farewell, and set out again, bending somewhat
5212𓀴eastwards, in a fine mild dark night, and over much the same broken
5213𓀴country as before.

5218𓀴CHAPTER XX
5219𓀴
5220𓀴THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE ROCKS
5221𓀴
5222𓀴
5223𓀴Sometimes we walked, sometimes ran; and as it drew on to morning, walked
5224𓀴ever the less and ran the more. Though, upon its face, that country
5225𓀴appeared to be a desert, yet there were huts and houses of the people,
5226𓀴of which we must have passed more than twenty, hidden in quiet places of
5227𓀴the hills. When we came to one of these, Alan would leave me in the way,
5228𓀴and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at
5229𓀴the window with some sleeper awakened. This was to pass the news; which,
5230𓀴in that country, was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to
5231𓀴it even while fleeing for his life; and so well attended to by others,
5232𓀴that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard
5233𓀴already of the murder. In the others, as well as I could make out
5234𓀴(standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue), the news was
5235𓀴received with more of consternation than surprise.
5236𓀴
5237𓀴For all our hurry, day began to come in while we were still far from any
5238𓀴shelter. It found us in a prodigious valley, strewn with rocks and where
5239𓀴ran a foaming river. Wild mountains stood around it; there grew there
5240𓀴neither grass nor trees; and I have sometimes thought since then, that
5241𓀴it may have been the valley called Glencoe, where the massacre was in
5242𓀴the time of King William. But for the details of our itinerary, I am all
5243𓀴to seek; our way lying now by short cuts, now by great detours; our pace
5244𓀴being so hurried, our time of journeying usually by night; and the names
5245𓀴of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the
5246𓀴more easily forgotten.
5247𓀴
5248𓀴The first peep of morning, then, showed us this horrible place, and I
5249𓀴could see Alan knit his brow.
5250𓀴
5251𓀴“This is no fit place for you and me,” he said. “This is a place they’re
5252𓀴bound to watch.”
5253𓀴
5254𓀴And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side, in a part
5255𓀴where the river was split in two among three rocks. It went through with
5256𓀴a horrid thundering that made my belly quake; and there hung over the
5257𓀴lynn a little mist of spray. Alan looked neither to the right nor to the
5258𓀴left, but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands
5259𓀴and knees to check himself, for that rock was small and he might have
5260𓀴pitched over on the far side. I had scarce time to measure the distance
5261𓀴or to understand the peril before I had followed him, and he had caught
5262𓀴and stopped me.
5263𓀴
5264𓀴So there we stood, side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray,
5265𓀴a far broader leap in front of us, and the river dinning upon all sides.
5266𓀴When I saw where I was, there came on me a deadly sickness of fear,
5267𓀴and I put my hand over my eyes. Alan took me and shook me; I saw he
5268𓀴was speaking, but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind
5269𓀴prevented me from hearing; only I saw his face was red with anger, and
5270𓀴that he stamped upon the rock. The same look showed me the water raging
5271𓀴by, and the mist hanging in the air: and with that I covered my eyes
5272𓀴again and shuddered.
5273𓀴
5274𓀴The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips, and forced
5275𓀴me to drink about a gill, which sent the blood into my head again. Then,
5276𓀴putting his hands to his mouth, and his mouth to my ear, he shouted,
5277𓀴“Hang or drown!” and turning his back upon me, leaped over the farther
5278𓀴branch of the stream, and landed safe.
5279𓀴
5280𓀴I was now alone upon the rock, which gave me the more room; the brandy
5281𓀴was singing in my ears; I had this good example fresh before me, and
5282𓀴just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once, I should never
5283𓀴leap at all. I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth, with
5284𓀴that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of
5285𓀴courage. Sure enough, it was but my hands that reached the full length;
5286𓀴these slipped, caught again, slipped again; and I was sliddering back
5287𓀴into the lynn, when Alan seized me, first by the hair, then by the
5288𓀴collar, and with a great strain dragged me into safety.
5289𓀴
5290𓀴Never a word he said, but set off running again for his life, and I must
5291𓀴stagger to my feet and run after him. I had been weary before, but now
5292𓀴I was sick and bruised, and partly drunken with the brandy; I kept
5293𓀴stumbling as I ran, I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me; and
5294𓀴when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a
5295𓀴number of others, it was none too soon for David Balfour.
5296𓀴
5297𓀴A great rock I have said; but by rights it was two rocks leaning
5298𓀴together at the top, both some twenty feet high, and at the first sight
5299𓀴inaccessible. Even Alan (though you may say he had as good as four
5300𓀴hands) failed twice in an attempt to climb them; and it was only at the
5301𓀴third trial, and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with
5302𓀴such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone, that he secured
5303𓀴a lodgment. Once there, he let down his leathern girdle; and with the
5304𓀴aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock, I scrambled up
5305𓀴beside him.
5306𓀴
5307𓀴Then I saw why we had come there; for the two rocks, being both somewhat
5308𓀴hollow on the top and sloping one to the other, made a kind of dish or
5309𓀴saucer, where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden.
5310𓀴
5311𓀴All this while Alan had not said a word, and had run and climbed with
5312𓀴such a savage, silent frenzy of hurry, that I knew that he was in mortal
5313𓀴fear of some miscarriage. Even now we were on the rock he said nothing,
5314𓀴nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face; but clapped flat
5315𓀴down, and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter
5316𓀴scouted all round the compass. The dawn had come quite clear; we could
5317𓀴see the stony sides of the valley, and its bottom, which was bestrewed
5318𓀴with rocks, and the river, which went from one side to another, and made
5319𓀴white falls; but nowhere the smoke of a house, nor any living creature
5320𓀴but some eagles screaming round a cliff.
5321𓀴
5322𓀴Then at last Alan smiled.
5323𓀴
5324𓀴“Ay” said he, “now we have a chance;” and then looking at me with some
5325𓀴amusement, “Ye’re no very gleg[25] at the jumping,” said he.
5326𓀴
5327𓀴     [25] Brisk.
5328𓀴
5329𓀴At this I suppose I coloured with mortification, for he added at once,
5330𓀴“Hoots! small blame to ye! To be feared of a thing and yet to do it, is
5331𓀴what makes the prettiest kind of a man. And then there was water there,
5332𓀴and water’s a thing that dauntons even me. No, no,” said Alan, “it’s no
5333𓀴you that’s to blame, it’s me.”
5334𓀴
5335𓀴I asked him why.
5336𓀴
5337𓀴“Why,” said he, “I have proved myself a gomeral this night. For first
5338𓀴of all I take a wrong road, and that in my own country of Appin; so that
5339𓀴the day has caught us where we should never have been; and thanks to
5340𓀴that, we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort. And next (which is
5341𓀴the worst of the two, for a man that has been so much among the heather
5342𓀴as myself) I have come wanting a water-bottle, and here we lie for a
5343𓀴long summer’s day with naething but neat spirit. Ye may think that a
5344𓀴small matter; but before it comes night, David, ye’ll give me news of
5345𓀴it.”
5346𓀴
5347𓀴I was anxious to redeem my character, and offered, if he would pour out
5348𓀴the brandy, to run down and fill the bottle at the river.
5349𓀴
5350𓀴“I wouldnae waste the good spirit either,” says he. “It’s been a good
5351𓀴friend to you this night; or in my poor opinion, ye would still be
5352𓀴cocking on yon stone. And what’s mair,” says he, “ye may have observed
5353𓀴(you that’s a man of so much penetration) that Alan Breck Stewart was
5354𓀴perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar’.”
5355𓀴
5356𓀴“You!” I cried, “you were running fit to burst.”
5357𓀴
5358𓀴“Was I so?” said he. “Well, then, ye may depend upon it, there was nae
5359𓀴time to be lost. And now here is enough said; gang you to your sleep,
5360𓀴lad, and I’ll watch.”
5361𓀴
5362𓀴Accordingly, I lay down to sleep; a little peaty earth had drifted in
5363𓀴between the top of the two rocks, and some bracken grew there, to be a
5364𓀴bed to me; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles.
5365𓀴
5366𓀴I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened,
5367𓀴and found Alan’s hand pressed upon my mouth.
5368𓀴
5369𓀴“Wheesht!” he whispered. “Ye were snoring.”
5370𓀴
5371𓀴“Well,” said I, surprised at his anxious and dark face, “and why not?”
5372𓀴
5373𓀴He peered over the edge of the rock, and signed to me to do the like.
5374𓀴
5375𓀴It was now high day, cloudless, and very hot. The valley was as clear as
5376𓀴in a picture. About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats; a
5377𓀴big fire blazed in their midst, at which some were cooking; and near by,
5378𓀴on the top of a rock about as high as ours, there stood a sentry, with
5379𓀴the sun sparkling on his arms. All the way down along the river-side
5380𓀴were posted other sentries; here near together, there widelier
5381𓀴scattered; some planted like the first, on places of command, some
5382𓀴on the ground level and marching and counter-marching, so as to meet
5383𓀴half-way. Higher up the glen, where the ground was more open, the chain
5384𓀴of posts was continued by horse-soldiers, whom we could see in the
5385𓀴distance riding to and fro. Lower down, the infantry continued; but
5386𓀴as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable
5387𓀴burn, they were more widely set, and only watched the fords and
5388𓀴stepping-stones.
5389𓀴
5390𓀴I took but one look at them, and ducked again into my place. It was
5391𓀴strange indeed to see this valley, which had lain so solitary in the
5392𓀴hour of dawn, bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and
5393𓀴breeches.
5394𓀴
5395𓀴“Ye see,” said Alan, “this was what I was afraid of, Davie: that they
5396𓀴would watch the burn-side. They began to come in about two hours ago,
5397𓀴and, man! but ye’re a grand hand at the sleeping! We’re in a narrow
5398𓀴place. If they get up the sides of the hill, they could easy spy us with
5399𓀴a glass; but if they’ll only keep in the foot of the valley, we’ll do
5400𓀴yet. The posts are thinner down the water; and, come night, we’ll try
5401𓀴our hand at getting by them.”
5402𓀴
5403𓀴“And what are we to do till night?” I asked.
5404𓀴
5405𓀴“Lie here,” says he, “and birstle.”
5406𓀴
5407𓀴That one good Scotch word, “birstle,” was indeed the most of the story
5408𓀴of the day that we had now to pass. You are to remember that we lay on
5409𓀴the bare top of a rock, like scones upon a girdle; the sun beat upon us
5410𓀴cruelly; the rock grew so heated, a man could scarce endure the touch of
5411𓀴it; and the little patch of earth and fern, which kept cooler, was only
5412𓀴large enough for one at a time. We took turn about to lie on the naked
5413𓀴rock, which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred
5414𓀴on a gridiron; and it ran in my mind how strange it was, that in the
5415𓀴same climate and at only a few days’ distance, I should have suffered
5416𓀴so cruelly, first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this
5417𓀴rock.
5418𓀴
5419𓀴All the while we had no water, only raw brandy for a drink, which was
5420𓀴worse than nothing; but we kept the bottle as cool as we could, burying
5421𓀴it in the earth, and got some relief by bathing our breasts and temples.
5422𓀴
5423𓀴The soldiers kept stirring all day in the bottom of the valley, now
5424𓀴changing guard, now in patrolling parties hunting among the rocks. These
5425𓀴lay round in so great a number, that to look for men among them was like
5426𓀴looking for a needle in a bottle of hay; and being so hopeless a task,
5427𓀴it was gone about with the less care. Yet we could see the soldiers
5428𓀴pike their bayonets among the heather, which sent a cold thrill into my
5429𓀴vitals; and they would sometimes hang about our rock, so that we scarce
5430𓀴dared to breathe.
5431𓀴
5432𓀴It was in this way that I first heard the right English speech; one
5433𓀴fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon the sunny face of
5434𓀴the rock on which we lay, and plucking it off again with an oath. “I
5435𓀴tell you it’s ‘ot,” says he; and I was amazed at the clipping tones and
5436𓀴the odd sing-song in which he spoke, and no less at that strange trick
5437𓀴of dropping out the letter “h.” To be sure, I had heard Ransome; but he
5438𓀴had taken his ways from all sorts of people, and spoke so imperfectly
5439𓀴at the best, that I set down the most of it to childishness. My surprise
5440𓀴was all the greater to hear that manner of speaking in the mouth of a
5441𓀴grown man; and indeed I have never grown used to it; nor yet altogether
5442𓀴with the English grammar, as perhaps a very critical eye might here and
5443𓀴there spy out even in these memoirs.
5444𓀴
5445𓀴The tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the
5446𓀴greater as the day went on; the rock getting still the hotter and the
5447𓀴sun fiercer. There were giddiness, and sickness, and sharp pangs like
5448𓀴rheumatism, to be supported. I minded then, and have often minded since,
5449𓀴on the lines in our Scotch psalm:--
5450𓀴
5451𓀴     “The moon by night thee shall not smite,
5452𓀴     Nor yet the sun by day;”
5453𓀴
5454𓀴and indeed it was only by God’s blessing that we were neither of us
5455𓀴sun-smitten.
5456𓀴
5457𓀴At last, about two, it was beyond men’s bearing, and there was now
5458𓀴temptation to resist, as well as pain to thole. For the sun being now
5459𓀴got a little into the west, there came a patch of shade on the east side
5460𓀴of our rock, which was the side sheltered from the soldiers.
5461𓀴
5462𓀴“As well one death as another,” said Alan, and slipped over the edge and
5463𓀴dropped on the ground on the shadowy side.
5464𓀴
5465𓀴I followed him at once, and instantly fell all my length, so weak was I
5466𓀴and so giddy with that long exposure. Here, then, we lay for an hour or
5467𓀴two, aching from head to foot, as weak as water, and lying quite naked
5468𓀴to the eye of any soldier who should have strolled that way. None came,
5469𓀴however, all passing by on the other side; so that our rock continued to
5470𓀴be our shield even in this new position.
5471𓀴
5472𓀴Presently we began again to get a little strength; and as the soldiers
5473𓀴were now lying closer along the river-side, Alan proposed that we should
5474𓀴try a start. I was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world;
5475𓀴and that was to be set back upon the rock; anything else was welcome
5476𓀴to me; so we got ourselves at once in marching order, and began to slip
5477𓀴from rock to rock one after the other, now crawling flat on our bellies
5478𓀴in the shade, now making a run for it, heart in mouth.
5479𓀴
5480𓀴The soldiers, having searched this side of the valley after a fashion,
5481𓀴and being perhaps somewhat sleepy with the sultriness of the afternoon,
5482𓀴had now laid by much of their vigilance, and stood dozing at their posts
5483𓀴or only kept a look-out along the banks of the river; so that in this
5484𓀴way, keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains,
5485𓀴we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood. But the business was the
5486𓀴most wearing I had ever taken part in. A man had need of a hundred
5487𓀴eyes in every part of him, to keep concealed in that uneven country and
5488𓀴within cry of so many and scattered sentries. When we must pass an open
5489𓀴place, quickness was not all, but a swift judgment not only of the lie
5490𓀴of the whole country, but of the solidity of every stone on which we
5491𓀴must set foot; for the afternoon was now fallen so breathless that the
5492𓀴rolling of a pebble sounded abroad like a pistol shot, and would start
5493𓀴the echo calling among the hills and cliffs.
5494𓀴
5495𓀴By sundown we had made some distance, even by our slow rate of progress,
5496𓀴though to be sure the sentry on the rock was still plainly in our view.
5497𓀴But now we came on something that put all fears out of season; and that
5498𓀴was a deep rushing burn, that tore down, in that part, to join the glen
5499𓀴river. At the sight of this we cast ourselves on the ground and plunged
5500𓀴head and shoulders in the water; and I cannot tell which was the more
5501𓀴pleasant, the great shock as the cool stream went over us, or the greed
5502𓀴with which we drank of it.
5503𓀴
5504𓀴We lay there (for the banks hid us), drank again and again, bathed our
5505𓀴chests, let our wrists trail in the running water till they ached
5506𓀴with the chill; and at last, being wonderfully renewed, we got out the
5507𓀴meal-bag and made drammach in the iron pan. This, though it is but cold
5508𓀴water mingled with oatmeal, yet makes a good enough dish for a hungry
5509𓀴man; and where there are no means of making fire, or (as in our case)
5510𓀴good reason for not making one, it is the chief stand-by of those who
5511𓀴have taken to the heather.
5512𓀴
5513𓀴As soon as the shadow of the night had fallen, we set forth again, at
5514𓀴first with the same caution, but presently with more boldness, standing
5515𓀴our full height and stepping out at a good pace of walking. The way
5516𓀴was very intricate, lying up the steep sides of mountains and along the
5517𓀴brows of cliffs; clouds had come in with the sunset, and the night was
5518𓀴dark and cool; so that I walked without much fatigue, but in continual
5519𓀴fear of falling and rolling down the mountains, and with no guess at our
5520𓀴direction.
5521𓀴
5522𓀴The moon rose at last and found us still on the road; it was in its last
5523𓀴quarter, and was long beset with clouds; but after awhile shone out and
5524𓀴showed me many dark heads of mountains, and was reflected far underneath
5525𓀴us on the narrow arm of a sea-loch.
5526𓀴
5527𓀴At this sight we both paused: I struck with wonder to find myself so
5528𓀴high and walking (as it seemed to me) upon clouds; Alan to make sure of
5529𓀴his direction.
5530𓀴
5531𓀴Seemingly he was well pleased, and he must certainly have judged us
5532𓀴out of ear-shot of all our enemies; for throughout the rest of our
5533𓀴night-march he beguiled the way with whistling of many tunes, warlike,
5534𓀴merry, plaintive; reel tunes that made the foot go faster; tunes of my
5535𓀴own south country that made me fain to be home from my adventures; and
5536𓀴all these, on the great, dark, desert mountains, making company upon the
5537𓀴way.

5542𓀴CHAPTER XXI
5543𓀴
5544𓀴THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE HEUGH OF CORRYNAKIEGH
5545𓀴
5546𓀴
5547𓀴Early as day comes in the beginning of July, it was still dark when we
5548𓀴reached our destination, a cleft in the head of a great mountain, with a
5549𓀴water running through the midst, and upon the one hand a shallow cave
5550𓀴in a rock. Birches grew there in a thin, pretty wood, which a little
5551𓀴farther on was changed into a wood of pines. The burn was full of trout;
5552𓀴the wood of cushat-doves; on the open side of the mountain beyond,
5553𓀴whaups would be always whistling, and cuckoos were plentiful. From the
5554𓀴mouth of the cleft we looked down upon a part of Mamore, and on the
5555𓀴sea-loch that divides that country from Appin; and this from so great
5556𓀴a height as made it my continual wonder and pleasure to sit and behold
5557𓀴them.
5558𓀴
5559𓀴The name of the cleft was the Heugh of Corrynakiegh; and although from
5560𓀴its height and being so near upon the sea, it was often beset with
5561𓀴clouds, yet it was on the whole a pleasant place, and the five days we
5562𓀴lived in it went happily.
5563𓀴
5564𓀴We slept in the cave, making our bed of heather bushes which we cut for
5565𓀴that purpose, and covering ourselves with Alan’s great-coat. There was a
5566𓀴low concealed place, in a turning of the glen, where we were so bold as
5567𓀴to make fire: so that we could warm ourselves when the clouds set in,
5568𓀴and cook hot porridge, and grill the little trouts that we caught with
5569𓀴our hands under the stones and overhanging banks of the burn. This was
5570𓀴indeed our chief pleasure and business; and not only to save our meal
5571𓀴against worse times, but with a rivalry that much amused us, we spent
5572𓀴a great part of our days at the water-side, stripped to the waist and
5573𓀴groping about or (as they say) guddling for these fish. The largest we
5574𓀴got might have been a quarter of a pound; but they were of good flesh
5575𓀴and flavour, and when broiled upon the coals, lacked only a little salt
5576𓀴to be delicious.
5577𓀴
5578𓀴In any by-time Alan must teach me to use my sword, for my ignorance
5579𓀴had much distressed him; and I think besides, as I had sometimes
5580𓀴the upper-hand of him in the fishing, he was not sorry to turn to an
5581𓀴exercise where he had so much the upper-hand of me. He made it somewhat
5582𓀴more of a pain than need have been, for he stormed at me all through the
5583𓀴lessons in a very violent manner of scolding, and would push me so close
5584𓀴that I made sure he must run me through the body. I was often tempted
5585𓀴to turn tail, but held my ground for all that, and got some profit of
5586𓀴my lessons; if it was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance,
5587𓀴which is often all that is required. So, though I could never in the
5588𓀴least please my master, I was not altogether displeased with myself.
5589𓀴
5590𓀴In the meanwhile, you are not to suppose that we neglected our chief
5591𓀴business, which was to get away.
5592𓀴
5593𓀴“It will be many a long day,” Alan said to me on our first morning,
5594𓀴“before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must
5595𓀴get word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us.”
5596𓀴
5597𓀴“And how shall we send that word?” says I. “We are here in a desert
5598𓀴place, which yet we dare not leave; and unless ye get the fowls of the
5599𓀴air to be your messengers, I see not what we shall be able to do.”
5600𓀴
5601𓀴“Ay?” said Alan. “Ye’re a man of small contrivance, David.”
5602𓀴
5603𓀴Thereupon he fell in a muse, looking in the embers of the fire; and
5604𓀴presently, getting a piece of wood, he fashioned it in a cross, the four
5605𓀴ends of which he blackened on the coals. Then he looked at me a little
5606𓀴shyly.
5607𓀴
5608𓀴“Could ye lend me my button?” says he. “It seems a strange thing to ask
5609𓀴a gift again, but I own I am laith to cut another.”
5610𓀴
5611𓀴I gave him the button; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his
5612𓀴great-coat which he had used to bind the cross; and tying in a little
5613𓀴sprig of birch and another of fir, he looked upon his work with
5614𓀴satisfaction.
5615𓀴
5616𓀴“Now,” said he, “there is a little clachan” (what is called a hamlet
5617𓀴in the English) “not very far from Corrynakiegh, and it has the name of
5618𓀴Koalisnacoan. There there are living many friends of mine whom I could
5619𓀴trust with my life, and some that I am no just so sure of. Ye see,
5620𓀴David, there will be money set upon our heads; James himsel’ is to set
5621𓀴money on them; and as for the Campbells, they would never spare siller
5622𓀴where there was a Stewart to be hurt. If it was otherwise, I would go
5623𓀴down to Koalisnacoan whatever, and trust my life into these people’s
5624𓀴hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove.”
5625𓀴
5626𓀴“But being so?” said I.
5627𓀴
5628𓀴“Being so,” said he, “I would as lief they didnae see me. There’s bad
5629𓀴folk everywhere, and what’s far worse, weak ones. So when it comes dark
5630𓀴again, I will steal down into that clachan, and set this that I have
5631𓀴been making in the window of a good friend of mine, John Breck Maccoll,
5632𓀴a bouman[26] of Appin’s.”
5633𓀴
5634𓀴     [26] A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and
5635𓀴     shares with him the increase.
5636𓀴
5637𓀴“With all my heart,” says I; “and if he finds it, what is he to think?”
5638𓀴
5639𓀴“Well,” says Alan, “I wish he was a man of more penetration, for by my
5640𓀴troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it! But this is what I
5641𓀴have in my mind. This cross is something in the nature of the
5642𓀴crosstarrie, or fiery cross, which is the signal of gathering in our
5643𓀴clans; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise, for there
5644𓀴it is standing in his window, and no word with it. So he will say to
5645𓀴himsel’, _The clan is not to rise, but there is something_. Then he
5646𓀴will see my button, and that was Duncan Stewart’s. And then he will say
5647𓀴to himsel’, _The son of Duncan is in the heather and has need of me_.”
5648𓀴
5649𓀴“Well,” said I, “it may be. But even supposing so, there is a good deal
5650𓀴of heather between here and the Forth.”
5651𓀴
5652𓀴“And that is a very true word,” says Alan. “But then John Breck will
5653𓀴see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine; and he will say to
5654𓀴himsel’ (if he is a man of any penetration at all, which I misdoubt),
5655𓀴_Alan will be lying in a wood which is both of pines and birches_. Then
5656𓀴he will think to himsel’, _That is not so very rife hereabout;_ and
5657𓀴then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh. And if he does
5658𓀴not, David, the devil may fly away with him, for what I care; for he
5659𓀴will no be worth the salt to his porridge.”
5660𓀴
5661𓀴“Eh, man,” said I, drolling with him a little, “you’re very ingenious!
5662𓀴But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black
5663𓀴and white?”
5664𓀴
5665𓀴“And that is an excellent observe, Mr. Balfour of Shaws,” says Alan,
5666𓀴drolling with me; “and it would certainly be much simpler for me to
5667𓀴write to him, but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it. He
5668𓀴would have to go to the school for two-three years; and it’s possible we
5669𓀴might be wearied waiting on him.”
5670𓀴
5671𓀴So that night Alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the
5672𓀴bouman’s window. He was troubled when he came back; for the dogs had
5673𓀴barked and the folk run out from their houses; and he thought he had
5674𓀴heard a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come to one of the doors. On
5675𓀴all accounts we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a
5676𓀴close look-out, so that if it was John Breck that came we might be ready
5677𓀴to guide him, and if it was the red-coats we should have time to get
5678𓀴away.
5679𓀴
5680𓀴About noon a man was to be spied, straggling up the open side of the
5681𓀴mountain in the sun, and looking round him as he came, from under his
5682𓀴hand. No sooner had Alan seen him than he whistled; the man turned and
5683𓀴came a little towards us: then Alan would give another “peep!” and the
5684𓀴man would come still nearer; and so by the sound of whistling, he was
5685𓀴guided to the spot where we lay.
5686𓀴
5687𓀴He was a ragged, wild, bearded man, about forty, grossly disfigured with
5688𓀴the small pox, and looked both dull and savage. Although his English
5689𓀴was very bad and broken, yet Alan (according to his very handsome use,
5690𓀴whenever I was by) would suffer him to speak no Gaelic. Perhaps the
5691𓀴strange language made him appear more backward than he really was; but
5692𓀴I thought he had little good-will to serve us, and what he had was the
5693𓀴child of terror.
5694𓀴
5695𓀴Alan would have had him carry a message to James; but the bouman would
5696𓀴hear of no message. “She was forget it,” he said in his screaming voice;
5697𓀴and would either have a letter or wash his hands of us.
5698𓀴
5699𓀴I thought Alan would be gravelled at that, for we lacked the means of
5700𓀴writing in that desert.
5701𓀴
5702𓀴But he was a man of more resources than I knew; searched the wood until
5703𓀴he found the quill of a cushat-dove, which he shaped into a pen; made
5704𓀴himself a kind of ink with gunpowder from his horn and water from the
5705𓀴running stream; and tearing a corner from his French military commission
5706𓀴(which he carried in his pocket, like a talisman to keep him from the
5707𓀴gallows), he sat down and wrote as follows:
5708𓀴
5709𓀴
5710𓀴“DEAR KINSMAN,--Please send the money by the bearer to the place he kens
5711𓀴of.
5712𓀴
5713𓀴“Your affectionate cousin,
5714𓀴
5715𓀴“A. S.”
5716𓀴
5717𓀴
5718𓀴This he intrusted to the bouman, who promised to make what manner of
5719𓀴speed he best could, and carried it off with him down the hill.
5720𓀴
5721𓀴He was three full days gone, but about five in the evening of the third,
5722𓀴we heard a whistling in the wood, which Alan answered; and presently the
5723𓀴bouman came up the water-side, looking for us, right and left. He seemed
5724𓀴less sulky than before, and indeed he was no doubt well pleased to have
5725𓀴got to the end of such a dangerous commission.
5726𓀴
5727𓀴He gave us the news of the country; that it was alive with red-coats;
5728𓀴that arms were being found, and poor folk brought in trouble daily; and
5729𓀴that James and some of his servants were already clapped in prison at
5730𓀴Fort William, under strong suspicion of complicity. It seemed it was
5731𓀴noised on all sides that Alan Breck had fired the shot; and there was a
5732𓀴bill issued for both him and me, with one hundred pounds reward.
5733𓀴
5734𓀴This was all as bad as could be; and the little note the bouman had
5735𓀴carried us from Mrs. Stewart was of a miserable sadness. In it she
5736𓀴besought Alan not to let himself be captured, assuring him, if he fell
5737𓀴in the hands of the troops, both he and James were no better than dead
5738𓀴men. The money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow, and
5739𓀴she prayed heaven we could be doing with it. Lastly, she said, she
5740𓀴enclosed us one of the bills in which we were described.
5741𓀴
5742𓀴This we looked upon with great curiosity and not a little fear, partly
5743𓀴as a man may look in a mirror, partly as he might look into the barrel
5744𓀴of an enemy’s gun to judge if it be truly aimed. Alan was advertised as
5745𓀴“a small, pock-marked, active man of thirty-five or thereby, dressed
5746𓀴in a feathered hat, a French side-coat of blue with silver buttons,
5747𓀴and lace a great deal tarnished, a red waistcoat and breeches of black,
5748𓀴shag;” and I as “a tall strong lad of about eighteen, wearing an
5749𓀴old blue coat, very ragged, an old Highland bonnet, a long homespun
5750𓀴waistcoat, blue breeches; his legs bare, low-country shoes, wanting the
5751𓀴toes; speaks like a Lowlander, and has no beard.”
5752𓀴
5753𓀴Alan was well enough pleased to see his finery so fully remembered and
5754𓀴set down; only when he came to the word tarnish, he looked upon his lace
5755𓀴like one a little mortified. As for myself, I thought I cut a miserable
5756𓀴figure in the bill; and yet was well enough pleased too, for since I had
5757𓀴changed these rags, the description had ceased to be a danger and become
5758𓀴a source of safety.
5759𓀴
5760𓀴“Alan,” said I, “you should change your clothes.”
5761𓀴
5762𓀴“Na, troth!” said Alan, “I have nae others. A fine sight I would be, if
5763𓀴I went back to France in a bonnet!”
5764𓀴
5765𓀴This put a second reflection in my mind: that if I were to separate
5766𓀴from Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest, and
5767𓀴might go openly about my business. Nor was this all; for suppose I was
5768𓀴arrested when I was alone, there was little against me; but suppose I
5769𓀴was taken in company with the reputed murderer, my case would begin to
5770𓀴be grave. For generosity’s sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head;
5771𓀴but I thought of it none the less.
5772𓀴
5773𓀴I thought of it all the more, too, when the bouman brought out a green
5774𓀴purse with four guineas in gold, and the best part of another in small
5775𓀴change. True, it was more than I had. But then Alan, with less than
5776𓀴five guineas, had to get as far as France; I, with my less than two, not
5777𓀴beyond Queensferry; so that taking things in their proportion, Alan’s
5778𓀴society was not only a peril to my life, but a burden on my purse.
5779𓀴
5780𓀴But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion.
5781𓀴He believed he was serving, helping, and protecting me. And what could I
5782𓀴do but hold my peace, and chafe, and take my chance of it?
5783𓀴
5784𓀴“It’s little enough,” said Alan, putting the purse in his pocket, “but
5785𓀴it’ll do my business. And now, John Breck, if ye will hand me over my
5786𓀴button, this gentleman and me will be for taking the road.”
5787𓀴
5788𓀴But the bouman, after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front
5789𓀴of him in the Highland manner (though he wore otherwise the Lowland
5790𓀴habit, with sea-trousers), began to roll his eyes strangely, and at last
5791𓀴said, “Her nainsel will loss it,” meaning he thought he had lost it.
5792𓀴
5793𓀴“What!” cried Alan, “you will lose my button, that was my father’s
5794𓀴before me? Now I will tell you what is in my mind, John Breck: it is
5795𓀴in my mind this is the worst day’s work that ever ye did since ye was
5796𓀴born.”
5797𓀴
5798𓀴And as Alan spoke, he set his hands on his knees and looked at the
5799𓀴bouman with a smiling mouth, and that dancing light in his eyes that
5800𓀴meant mischief to his enemies.
5801𓀴
5802𓀴Perhaps the bouman was honest enough; perhaps he had meant to cheat and
5803𓀴then, finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place, cast back
5804𓀴to honesty as being safer; at least, and all at once, he seemed to find
5805𓀴that button and handed it to Alan.
5806𓀴
5807𓀴“Well, and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls,” said
5808𓀴Alan, and then to me, “Here is my button back again, and I thank you for
5809𓀴parting with it, which is of a piece with all your friendships to me.”
5810𓀴 Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman. “For,” says he, “ye have
5811𓀴done very well by me, and set your neck at a venture, and I will always
5812𓀴give you the name of a good man.”
5813𓀴
5814𓀴Lastly, the bouman took himself off by one way; and Alan and I (getting our
5815𓀴chattels together) struck into another to resume our flight.
5816𓀴

5819𓀴
5820𓀴CHAPTER XXII
5821𓀴
5822𓀴THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE MOOR
5823𓀴
5824𓀴
5825𓀴Some seven hours’ incessant, hard travelling brought us early in the
5826𓀴morning to the end of a range of mountains. In front of us there lay a
5827𓀴piece of low, broken, desert land, which we must now cross. The sun was
5828𓀴not long up, and shone straight in our eyes; a little, thin mist went up
5829𓀴from the face of the moorland like a smoke; so that (as Alan said) there
5830𓀴might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser.
5831𓀴
5832𓀴We sat down, therefore, in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should
5833𓀴have risen, and made ourselves a dish of drammach, and held a council of
5834𓀴war.
5835𓀴
5836𓀴“David,” said Alan, “this is the kittle bit. Shall we lie here till it
5837𓀴comes night, or shall we risk it, and stave on ahead?”
5838𓀴
5839𓀴“Well,” said I, “I am tired indeed, but I could walk as far again, if
5840𓀴that was all.”
5841𓀴
5842𓀴“Ay, but it isnae,” said Alan, “nor yet the half. This is how we stand:
5843𓀴Appin’s fair death to us. To the south it’s all Campbells, and no to be
5844𓀴thought of. To the north; well, there’s no muckle to be gained by going
5845𓀴north; neither for you, that wants to get to Queensferry, nor yet for
5846𓀴me, that wants to get to France. Well, then, we’ll can strike east.”
5847𓀴
5848𓀴“East be it!” says I, quite cheerily; but I was thinking in to myself:
5849𓀴“O, man, if you would only take one point of the compass and let me take
5850𓀴any other, it would be the best for both of us.”
5851𓀴
5852𓀴“Well, then, east, ye see, we have the muirs,” said Alan. “Once there,
5853𓀴David, it’s mere pitch-and-toss. Out on yon bald, naked, flat place,
5854𓀴where can a body turn to? Let the red-coats come over a hill, they can
5855𓀴spy you miles away; and the sorrow’s in their horses’ heels, they would
5856𓀴soon ride you down. It’s no good place, David; and I’m free to say, it’s
5857𓀴worse by daylight than by dark.”
5858𓀴
5859𓀴“Alan,” said I, “hear my way of it. Appin’s death for us; we have none
5860𓀴too much money, nor yet meal; the longer they seek, the nearer they
5861𓀴may guess where we are; it’s all a risk; and I give my word to go ahead
5862𓀴until we drop.”
5863𓀴
5864𓀴Alan was delighted. “There are whiles,” said he, “when ye are altogether
5865𓀴too canny and Whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me; but there
5866𓀴come other whiles when ye show yoursel’ a mettle spark; and it’s then,
5867𓀴David, that I love ye like a brother.”
5868𓀴
5869𓀴The mist rose and died away, and showed us that country lying as waste
5870𓀴as the sea; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it, and far
5871𓀴over to the east, a herd of deer, moving like dots. Much of it was red
5872𓀴with heather; much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty
5873𓀴pools; some had been burnt black in a heath fire; and in another place
5874𓀴there was quite a forest of dead firs, standing like skeletons. A
5875𓀴wearier-looking desert man never saw; but at least it was clear of
5876𓀴troops, which was our point.
5877𓀴
5878𓀴We went down accordingly into the waste, and began to make our toilsome
5879𓀴and devious travel towards the eastern verge. There were the tops of
5880𓀴mountains all round (you are to remember) from whence we might be spied
5881𓀴at any moment; so it behoved us to keep in the hollow parts of the moor,
5882𓀴and when these turned aside from our direction to move upon its naked
5883𓀴face with infinite care. Sometimes, for half an hour together, we must
5884𓀴crawl from one heather bush to another, as hunters do when they are hard
5885𓀴upon the deer. It was a clear day again, with a blazing sun; the water
5886𓀴in the brandy bottle was soon gone; and altogether, if I had guessed
5887𓀴what it would be to crawl half the time upon my belly and to walk much
5888𓀴of the rest stooping nearly to the knees, I should certainly have held
5889𓀴back from such a killing enterprise.
5890𓀴
5891𓀴Toiling and resting and toiling again, we wore away the morning; and
5892𓀴about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep. Alan took the
5893𓀴first watch; and it seemed to me I had scarce closed my eyes before I
5894𓀴was shaken up to take the second. We had no clock to go by; and Alan
5895𓀴stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead; so that as soon
5896𓀴as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east, I might know
5897𓀴to rouse him. But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept
5898𓀴twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my
5899𓀴joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather,
5900𓀴and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; and every now
5901𓀴and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing.
5902𓀴
5903𓀴The last time I woke I seemed to come back from farther away, and
5904𓀴thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens. I looked at the
5905𓀴sprig of heath, and at that I could have cried aloud: for I saw I had
5906𓀴betrayed my trust. My head was nearly turned with fear and shame; and at
5907𓀴what I saw, when I looked out around me on the moor, my heart was like
5908𓀴dying in my body. For sure enough, a body of horse-soldiers had come
5909𓀴down during my sleep, and were drawing near to us from the south-east,
5910𓀴spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in
5911𓀴the deep parts of the heather.
5912𓀴
5913𓀴When I waked Alan, he glanced first at the soldiers, then at the mark
5914𓀴and the position of the sun, and knitted his brows with a sudden, quick
5915𓀴look, both ugly and anxious, which was all the reproach I had of him.
5916𓀴
5917𓀴“What are we to do now?” I asked.
5918𓀴
5919𓀴“We’ll have to play at being hares,” said he. “Do ye see yon mountain?”
5920𓀴 pointing to one on the north-eastern sky.
5921𓀴
5922𓀴“Ay,” said I.
5923𓀴
5924𓀴“Well, then,” says he, “let us strike for that. Its name is Ben Alder.
5925𓀴it is a wild, desert mountain full of hills and hollows, and if we can
5926𓀴win to it before the morn, we may do yet.”
5927𓀴
5928𓀴“But, Alan,” cried I, “that will take us across the very coming of the
5929𓀴soldiers!”
5930𓀴
5931𓀴“I ken that fine,” said he; “but if we are driven back on Appin, we are
5932𓀴two dead men. So now, David man, be brisk!”
5933𓀴
5934𓀴With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an
5935𓀴incredible quickness, as though it were his natural way of going. All
5936𓀴the time, too, he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the
5937𓀴moorland where we were the best concealed. Some of these had been burned
5938𓀴or at least scathed with fire; and there rose in our faces (which were
5939𓀴close to the ground) a blinding, choking dust as fine as smoke. The
5940𓀴water was long out; and this posture of running on the hands and knees
5941𓀴brings an overmastering weakness and weariness, so that the joints ache
5942𓀴and the wrists faint under your weight.
5943𓀴
5944𓀴Now and then, indeed, where was a big bush of heather, we lay awhile,
5945𓀴and panted, and putting aside the leaves, looked back at the dragoons.
5946𓀴They had not spied us, for they held straight on; a half-troop, I think,
5947𓀴covering about two miles of ground, and beating it mighty thoroughly as
5948𓀴they went. I had awakened just in time; a little later, and we must have
5949𓀴fled in front of them, instead of escaping on one side. Even as it was,
5950𓀴the least misfortune might betray us; and now and again, when a grouse
5951𓀴rose out of the heather with a clap of wings, we lay as still as the
5952𓀴dead and were afraid to breathe.
5953𓀴
5954𓀴The aching and faintness of my body, the labouring of my heart, the
5955𓀴soreness of my hands, and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the
5956𓀴continual smoke of dust and ashes, had soon grown to be so unbearable
5957𓀴that I would gladly have given up. Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me
5958𓀴enough of a false kind of courage to continue. As for himself (and you
5959𓀴are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat) he had first
5960𓀴turned crimson, but as time went on the redness began to be mingled
5961𓀴with patches of white; his breath cried and whistled as it came; and his
5962𓀴voice, when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts,
5963𓀴sounded like nothing human. Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits,
5964𓀴nor did he at all abate in his activity, so that I was driven to marvel
5965𓀴at the man’s endurance.
5966𓀴
5967𓀴At length, in the first gloaming of the night, we heard a trumpet sound,
5968𓀴and looking back from among the heather, saw the troop beginning to
5969𓀴collect. A little after, they had built a fire and camped for the night,
5970𓀴about the middle of the waste.
5971𓀴
5972𓀴At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep.
5973𓀴
5974𓀴“There shall be no sleep the night!” said Alan. “From now on, these
5975𓀴weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland, and none
5976𓀴will get out of Appin but winged fowls. We got through in the nick
5977𓀴of time, and shall we jeopard what we’ve gained? Na, na, when the day
5978𓀴comes, it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder.”
5979𓀴
5980𓀴“Alan,” I said, “it’s not the want of will: it’s the strength that I
5981𓀴want. If I could, I would; but as sure as I’m alive I cannot.”
5982𓀴
5983𓀴“Very well, then,” said Alan. “I’ll carry ye.”
5984𓀴
5985𓀴I looked to see if he were jesting; but no, the little man was in dead
5986𓀴earnest; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me.
5987𓀴
5988𓀴“Lead away!” said I. “I’ll follow.”
5989𓀴
5990𓀴He gave me one look as much as to say, “Well done, David!” and off he
5991𓀴set again at his top speed.
5992𓀴
5993𓀴It grew cooler and even a little darker (but not much) with the coming
5994𓀴of the night. The sky was cloudless; it was still early in July, and
5995𓀴pretty far north; in the darkest part of that night, you would have
5996𓀴needed pretty good eyes to read, but for all that, I have often seen it
5997𓀴darker in a winter mid-day. Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like
5998𓀴rain; and this refreshed me for a while. When we stopped to breathe,
5999𓀴and I had time to see all about me, the clearness and sweetness of
6000𓀴the night, the shapes of the hills like things asleep, and the fire
6001𓀴dwindling away behind us, like a bright spot in the midst of the moor,
6002𓀴anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in
6003𓀴agony and eat the dust like a worm.
6004𓀴
6005𓀴By what I have read in books, I think few that have held a pen were ever
6006𓀴really wearied, or they would write of it more strongly. I had no care
6007𓀴of my life, neither past nor future, and I scarce remembered there was
6008𓀴such a lad as David Balfour. I did not think of myself, but just of each
6009𓀴fresh step which I was sure would be my last, with despair--and of Alan,
6010𓀴who was the cause of it, with hatred. Alan was in the right trade as a
6011𓀴soldier; this is the officer’s part to make men continue to do things,
6012𓀴they know not wherefore, and when, if the choice was offered, they would
6013𓀴lie down where they were and be killed. And I dare say I would have made
6014𓀴a good enough private; for in these last hours it never occurred to me
6015𓀴that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able, and die
6016𓀴obeying.
6017𓀴
6018𓀴Day began to come in, after years, I thought; and by that time we were
6019𓀴past the greatest danger, and could walk upon our feet like men, instead
6020𓀴of crawling like brutes. But, dear heart have mercy! what a pair we must
6021𓀴have made, going double like old grandfathers, stumbling like babes,
6022𓀴and as white as dead folk. Never a word passed between us; each set his
6023𓀴mouth and kept his eyes in front of him, and lifted up his foot and set
6024𓀴it down again, like people lifting weights at a country play;[27] all the
6025𓀴while, with the moorfowl crying “peep!” in the heather, and the light
6026𓀴coming slowly clearer in the east.
6027𓀴
6028𓀴     [27] Village fair.
6029𓀴
6030𓀴I say Alan did as I did. Not that ever I looked at him, for I had enough
6031𓀴ado to keep my feet; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid
6032𓀴with weariness as myself, and looked as little where we were going, or
6033𓀴we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men.
6034𓀴
6035𓀴It fell in this way. We were going down a heathery brae, Alan leading
6036𓀴and I following a pace or two behind, like a fiddler and his wife; when
6037𓀴upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle, three or four ragged men leaped
6038𓀴out, and the next moment we were lying on our backs, each with a dirk at
6039𓀴his throat.
6040𓀴
6041𓀴I don’t think I cared; the pain of this rough handling was quite
6042𓀴swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full; and I was too
6043𓀴glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk. I lay looking up in
6044𓀴the face of the man that held me; and I mind his face was black with the
6045𓀴sun, and his eyes very light, but I was not afraid of him. I heard Alan
6046𓀴and another whispering in the Gaelic; and what they said was all one to
6047𓀴me.
6048𓀴
6049𓀴Then the dirks were put up, our weapons were taken away, and we were set
6050𓀴face to face, sitting in the heather.
6051𓀴
6052𓀴“They are Cluny’s men,” said Alan. “We couldnae have fallen better.
6053𓀴We’re just to bide here with these, which are his out-sentries, till
6054𓀴they can get word to the chief of my arrival.”
6055𓀴
6056𓀴Now Cluny Macpherson, the chief of the clan Vourich, had been one of the
6057𓀴leaders of the great rebellion six years before; there was a price on
6058𓀴his life; and I had supposed him long ago in France, with the rest of
6059𓀴the heads of that desperate party. Even tired as I was, the surprise of
6060𓀴what I heard half wakened me.
6061𓀴
6062𓀴“What,” I cried, “is Cluny still here?”
6063𓀴
6064𓀴“Ay, is he so!” said Alan. “Still in his own country and kept by his own
6065𓀴clan. King George can do no more.”
6066𓀴
6067𓀴I think I would have asked farther, but Alan gave me the put-off. “I am
6068𓀴rather wearied,” he said, “and I would like fine to get a sleep.” And
6069𓀴without more words, he rolled on his face in a deep heather bush, and
6070𓀴seemed to sleep at once.
6071𓀴
6072𓀴There was no such thing possible for me. You have heard grasshoppers
6073𓀴whirring in the grass in the summer time? Well, I had no sooner closed
6074𓀴my eyes, than my body, and above all my head, belly, and wrists, seemed
6075𓀴to be filled with whirring grasshoppers; and I must open my eyes again
6076𓀴at once, and tumble and toss, and sit up and lie down; and look at the
6077𓀴sky which dazzled me, or at Cluny’s wild and dirty sentries, peering out
6078𓀴over the top of the brae and chattering to each other in the Gaelic.
6079𓀴
6080𓀴That was all the rest I had, until the messenger returned; when, as it
6081𓀴appeared that Cluny would be glad to receive us, we must get once more
6082𓀴upon our feet and set forward. Alan was in excellent good spirits, much
6083𓀴refreshed by his sleep, very hungry, and looking pleasantly forward to
6084𓀴a dram and a dish of hot collops, of which, it seems, the messenger had
6085𓀴brought him word. For my part, it made me sick to hear of eating. I had
6086𓀴been dead-heavy before, and now I felt a kind of dreadful lightness,
6087𓀴which would not suffer me to walk. I drifted like a gossamer; the ground
6088𓀴seemed to me a cloud, the hills a feather-weight, the air to have a
6089𓀴current, like a running burn, which carried me to and fro. With all
6090𓀴that, a sort of horror of despair sat on my mind, so that I could have
6091𓀴wept at my own helplessness.
6092𓀴
6093𓀴I saw Alan knitting his brows at me, and supposed it was in anger; and
6094𓀴that gave me a pang of light-headed fear, like what a child may have. I
6095𓀴remember, too, that I was smiling, and could not stop smiling, hard as
6096𓀴I tried; for I thought it was out of place at such a time. But my good
6097𓀴companion had nothing in his mind but kindness; and the next moment,
6098𓀴two of the gillies had me by the arms, and I began to be carried forward
6099𓀴with great swiftness (or so it appeared to me, although I dare say it
6100𓀴was slowly enough in truth), through a labyrinth of dreary glens and
6101𓀴hollows and into the heart of that dismal mountain of Ben Alder.
6102𓀴
6103𓀴
6104𓀴
6105𓀴
6106𓀴CHAPTER XXIII
6107𓀴
6108𓀴CLUNY’S CAGE
6109𓀴
6110𓀴
6111𓀴We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled
6112𓀴up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice.
6113𓀴
6114𓀴“It’s here,” said one of the guides, and we struck up hill.
6115𓀴
6116𓀴The trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship,
6117𓀴and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted.
6118𓀴
6119𓀴Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang
6120𓀴above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the
6121𓀴country as “Cluny’s Cage.” The trunks of several trees had been wattled
6122𓀴across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind
6123𓀴this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which
6124𓀴grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof.
6125𓀴The walls were of wattle and covered with moss. The whole house had
6126𓀴something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep,
6127𓀴hillside thicket, like a wasp’s nest in a green hawthorn.
6128𓀴
6129𓀴Within, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some
6130𓀴comfort. A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the
6131𓀴fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being
6132𓀴not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below.
6133𓀴
6134𓀴This was but one of Cluny’s hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and
6135𓀴underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the
6136𓀴reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers
6137𓀴drew near or moved away. By this manner of living, and thanks to the
6138𓀴affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety,
6139𓀴while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four
6140𓀴or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express
6141𓀴command of his master. There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect
6142𓀴that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder.
6143𓀴
6144𓀴When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a
6145𓀴gillie about some cookery. He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted
6146𓀴nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe. For all that
6147𓀴he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise
6148𓀴out of his place to welcome us.
6149𓀴
6150𓀴“Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa’, sir!” said he, “and bring in your friend
6151𓀴that as yet I dinna ken the name of.”
6152𓀴
6153𓀴“And how is yourself, Cluny?” said Alan. “I hope ye do brawly, sir. And
6154𓀴I am proud to see ye, and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws,
6155𓀴Mr. David Balfour.”
6156𓀴
6157𓀴Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer, when we
6158𓀴were alone; but with strangers, he rang the words out like a herald.
6159𓀴
6160𓀴“Step in by, the both of ye, gentlemen,” says Cluny. “I make ye welcome
6161𓀴to my house, which is a queer, rude place for certain, but one where I
6162𓀴have entertained a royal personage, Mr. Stewart--ye doubtless ken the
6163𓀴personage I have in my eye. We’ll take a dram for luck, and as soon as
6164𓀴this handless man of mine has the collops ready, we’ll dine and take a
6165𓀴hand at the cartes as gentlemen should. My life is a bit driegh,” says
6166𓀴he, pouring out the brandy; “I see little company, and sit and twirl my
6167𓀴thumbs, and mind upon a great day that is gone by, and weary for another
6168𓀴great day that we all hope will be upon the road. And so here’s a toast
6169𓀴to ye: The Restoration!”
6170𓀴
6171𓀴Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank. I am sure I wished no ill
6172𓀴to King George; and if he had been there himself in proper person, it’s
6173𓀴like he would have done as I did. No sooner had I taken out the drain
6174𓀴than I felt hugely better, and could look on and listen, still a little
6175𓀴mistily perhaps, but no longer with the same groundless horror and
6176𓀴distress of mind.
6177𓀴
6178𓀴It was certainly a strange place, and we had a strange host. In his long
6179𓀴hiding, Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits, like those
6180𓀴of an old maid. He had a particular place, where no one else must sit;
6181𓀴the Cage was arranged in a particular way, which none must disturb;
6182𓀴cookery was one of his chief fancies, and even while he was greeting us
6183𓀴in, he kept an eye to the collops.
6184𓀴
6185𓀴It appears, he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and
6186𓀴one or two of his nearest friends, under the cover of night; but for the
6187𓀴more part lived quite alone, and communicated only with his sentinels
6188𓀴and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage. The first thing in the
6189𓀴morning, one of them, who was a barber, came and shaved him, and gave
6190𓀴him the news of the country, of which he was immoderately greedy. There
6191𓀴was no end to his questions; he put them as earnestly as a child; and
6192𓀴at some of the answers, laughed out of all bounds of reason, and would
6193𓀴break out again laughing at the mere memory, hours after the barber was
6194𓀴gone.
6195𓀴
6196𓀴To be sure, there might have been a purpose in his questions; for
6197𓀴though he was thus sequestered, and like the other landed gentlemen of
6198𓀴Scotland, stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers, he
6199𓀴still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan. Disputes were brought
6200𓀴to him in his hiding-hole to be decided; and the men of his country,
6201𓀴who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session, laid
6202𓀴aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and
6203𓀴hunted outlaw. When he was angered, which was often enough, he gave
6204𓀴his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king; and his
6205𓀴gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty
6206𓀴father. With each of them, as he entered, he ceremoniously shook hands,
6207𓀴both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military
6208𓀴manner. Altogether, I had a fair chance to see some of the inner
6209𓀴workings of a Highland clan; and this with a proscribed, fugitive chief;
6210𓀴his country conquered; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of
6211𓀴him, sometimes within a mile of where he lay; and when the least of the
6212𓀴ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened, could have made a fortune
6213𓀴by betraying him.
6214𓀴
6215𓀴On that first day, as soon as the collops were ready, Cluny gave them
6216𓀴with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon (for he was well supplied with
6217𓀴luxuries) and bade us draw in to our meal.
6218𓀴
6219𓀴“They,” said he, meaning the collops, “are such as I gave his Royal
6220𓀴Highness in this very house; bating the lemon juice, for at that time we
6221𓀴were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen.[28] Indeed, there
6222𓀴were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six.”
6223𓀴
6224𓀴     [28] Condiment.
6225𓀴
6226𓀴I do not know if the collops were truly very good, but my heart rose
6227𓀴against the sight of them, and I could eat but little. All the while
6228𓀴Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie’s stay in the Cage,
6229𓀴giving us the very words of the speakers, and rising from his place
6230𓀴to show us where they stood. By these, I gathered the Prince was a
6231𓀴gracious, spirited boy, like the son of a race of polite kings, but not
6232𓀴so wise as Solomon. I gathered, too, that while he was in the Cage, he
6233𓀴was often drunk; so the fault that has since, by all accounts, made such
6234𓀴a wreck of him, had even then begun to show itself.
6235𓀴
6236𓀴We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old, thumbed,
6237𓀴greasy pack of cards, such as you may find in a mean inn; and his eyes
6238𓀴brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing.
6239𓀴
6240𓀴Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like
6241𓀴disgrace; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian
6242𓀴nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of
6243𓀴others, on the cast of painted pasteboard. To be sure, I might have
6244𓀴pleaded my fatigue, which was excuse enough; but I thought it behoved
6245𓀴that I should bear a testimony. I must have got very red in the face,
6246𓀴but I spoke steadily, and told them I had no call to be a judge
6247𓀴of others, but for my own part, it was a matter in which I had no
6248𓀴clearness.
6249𓀴
6250𓀴Cluny stopped mingling the cards. “What in deil’s name is this?” says
6251𓀴he. “What kind of Whiggish, canting talk is this, for the house of Cluny
6252𓀴Macpherson?”
6253𓀴
6254𓀴“I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour,” says Alan. “He is an
6255𓀴honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says
6256𓀴it. I bear a king’s name,” says he, cocking his hat; “and I and any that
6257𓀴I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and
6258𓀴should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you
6259𓀴and me. And I’m fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can
6260𓀴name.”
6261𓀴
6262𓀴“Sir,” says Cluny, “in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken
6263𓀴that any gentleman may follow his pleasure. If your friend would like to
6264𓀴stand on his head, he is welcome. And if either he, or you, or any other
6265𓀴man, is not preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with
6266𓀴him.”
6267𓀴
6268𓀴I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my
6269𓀴sake.
6270𓀴
6271𓀴“Sir,” said I, “I am very wearied, as Alan says; and what’s more, as
6272𓀴you are a man that likely has sons of your own, I may tell you it was a
6273𓀴promise to my father.”
6274𓀴
6275𓀴“Say nae mair, say nae mair,” said Cluny, and pointed me to a bed of
6276𓀴heather in a corner of the Cage. For all that he was displeased enough,
6277𓀴looked at me askance, and grumbled when he looked. And indeed it must
6278𓀴be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them,
6279𓀴smacked somewhat of the Covenanter, and were little in their place among
6280𓀴wild Highland Jacobites.
6281𓀴
6282𓀴What with the brandy and the venison, a strange heaviness had come over
6283𓀴me; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind
6284𓀴of trance, in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the
6285𓀴Cage. Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed; sometimes
6286𓀴I only heard voices, or men snoring, like the voice of a silly river;
6287𓀴and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again, like
6288𓀴firelight shadows on the roof. I must sometimes have spoken or cried
6289𓀴out, for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered; yet
6290𓀴I was conscious of no particular nightmare, only of a general, black,
6291𓀴abiding horror--a horror of the place I was in, and the bed I lay in,
6292𓀴and the plaids on the wall, and the voices, and the fire, and myself.
6293𓀴
6294𓀴The barber-gillie, who was a doctor too, was called in to prescribe
6295𓀴for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his
6296𓀴opinion, and was too sick even to ask for a translation. I knew well
6297𓀴enough I was ill, and that was all I cared about.
6298𓀴
6299𓀴I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass. But Alan and Cluny
6300𓀴were most of the time at the cards, and I am clear that Alan must have
6301𓀴begun by winning; for I remember sitting up, and seeing them hard at it,
6302𓀴and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on
6303𓀴the table. It looked strange enough, to see all this wealth in a nest
6304𓀴upon a cliff-side, wattled about growing trees. And even then, I
6305𓀴thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding, who had no better
6306𓀴battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds.
6307𓀴
6308𓀴The luck, it seems, changed on the second day. About noon I was wakened
6309𓀴as usual for dinner, and as usual refused to eat, and was given a dram
6310𓀴with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed. The sun was
6311𓀴shining in at the open door of the Cage, and this dazzled and offended
6312𓀴me. Cluny sat at the table, biting the pack of cards. Alan had stooped
6313𓀴over the bed, and had his face close to my eyes; to which, troubled as
6314𓀴they were with the fever, it seemed of the most shocking bigness.
6315𓀴
6316𓀴He asked me for a loan of my money.
6317𓀴
6318𓀴“What for?” said I.
6319𓀴
6320𓀴“O, just for a loan,” said he.
6321𓀴
6322𓀴“But why?” I repeated. “I don’t see.”
6323𓀴
6324𓀴“Hut, David!” said Alan, “ye wouldnae grudge me a loan?”
6325𓀴
6326𓀴I would, though, if I had had my senses! But all I thought of then was
6327𓀴to get his face away, and I handed him my money.
6328𓀴
6329𓀴On the morning of the third day, when we had been forty-eight hours in
6330𓀴the Cage, I awoke with a great relief of spirits, very weak and weary
6331𓀴indeed, but seeing things of the right size and with their honest,
6332𓀴everyday appearance. I had a mind to eat, moreover, rose from bed of my
6333𓀴own movement, and as soon as we had breakfasted, stepped to the entry of
6334𓀴the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood. It was a grey day
6335𓀴with a cool, mild air: and I sat in a dream all morning, only disturbed
6336𓀴by the passing by of Cluny’s scouts and servants coming with provisions
6337𓀴and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost
6338𓀴say he held court openly.
6339𓀴
6340𓀴When I returned, he and Alan had laid the cards aside, and were
6341𓀴questioning a gillie; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the
6342𓀴Gaelic.
6343𓀴
6344𓀴“I have no Gaelic, sir,” said I.
6345𓀴
6346𓀴Now since the card question, everything I said or did had the power of
6347𓀴annoying Cluny. “Your name has more sense than yourself, then,” said he
6348𓀴angrily, “for it’s good Gaelic. But the point is this. My scout reports
6349𓀴all clear in the south, and the question is, have ye the strength to
6350𓀴go?”
6351𓀴
6352𓀴I saw cards on the table, but no gold; only a heap of little written
6353𓀴papers, and these all on Cluny’s side. Alan, besides, had an odd
6354𓀴look, like a man not very well content; and I began to have a strong
6355𓀴misgiving.
6356𓀴
6357𓀴“I do not know if I am as well as I should be,” said I, looking at Alan;
6358𓀴“but the little money we have has a long way to carry us.”
6359𓀴
6360𓀴Alan took his under-lip into his mouth, and looked upon the ground.
6361𓀴
6362𓀴“David,” says he at last, “I’ve lost it; there’s the naked truth.”
6363𓀴
6364𓀴“My money too?” said I.
6365𓀴
6366𓀴“Your money too,” says Alan, with a groan. “Ye shouldnae have given it
6367𓀴me. I’m daft when I get to the cartes.”
6368𓀴
6369𓀴“Hoot-toot! hoot-toot!” said Cluny. “It was all daffing; it’s all
6370𓀴nonsense. Of course you’ll have your money back again, and the double of
6371𓀴it, if ye’ll make so free with me. It would be a singular thing for me
6372𓀴to keep it. It’s not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to
6373𓀴gentlemen in your situation; that would be a singular thing!” cries he,
6374𓀴and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face.
6375𓀴
6376𓀴Alan said nothing, only looked on the ground.
6377𓀴
6378𓀴“Will you step to the door with me, sir?” said I.
6379𓀴
6380𓀴Cluny said he would be very glad, and followed me readily enough, but he
6381𓀴looked flustered and put out.
6382𓀴
6383𓀴“And now, sir,” says I, “I must first acknowledge your generosity.”
6384𓀴
6385𓀴“Nonsensical nonsense!” cries Cluny. “Where’s the generosity? This is
6386𓀴just a most unfortunate affair; but what would ye have me do--boxed
6387𓀴up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine--but just set my friends to the
6388𓀴cartes, when I can get them? And if they lose, of course, it’s not to be
6389𓀴supposed----” And here he came to a pause.
6390𓀴
6391𓀴“Yes,” said I, “if they lose, you give them back their money; and if
6392𓀴they win, they carry away yours in their pouches! I have said before
6393𓀴that I grant your generosity; but to me, sir, it’s a very painful thing
6394𓀴to be placed in this position.”
6395𓀴
6396𓀴There was a little silence, in which Cluny seemed always as if he was
6397𓀴about to speak, but said nothing. All the time he grew redder and redder
6398𓀴in the face.
6399𓀴
6400𓀴“I am a young man,” said I, “and I ask your advice. Advise me as you
6401𓀴would your son. My friend fairly lost his money, after having fairly
6402𓀴gained a far greater sum of yours; can I accept it back again? Would
6403𓀴that be the right part for me to play? Whatever I do, you can see for
6404𓀴yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride.”
6405𓀴
6406𓀴“It’s rather hard on me, too, Mr. Balfour,” said Cluny, “and ye give
6407𓀴me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their
6408𓀴hurt. I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept
6409𓀴affronts; no,” he cried, with a sudden heat of anger, “nor yet to give
6410𓀴them!”
6411𓀴
6412𓀴“And so you see, sir,” said I, “there is something to be said upon my
6413𓀴side; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks. But I am
6414𓀴still waiting your opinion.”
6415𓀴
6416𓀴I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour. He looked
6417𓀴me all over with a warlike eye, and I saw the challenge at his lips.
6418𓀴But either my youth disarmed him, or perhaps his own sense of justice.
6419𓀴Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned, and not least
6420𓀴Cluny; the more credit that he took it as he did.
6421𓀴
6422𓀴“Mr. Balfour,” said he, “I think you are too nice and covenanting, but
6423𓀴for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman. Upon my
6424𓀴honest word, ye may take this money--it’s what I would tell my son--and
6425𓀴here’s my hand along with it!”
6426𓀴

6430𓀴CHAPTER XXIV
6431𓀴
6432𓀴THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE QUARREL
6433𓀴
6434𓀴
6435𓀴Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night, and went
6436𓀴down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch
6437𓀴Rannoch, whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage. This
6438𓀴fellow carried all our luggage and Alan’s great-coat in the bargain,
6439𓀴trotting along under the burthen, far less than the half of which used
6440𓀴to weigh me to the ground, like a stout hill pony with a feather; yet he
6441𓀴was a man that, in plain contest, I could have broken on my knee.
6442𓀴
6443𓀴Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered; and perhaps
6444𓀴without that relief, and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness,
6445𓀴I could not have walked at all. I was but new risen from a bed of
6446𓀴sickness; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten
6447𓀴me for much exertion; travelling, as we did, over the most dismal
6448𓀴deserts in Scotland, under a cloudy heaven, and with divided hearts
6449𓀴among the travellers.
6450𓀴
6451𓀴For long, we said nothing; marching alongside or one behind the other,
6452𓀴each with a set countenance: I, angry and proud, and drawing what
6453𓀴strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings; Alan angry
6454𓀴and ashamed, ashamed that he had lost my money, angry that I should take
6455𓀴it so ill.
6456𓀴
6457𓀴The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind; and the
6458𓀴more I approved of it, the more ashamed I grew of my approval. It would
6459𓀴be a fine, handsome, generous thing, indeed, for Alan to turn round and
6460𓀴say to me: “Go, I am in the most danger, and my company only increases
6461𓀴yours.” But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me, and say
6462𓀴to him: “You are in great danger, I am in but little; your friendship
6463𓀴is a burden; go, take your risks and bear your hardships alone----” no,
6464𓀴that was impossible; and even to think of it privily to myself, made my
6465𓀴cheeks to burn.
6466𓀴
6467𓀴And yet Alan had behaved like a child, and (what is worse) a treacherous
6468𓀴child. Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce
6469𓀴better than theft; and yet here he was trudging by my side, without a
6470𓀴penny to his name, and by what I could see, quite blithe to sponge upon
6471𓀴the money he had driven me to beg. True, I was ready to share it with
6472𓀴him; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness.
6473𓀴
6474𓀴These were the two things uppermost in my mind; and I could open my
6475𓀴mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst,
6476𓀴and said nothing, nor so much as looked once at my companion, save with
6477𓀴the tail of my eye.
6478𓀴
6479𓀴At last, upon the other side of Loch Errocht, going over a smooth, rushy
6480𓀴place, where the walking was easy, he could bear it no longer, and came
6481𓀴close to me.
6482𓀴
6483𓀴“David,” says he, “this is no way for two friends to take a small
6484𓀴accident. I have to say that I’m sorry; and so that’s said. And now if
6485𓀴you have anything, ye’d better say it.”
6486𓀴
6487𓀴“O,” says I, “I have nothing.”
6488𓀴
6489𓀴He seemed disconcerted; at which I was meanly pleased.
6490𓀴
6491𓀴“No,” said he, with rather a trembling voice, “but when I say I was to
6492𓀴blame?”
6493𓀴
6494𓀴“Why, of course, ye were to blame,” said I, coolly; “and you will bear
6495𓀴me out that I have never reproached you.”
6496𓀴
6497𓀴“Never,” says he; “but ye ken very well that ye’ve done worse. Are we to
6498𓀴part? Ye said so once before. Are ye to say it again? There’s hills and
6499𓀴heather enough between here and the two seas, David; and I will own I’m
6500𓀴no very keen to stay where I’m no wanted.”
6501𓀴
6502𓀴This pierced me like a sword, and seemed to lay bare my private
6503𓀴disloyalty.
6504𓀴
6505𓀴“Alan Breck!” I cried; and then: “Do you think I am one to turn my
6506𓀴back on you in your chief need? You dursn’t say it to my face. My whole
6507𓀴conduct’s there to give the lie to it. It’s true, I fell asleep upon
6508𓀴the muir; but that was from weariness, and you do wrong to cast it up to
6509𓀴me----”
6510𓀴
6511𓀴“Which is what I never did,” said Alan.
6512𓀴
6513𓀴“But aside from that,” I continued, “what have I done that you should
6514𓀴even me to dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and
6515𓀴it’s not likely I’ll begin with you. There are things between us that I
6516𓀴can never forget, even if you can.”
6517𓀴
6518𓀴“I will only say this to ye, David,” said Alan, very quietly, “that I
6519𓀴have long been owing ye my life, and now I owe ye money. Ye should try
6520𓀴to make that burden light for me.”
6521𓀴
6522𓀴This ought to have touched me, and in a manner it did, but the wrong
6523𓀴manner. I felt I was behaving badly; and was now not only angry with
6524𓀴Alan, but angry with myself in the bargain; and it made me the more
6525𓀴cruel.
6526𓀴
6527𓀴“You asked me to speak,” said I. “Well, then, I will. You own yourself
6528𓀴that you have done me a disservice; I have had to swallow an affront: I
6529𓀴have never reproached you, I never named the thing till you did. And
6530𓀴now you blame me,” cried I, “because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was
6531𓀴glad to be affronted. The next thing will be that I’m to go down upon my
6532𓀴knees and thank you for it! Ye should think more of others, Alan
6533𓀴Breck. If ye thought more of others, ye would perhaps speak less about
6534𓀴yourself; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an
6535𓀴offence without a word, you would be blithe to let it lie, instead of
6536𓀴making it a stick to break his back with. By your own way of it, it was
6537𓀴you that was to blame; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel.”
6538𓀴
6539𓀴“Aweel,” said Alan, “say nae mair.”
6540𓀴
6541𓀴And we fell back into our former silence; and came to our journey’s end,
6542𓀴and supped, and lay down to sleep, without another word.
6543𓀴
6544𓀴The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day, and
6545𓀴gave us his opinion as to our best route. This was to get us up at once
6546𓀴into the tops of the mountains: to go round by a circuit, turning the
6547𓀴heads of Glen Lyon, Glen Lochay, and Glen Dochart, and come down upon
6548𓀴the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth. Alan was
6549𓀴little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his
6550𓀴blood-foes, the Glenorchy Campbells. He objected that by turning to the
6551𓀴east, we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts, a race of
6552𓀴his own name and lineage, although following a different chief, and come
6553𓀴besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were
6554𓀴bound. But the gillie, who was indeed the chief man of Cluny’s scouts,
6555𓀴had good reasons to give him on all hands, naming the force of troops
6556𓀴in every district, and alleging finally (as well as I could understand)
6557𓀴that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the
6558𓀴Campbells.
6559𓀴
6560𓀴Alan gave way at last, but with only half a heart. “It’s one of the
6561𓀴dowiest countries in Scotland,” said he. “There’s naething there that I
6562𓀴ken, but heath, and crows, and Campbells. But I see that ye’re a man of
6563𓀴some penetration; and be it as ye please!”
6564𓀴
6565𓀴We set forth accordingly by this itinerary; and for the best part of
6566𓀴three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of
6567𓀴wild rivers; often buried in mist, almost continually blown and rained
6568𓀴upon, and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine. By day, we lay
6569𓀴and slept in the drenching heather; by night, incessantly clambered upon
6570𓀴break-neck hills and among rude crags. We often wandered; we were often
6571𓀴so involved in fog, that we must lie quiet till it lightened. A fire was
6572𓀴never to be thought of. Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold
6573𓀴meat that we had carried from the Cage; and as for drink, Heaven knows
6574𓀴we had no want of water.
6575𓀴
6576𓀴This was a dreadful time, rendered the more dreadful by the gloom of
6577𓀴the weather and the country. I was never warm; my teeth chattered in my
6578𓀴head; I was troubled with a very sore throat, such as I had on the isle;
6579𓀴I had a painful stitch in my side, which never left me; and when I slept
6580𓀴in my wet bed, with the rain beating above and the mud oozing below me,
6581𓀴it was to live over again in fancy the worst part of my adventures--to
6582𓀴see the tower of Shaws lit by lightning, Ransome carried below on the
6583𓀴men’s backs, Shuan dying on the round-house floor, or Colin Campbell
6584𓀴grasping at the bosom of his coat. From such broken slumbers, I would be
6585𓀴aroused in the gloaming, to sit up in the same puddle where I had slept,
6586𓀴and sup cold drammach; the rain driving sharp in my face or running
6587𓀴down my back in icy trickles; the mist enfolding us like as in a gloomy
6588𓀴chamber--or, perhaps, if the wind blew, falling suddenly apart and
6589𓀴showing us the gulf of some dark valley where the streams were crying
6590𓀴aloud.
6591𓀴
6592𓀴The sound of an infinite number of rivers came up from all round. In
6593𓀴this steady rain the springs of the mountain were broken up; every glen
6594𓀴gushed water like a cistern; every stream was in high spate, and had
6595𓀴filled and overflowed its channel. During our night tramps, it was
6596𓀴solemn to hear the voice of them below in the valleys, now booming like
6597𓀴thunder, now with an angry cry. I could well understand the story of the
6598𓀴Water Kelpie, that demon of the streams, who is fabled to keep wailing
6599𓀴and roaring at the ford until the coming of the doomed traveller. Alan I
6600𓀴saw believed it, or half believed it; and when the cry of the river rose
6601𓀴more than usually sharp, I was little surprised (though, of course, I
6602𓀴would still be shocked) to see him cross himself in the manner of the
6603𓀴Catholics.
6604𓀴
6605𓀴During all these horrid wanderings we had no familiarity, scarcely even
6606𓀴that of speech. The truth is that I was sickening for my grave, which
6607𓀴is my best excuse. But besides that I was of an unforgiving disposition
6608𓀴from my birth, slow to take offence, slower to forget it, and now
6609𓀴incensed both against my companion and myself. For the best part of two
6610𓀴days he was unweariedly kind; silent, indeed, but always ready to help,
6611𓀴and always hoping (as I could very well see) that my displeasure would
6612𓀴blow by. For the same length of time I stayed in myself, nursing my
6613𓀴anger, roughly refusing his services, and passing him over with my eyes
6614𓀴as if he had been a bush or a stone.
6615𓀴
6616𓀴The second night, or rather the peep of the third day, found us upon a
6617𓀴very open hill, so that we could not follow our usual plan and lie down
6618𓀴immediately to eat and sleep. Before we had reached a place of shelter,
6619𓀴the grey had come pretty clear, for though it still rained, the clouds
6620𓀴ran higher; and Alan, looking in my face, showed some marks of concern.
6621𓀴
6622𓀴“Ye had better let me take your pack,” said he, for perhaps the ninth
6623𓀴time since we had parted from the scout beside Loch Rannoch.
6624𓀴
6625𓀴“I do very well, I thank you,” said I, as cold as ice.
6626𓀴
6627𓀴Alan flushed darkly. “I’ll not offer it again,” he said. “I’m not a
6628𓀴patient man, David.”
6629𓀴
6630𓀴“I never said you were,” said I, which was exactly the rude, silly
6631𓀴speech of a boy of ten.
6632𓀴
6633𓀴Alan made no answer at the time, but his conduct answered for him.
6634𓀴Henceforth, it is to be thought, he quite forgave himself for the affair
6635𓀴at Cluny’s; cocked his hat again, walked jauntily, whistled airs, and
6636𓀴looked at me upon one side with a provoking smile.
6637𓀴
6638𓀴The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country
6639𓀴of Balquhidder. It came clear and cold, with a touch in the air like
6640𓀴frost, and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars
6641𓀴bright. The streams were full, of course, and still made a great noise
6642𓀴among the hills; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the
6643𓀴Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of weather
6644𓀴came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it)
6645𓀴my very clothes “abhorred me.” I was dead weary, deadly sick and full
6646𓀴of pains and shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the
6647𓀴sound of it confused my ears. In this poor state I had to bear from
6648𓀴my companion something in the nature of a persecution. He spoke a good
6649𓀴deal, and never without a taunt. “Whig” was the best name he had to give
6650𓀴me. “Here,” he would say, “here’s a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I
6651𓀴ken you’re a fine jumper!” And so on; all the time with a gibing voice
6652𓀴and face.
6653𓀴
6654𓀴I knew it was my own doing, and no one else’s; but I was too miserable
6655𓀴to repent. I felt I could drag myself but little farther; pretty soon, I
6656𓀴must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox, and
6657𓀴my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast. My head was light
6658𓀴perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began to glory in the
6659𓀴thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles
6660𓀴besieging my last moments. Alan would repent then, I thought; he would
6661𓀴remember, when I was dead, how much he owed me, and the remembrance
6662𓀴would be torture. So I went like a sick, silly, and bad-hearted
6663𓀴schoolboy, feeding my anger against a fellow-man, when I would have
6664𓀴been better on my knees, crying on God for mercy. And at each of Alan’s
6665𓀴taunts, I hugged myself. “Ah!” thinks I to myself, “I have a better
6666𓀴taunt in readiness; when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a
6667𓀴buffet in your face; ah, what a revenge! ah, how you will regret your
6668𓀴ingratitude and cruelty!”
6669𓀴
6670𓀴All the while, I was growing worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg
6671𓀴simply doubling under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I
6672𓀴was afoot so briskly, and set off again with such a natural manner,
6673𓀴that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes of heat went over me, and then
6674𓀴spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last
6675𓀴I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that,
6676𓀴there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my
6677𓀴anger blaze, and be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had
6678𓀴just called me “Whig.” I stopped.
6679𓀴
6680𓀴“Mr. Stewart,” said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string,
6681𓀴“you are older than I am, and should know your manners. Do you think
6682𓀴it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth? I
6683𓀴thought, where folk differed, it was the part of gentlemen to differ
6684𓀴civilly; and if I did not, I may tell you I could find a better taunt
6685𓀴than some of yours.”
6686𓀴
6687𓀴Alan had stopped opposite to me, his hat cocked, his hands in his
6688𓀴breeches pockets, his head a little on one side. He listened, smiling
6689𓀴evilly, as I could see by the starlight; and when I had done he began to
6690𓀴whistle a Jacobite air. It was the air made in mockery of General Cope’s
6691𓀴defeat at Preston Pans:
6692𓀴
6693𓀴     “Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye waukin’ yet?
6694𓀴     And are your drums a-beatin’ yet?”
6695𓀴
6696𓀴And it came in my mind that Alan, on the day of that battle, had been
6697𓀴engaged upon the royal side.
6698𓀴
6699𓀴“Why do ye take that air, Mr. Stewart?” said I. “Is that to remind me
6700𓀴you have been beaten on both sides?”
6701𓀴
6702𓀴The air stopped on Alan’s lips. “David!” said he.
6703𓀴
6704𓀴“But it’s time these manners ceased,” I continued; “and I mean you shall
6705𓀴henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells.”
6706𓀴
6707𓀴“I am a Stewart--” began Alan.
6708𓀴
6709𓀴“O!” says I, “I ken ye bear a king’s name. But you are to remember,
6710𓀴since I have been in the Highlands, I have seen a good many of those
6711𓀴that bear it; and the best I can say of them is this, that they would be
6712𓀴none the worse of washing.”
6713𓀴
6714𓀴“Do you know that you insult me?” said Alan, very low.
6715𓀴
6716𓀴“I am sorry for that,” said I, “for I am not done; and if you distaste
6717𓀴the sermon, I doubt the pirliecue[29] will please you as little. You have
6718𓀴been chased in the field by the grown men of my party; it seems a poor
6719𓀴kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the Campbells and the Whigs
6720𓀴have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare. It behoves you to
6721𓀴speak of them as of your betters.”
6722𓀴
6723𓀴     [29] A second sermon.
6724𓀴
6725𓀴Alan stood quite still, the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him
6726𓀴in the wind.
6727𓀴
6728𓀴“This is a pity,” he said at last. “There are things said that cannot be
6729𓀴passed over.”
6730𓀴
6731𓀴“I never asked you to,” said I. “I am as ready as yourself.”
6732𓀴
6733𓀴“Ready?” said he.
6734𓀴
6735𓀴“Ready,” I repeated. “I am no blower and boaster like some that I could
6736𓀴name. Come on!” And drawing my sword, I fell on guard as Alan himself
6737𓀴had taught me.
6738𓀴
6739𓀴“David!” he cried. “Are ye daft? I cannae draw upon ye, David. It’s
6740𓀴fair murder.”
6741𓀴
6742𓀴“That was your look-out when you insulted me,” said I.
6743𓀴
6744𓀴“It’s the truth!” cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his
6745𓀴mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity. “It’s the bare truth,”
6746𓀴 he said, and drew his sword. But before I could touch his blade with
6747𓀴mine, he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground. “Na, na,” he
6748𓀴kept saying, “na, na--I cannae, I cannae.”
6749𓀴
6750𓀴At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself
6751𓀴only sick, and sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have
6752𓀴given the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken,
6753𓀴who can recapture it? I minded me of all Alan’s kindness and courage in
6754𓀴the past, how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil
6755𓀴days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever
6756𓀴that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon
6757𓀴me seemed to redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for
6758𓀴sharpness. I thought I must have swooned where I stood.
6759𓀴
6760𓀴This it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had
6761𓀴said; it was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but
6762𓀴where an apology was vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to
6763𓀴my side. I put my pride away from me. “Alan!” I said; “if ye cannae help
6764𓀴me, I must just die here.”
6765𓀴
6766𓀴He started up sitting, and looked at me.
6767𓀴
6768𓀴“It’s true,” said I. “I’m by with it. O, let me get into the bield of a
6769𓀴house--I’ll can die there easier.” I had no need to pretend; whether I
6770𓀴chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart
6771𓀴of stone.
6772𓀴
6773𓀴“Can ye walk?” asked Alan.
6774𓀴
6775𓀴“No,” said I, “not without help. This last hour my legs have been
6776𓀴fainting under me; I’ve a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I
6777𓀴cannae breathe right. If I die, ye’ll can forgive me, Alan? In my heart,
6778𓀴I liked ye fine--even when I was the angriest.”
6779𓀴
6780𓀴“Wheesht, wheesht!” cried Alan. “Dinna say that! David man, ye ken--” He
6781𓀴shut his mouth upon a sob. “Let me get my arm about ye,” he continued;
6782𓀴“that’s the way! Now lean upon me hard. Gude kens where there’s a house!
6783𓀴We’re in Balwhidder, too; there should be no want of houses, no, nor
6784𓀴friends’ houses here. Do ye gang easier so, Davie?”
6785𓀴
6786𓀴“Ay,” said I, “I can be doing this way;” and I pressed his arm with my
6787𓀴hand.
6788𓀴
6789𓀴Again he came near sobbing. “Davie,” said he, “I’m no a right man at
6790𓀴all; I have neither sense nor kindness; I could nae remember ye were
6791𓀴just a bairn, I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet; Davie, ye’ll
6792𓀴have to try and forgive me.”
6793𓀴
6794𓀴“O man, let’s say no more about it!” said I. “We’re neither one of us
6795𓀴to mend the other--that’s the truth! We must just bear and forbear, man
6796𓀴Alan. O, but my stitch is sore! Is there nae house?”
6797𓀴
6798𓀴“I’ll find a house to ye, David,” he said, stoutly. “We’ll follow down
6799𓀴the burn, where there’s bound to be houses. My poor man, will ye no be
6800𓀴better on my back?”
6801𓀴
6802𓀴“O, Alan,” says I, “and me a good twelve inches taller?”
6803𓀴
6804𓀴“Ye’re no such a thing,” cried Alan, with a start. “There may be a
6805𓀴trifling matter of an inch or two; I’m no saying I’m just exactly what
6806𓀴ye would call a tall man, whatever; and I dare say,” he added, his voice
6807𓀴tailing off in a laughable manner, “now when I come to think of it, I
6808𓀴dare say ye’ll be just about right. Ay, it’ll be a foot, or near hand;
6809𓀴or may be even mair!”
6810𓀴
6811𓀴It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of
6812𓀴some fresh quarrel. I could have laughed, had not my stitch caught me so
6813𓀴hard; but if I had laughed, I think I must have wept too.
6814𓀴
6815𓀴“Alan,” cried I, “what makes ye so good to me? What makes ye care for
6816𓀴such a thankless fellow?”
6817𓀴
6818𓀴“‘Deed, and I don’t know” said Alan. “For just precisely what I thought
6819𓀴I liked about ye, was that ye never quarrelled:--and now I like ye
6820𓀴better!”
6821𓀴
6822𓀴
6823𓀴
6824𓀴
6825𓀴CHAPTER XXV
6826𓀴
6827𓀴IN BALQUHIDDER
6828𓀴
6829𓀴
6830𓀴At the door of the first house we came to, Alan knocked, which was of
6831𓀴no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of
6832𓀴Balquhidder. No great clan held rule there; it was filled and disputed
6833𓀴by small septs, and broken remnants, and what they call “chiefless
6834𓀴folk,” driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith
6835𓀴by the advance of the Campbells. Here were Stewarts and Maclarens, which
6836𓀴came to the same thing, for the Maclarens followed Alan’s chief in war,
6837𓀴and made but one clan with Appin. Here, too, were many of that old,
6838𓀴proscribed, nameless, red-handed clan of the Macgregors. They had always
6839𓀴been ill-considered, and now worse than ever, having credit with no side
6840𓀴or party in the whole country of Scotland. Their chief, Macgregor of
6841𓀴Macgregor, was in exile; the more immediate leader of that part of them
6842𓀴about Balquhidder, James More, Rob Roy’s eldest son, lay waiting his
6843𓀴trial in Edinburgh Castle; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and
6844𓀴Lowlander, with the Grahames, the Maclarens, and the Stewarts; and Alan,
6845𓀴who took up the quarrel of any friend, however distant, was extremely
6846𓀴wishful to avoid them.
6847𓀴
6848𓀴Chance served us very well; for it was a household of Maclarens that we
6849𓀴found, where Alan was not only welcome for his name’s sake but known
6850𓀴by reputation. Here then I was got to bed without delay, and a doctor
6851𓀴fetched, who found me in a sorry plight. But whether because he was a
6852𓀴very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay bedridden for no
6853𓀴more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again
6854𓀴with a good heart.
6855𓀴
6856𓀴All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him, and
6857𓀴indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with
6858𓀴the two or three friends that were let into the secret. He hid by day
6859𓀴in a hole of the braes under a little wood; and at night, when the coast
6860𓀴was clear, would come into the house to visit me. I need not say if I
6861𓀴was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing good
6862𓀴enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our
6863𓀴host) had a pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of
6864𓀴music, this time of my recovery was quite a festival, and we commonly
6865𓀴turned night into day.
6866𓀴
6867𓀴The soldiers let us be; although once a party of two companies and some
6868𓀴dragoons went by in the bottom of the valley, where I could see them
6869𓀴through the window as I lay in bed. What was much more astonishing, no
6870𓀴magistrate came near me, and there was no question put of whence I came
6871𓀴or whither I was going; and in that time of excitement, I was as free of
6872𓀴all inquiry as though I had lain in a desert. Yet my presence was known
6873𓀴before I left to all the people in Balquhidder and the adjacent parts;
6874𓀴many coming about the house on visits and these (after the custom of the
6875𓀴country) spreading the news among their neighbours. The bills, too, had
6876𓀴now been printed. There was one pinned near the foot of my bed, where
6877𓀴I could read my own not very flattering portrait and, in larger
6878𓀴characters, the amount of the blood money that had been set upon my
6879𓀴life. Duncan Dhu and the rest that knew that I had come there in Alan’s
6880𓀴company, could have entertained no doubt of who I was; and many others
6881𓀴must have had their guess. For though I had changed my clothes, I could
6882𓀴not change my age or person; and Lowland boys of eighteen were not so
6883𓀴rife in these parts of the world, and above all about that time, that
6884𓀴they could fail to put one thing with another, and connect me with the
6885𓀴bill. So it was, at least. Other folk keep a secret among two or three
6886𓀴near friends, and somehow it leaks out; but among these clansmen, it is
6887𓀴told to a whole countryside, and they will keep it for a century.
6888𓀴
6889𓀴There was but one thing happened worth narrating; and that is the visit
6890𓀴I had of Robin Oig, one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy. He was
6891𓀴sought upon all sides on a charge of carrying a young woman from
6892𓀴Balfron and marrying her (as was alleged) by force; yet he stepped about
6893𓀴Balquhidder like a gentleman in his own walled policy. It was he who had
6894𓀴shot James Maclaren at the plough stilts, a quarrel never satisfied; yet
6895𓀴he walked into the house of his blood enemies as a rider[30] might into a
6896𓀴public inn.
6897𓀴
6898𓀴     [30] Commercial traveller.
6899𓀴
6900𓀴Duncan had time to pass me word of who it was; and we looked at one
6901𓀴another in concern. You should understand, it was then close upon the
6902𓀴time of Alan’s coming; the two were little likely to agree; and yet if
6903𓀴we sent word or sought to make a signal, it was sure to arouse suspicion
6904𓀴in a man under so dark a cloud as the Macgregor.
6905𓀴
6906𓀴He came in with a great show of civility, but like a man among
6907𓀴inferiors; took off his bonnet to Mrs. Maclaren, but clapped it on his
6908𓀴head again to speak to Duncan; and having thus set himself (as he would
6909𓀴have thought) in a proper light, came to my bedside and bowed.
6910𓀴
6911𓀴“I am given to know, sir,” says he, “that your name is Balfour.”
6912𓀴
6913𓀴“They call me David Balfour,” said I, “at your service.”
6914𓀴
6915𓀴“I would give ye my name in return, sir,” he replied, “but it’s one
6916𓀴somewhat blown upon of late days; and it’ll perhaps suffice if I tell
6917𓀴ye that I am own brother to James More Drummond or Macgregor, of whom ye
6918𓀴will scarce have failed to hear.”
6919𓀴
6920𓀴“No, sir,” said I, a little alarmed; “nor yet of your father,
6921𓀴Macgregor-Campbell.” And I sat up and bowed in bed; for I thought best
6922𓀴to compliment him, in case he was proud of having had an outlaw to his
6923𓀴father.
6924𓀴
6925𓀴He bowed in return. “But what I am come to say, sir,” he went on, “is
6926𓀴this. In the year ‘45, my brother raised a part of the ‘Gregara’ and
6927𓀴marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side; and the
6928𓀴surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother’s leg when it
6929𓀴was broken in the brush at Preston Pans, was a gentleman of the same
6930𓀴name precisely as yourself. He was brother to Balfour of Baith; and if
6931𓀴you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman’s
6932𓀴kin, I have come to put myself and my people at your command.”
6933𓀴
6934𓀴You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger’s
6935𓀴dog; my uncle, to be sure, had prated of some of our high connections,
6936𓀴but nothing to the present purpose; and there was nothing left me but
6937𓀴that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell.
6938𓀴
6939𓀴Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about, turned his
6940𓀴back upon me without a sign of salutation, and as he went towards the
6941𓀴door, I could hear him telling Duncan that I was “only some kinless loon
6942𓀴that didn’t know his own father.” Angry as I was at these words, and
6943𓀴ashamed of my own ignorance, I could scarce keep from smiling that a
6944𓀴man who was under the lash of the law (and was indeed hanged some three
6945𓀴years later) should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances.
6946𓀴
6947𓀴Just in the door, he met Alan coming in; and the two drew back and
6948𓀴looked at each other like strange dogs. They were neither of them big
6949𓀴men, but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride. Each wore a sword,
6950𓀴and by a movement of his haunch, thrust clear the hilt of it, so that it
6951𓀴might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn.
6952𓀴
6953𓀴“Mr. Stewart, I am thinking,” says Robin.
6954𓀴
6955𓀴“Troth, Mr. Macgregor, it’s not a name to be ashamed of,” answered Alan.
6956𓀴
6957𓀴“I did not know ye were in my country, sir,” says Robin.
6958𓀴
6959𓀴“It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the
6960𓀴Maclarens,” says Alan.
6961𓀴
6962𓀴“That’s a kittle point,” returned the other. “There may be two words to
6963𓀴say to that. But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your
6964𓀴sword?”
6965𓀴
6966𓀴“Unless ye were born deaf, Mr. Macgregor, ye will have heard a good deal
6967𓀴more than that,” says Alan. “I am not the only man that can draw steel
6968𓀴in Appin; and when my kinsman and captain, Ardshiel, had a talk with a
6969𓀴gentleman of your name, not so many years back, I could never hear that
6970𓀴the Macgregor had the best of it.”
6971𓀴
6972𓀴“Do ye mean my father, sir?” says Robin.
6973𓀴
6974𓀴“Well, I wouldnae wonder,” said Alan. “The gentleman I have in my mind
6975𓀴had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name.”
6976𓀴
6977𓀴“My father was an old man,” returned Robin.
6978𓀴
6979𓀴“The match was unequal. You and me would make a better pair, sir.”
6980𓀴
6981𓀴“I was thinking that,” said Alan.
6982𓀴
6983𓀴I was half out of bed, and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these
6984𓀴fighting cocks, ready to intervene upon the least occasion. But when
6985𓀴that word was uttered, it was a case of now or never; and Duncan, with
6986𓀴something of a white face to be sure, thrust himself between.
6987𓀴
6988𓀴“Gentlemen,” said he, “I will have been thinking of a very different
6989𓀴matter, whateffer. Here are my pipes, and here are you two gentlemen who
6990𓀴are baith acclaimed pipers. It’s an auld dispute which one of ye’s the
6991𓀴best. Here will be a braw chance to settle it.”
6992𓀴
6993𓀴“Why, sir,” said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had
6994𓀴not so much as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him, “why, sir,”
6995𓀴 says Alan, “I think I will have heard some sough[31] of the sort. Have ye
6996𓀴music, as folk say? Are ye a bit of a piper?”
6997𓀴
6998𓀴     [31] Rumour.
6999𓀴
7000𓀴“I can pipe like a Macrimmon!” cries Robin.
7001𓀴
7002𓀴“And that is a very bold word,” quoth Alan.
7003𓀴
7004𓀴“I have made bolder words good before now,” returned Robin, “and that
7005𓀴against better adversaries.”
7006𓀴
7007𓀴“It is easy to try that,” says Alan.
7008𓀴
7009𓀴Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his
7010𓀴principal possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a
7011𓀴bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of
7012𓀴old whiskey, strained honey and sweet cream, slowly beaten together in
7013𓀴the right order and proportion. The two enemies were still on the very
7014𓀴breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat
7015𓀴fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren pressed them to taste
7016𓀴his mutton-ham and “the wife’s brose,” reminding them the wife was out
7017𓀴of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection.
7018𓀴But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath.
7019𓀴
7020𓀴“I would have ye to remark, sir,” said Alan, “that I havenae broken
7021𓀴bread for near upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than
7022𓀴any brose in Scotland.”
7023𓀴
7024𓀴“I will take no advantages, Mr. Stewart,” replied Robin. “Eat and drink;
7025𓀴I’ll follow you.”
7026𓀴
7027𓀴Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to
7028𓀴Mrs. Maclaren; and then after a great number of civilities, Robin took
7029𓀴the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner.
7030𓀴
7031𓀴“Ay, ye can blow” said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival,
7032𓀴he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin’s; and
7033𓀴then wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with
7034𓀴a perfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the
7035𓀴“warblers.”
7036𓀴
7037𓀴I had been pleased with Robin’s playing, Alan’s ravished me.
7038𓀴
7039𓀴“That’s no very bad, Mr. Stewart,” said the rival, “but ye show a poor
7040𓀴device in your warblers.”
7041𓀴
7042𓀴“Me!” cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. “I give ye the lie.”
7043𓀴
7044𓀴“Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then,” said Robin, “that ye
7045𓀴seek to change them for the sword?”
7046𓀴
7047𓀴“And that’s very well said, Mr. Macgregor,” returned Alan; “and in the
7048𓀴meantime” (laying a strong accent on the word) “I take back the lie. I
7049𓀴appeal to Duncan.”
7050𓀴
7051𓀴“Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody,” said Robin. “Ye’re a far better
7052𓀴judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder: for it’s a God’s truth that
7053𓀴you’re a very creditable piper for a Stewart. Hand me the pipes.” Alan
7054𓀴did as he asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of
7055𓀴Alan’s variations, which it seemed that he remembered perfectly.
7056𓀴
7057𓀴“Ay, ye have music,” said Alan, gloomily.
7058𓀴
7059𓀴“And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart,” said Robin; and taking up
7060𓀴the variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a
7061𓀴purpose, with such ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and
7062𓀴so quick a knack in the grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.
7063𓀴
7064𓀴As for Alan, his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his
7065𓀴fingers, like a man under some deep affront. “Enough!” he cried. “Ye can
7066𓀴blow the pipes--make the most of that.” And he made as if to rise.
7067𓀴
7068𓀴But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck
7069𓀴into the slow measure of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in
7070𓀴itself, and nobly played; but it seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar
7071𓀴to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan. The first notes
7072𓀴were scarce out, before there came a change in his face; when the time
7073𓀴quickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that
7074𓀴piece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he
7075𓀴had no thought but for the music.
7076𓀴
7077𓀴“Robin Oig,” he said, when it was done, “ye are a great piper. I am not
7078𓀴fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye. Body of me! ye have mair music
7079𓀴in your sporran than I have in my head! And though it still sticks in
7080𓀴my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel,
7081𓀴I warn ye beforehand--it’ll no be fair! It would go against my heart to
7082𓀴haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!”
7083𓀴
7084𓀴Thereupon that quarrel was made up; all night long the brose was going
7085𓀴and the pipes changing hands; and the day had come pretty bright, and
7086𓀴the three men were none the better for what they had been taking, before
7087𓀴Robin as much as thought upon the road.
7088𓀴

7091𓀴
7092𓀴CHAPTER XXVI
7093𓀴
7094𓀴END OF THE FLIGHT: WE PASS THE FORTH
7095𓀴
7096𓀴
7097𓀴The month, as I have said, was not yet out, but it was already far
7098𓀴through August, and beautiful warm weather, with every sign of an early
7099𓀴and great harvest, when I was pronounced able for my journey. Our money
7100𓀴was now run to so low an ebb that we must think first of all on speed;
7101𓀴for if we came not soon to Mr. Rankeillor’s, or if when we came there he
7102𓀴should fail to help me, we must surely starve. In Alan’s view, besides,
7103𓀴the hunt must have now greatly slackened; and the line of the Forth and
7104𓀴even Stirling Bridge, which is the main pass over that river, would be
7105𓀴watched with little interest.
7106𓀴
7107𓀴“It’s a chief principle in military affairs,” said he, “to go where
7108𓀴ye are least expected. Forth is our trouble; ye ken the saying, ‘Forth
7109𓀴bridles the wild Hielandman.’ Well, if we seek to creep round about
7110𓀴the head of that river and come down by Kippen or Balfron, it’s just
7111𓀴precisely there that they’ll be looking to lay hands on us. But if we
7112𓀴stave on straight to the auld Brig of Stirling, I’ll lay my sword they
7113𓀴let us pass unchallenged.”
7114𓀴
7115𓀴The first night, accordingly, we pushed to the house of a Maclaren in
7116𓀴Strathire, a friend of Duncan’s, where we slept the twenty-first of the
7117𓀴month, and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make
7118𓀴another easy stage. The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the
7119𓀴hillside in Uam Var, within view of a herd of deer, the happiest ten
7120𓀴hours of sleep in a fine, breathing sunshine and on bone-dry ground,
7121𓀴that I have ever tasted. That night we struck Allan Water, and followed
7122𓀴it down; and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole Carse of
7123𓀴Stirling underfoot, as flat as a pancake, with the town and castle on a
7124𓀴hill in the midst of it, and the moon shining on the Links of Forth.
7125𓀴
7126𓀴“Now,” said Alan, “I kenna if ye care, but ye’re in your own land again.
7127𓀴We passed the Hieland Line in the first hour; and now if we could but
7128𓀴pass yon crooked water, we might cast our bonnets in the air.”
7129𓀴
7130𓀴In Allan Water, near by where it falls into the Forth, we found a little
7131𓀴sandy islet, overgrown with burdock, butterbur and the like low plants,
7132𓀴that would just cover us if we lay flat. Here it was we made our camp,
7133𓀴within plain view of Stirling Castle, whence we could hear the drums
7134𓀴beat as some part of the garrison paraded. Shearers worked all day in
7135𓀴a field on one side of the river, and we could hear the stones going
7136𓀴on the hooks and the voices and even the words of the men talking. It
7137𓀴behoved to lie close and keep silent. But the sand of the little isle
7138𓀴was sun-warm, the green plants gave us shelter for our heads, we had
7139𓀴food and drink in plenty; and to crown all, we were within sight of
7140𓀴safety.
7141𓀴
7142𓀴As soon as the shearers quit their work and the dusk began to fall,
7143𓀴we waded ashore and struck for the Bridge of Stirling, keeping to the
7144𓀴fields and under the field fences.
7145𓀴
7146𓀴The bridge is close under the castle hill, an old, high, narrow bridge
7147𓀴with pinnacles along the parapet; and you may conceive with how much
7148𓀴interest I looked upon it, not only as a place famous in history, but as
7149𓀴the very doors of salvation to Alan and myself. The moon was not yet up
7150𓀴when we came there; a few lights shone along the front of the fortress,
7151𓀴and lower down a few lighted windows in the town; but it was all mighty
7152𓀴still, and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage.
7153𓀴
7154𓀴I was for pushing straight across; but Alan was more wary.
7155𓀴
7156𓀴“It looks unco’ quiet,” said he; “but for all that we’ll lie down here
7157𓀴cannily behind a dyke, and make sure.”
7158𓀴
7159𓀴So we lay for about a quarter of an hour, whiles whispering, whiles
7160𓀴lying still and hearing nothing earthly but the washing of the water on
7161𓀴the piers. At last there came by an old, hobbling woman with a crutch
7162𓀴stick; who first stopped a little, close to where we lay, and bemoaned
7163𓀴herself and the long way she had travelled; and then set forth again up
7164𓀴the steep spring of the bridge. The woman was so little, and the night
7165𓀴still so dark, that we soon lost sight of her; only heard the sound of
7166𓀴her steps, and her stick, and a cough that she had by fits, draw slowly
7167𓀴farther away.
7168𓀴
7169𓀴“She’s bound to be across now,” I whispered.
7170𓀴
7171𓀴“Na,” said Alan, “her foot still sounds boss[32] upon the bridge.”
7172𓀴
7173𓀴     [32] Hollow.
7174𓀴
7175𓀴And just then--“Who goes?” cried a voice, and we heard the butt of
7176𓀴a musket rattle on the stones. I must suppose the sentry had been
7177𓀴sleeping, so that had we tried, we might have passed unseen; but he was
7178𓀴awake now, and the chance forfeited.
7179𓀴
7180𓀴“This’ll never do,” said Alan. “This’ll never, never do for us, David.”
7181𓀴
7182𓀴And without another word, he began to crawl away through the fields; and
7183𓀴a little after, being well out of eye-shot, got to his feet again, and
7184𓀴struck along a road that led to the eastward. I could not conceive what
7185𓀴he was doing; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment,
7186𓀴that I was little likely to be pleased with anything. A moment back
7187𓀴and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor’s door to claim my
7188𓀴inheritance, like a hero in a ballad; and here was I back again, a
7189𓀴wandering, hunted blackguard, on the wrong side of Forth.
7190𓀴
7191𓀴“Well?” said I.
7192𓀴
7193𓀴“Well,” said Alan, “what would ye have? They’re none such fools as I
7194𓀴took them for. We have still the Forth to pass, Davie--weary fall the
7195𓀴rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it!”
7196𓀴
7197𓀴“And why go east?” said I.
7198𓀴
7199𓀴“Ou, just upon the chance!” said he. “If we cannae pass the river, we’ll
7200𓀴have to see what we can do for the firth.”
7201𓀴
7202𓀴“There are fords upon the river, and none upon the firth,” said I.
7203𓀴
7204𓀴“To be sure there are fords, and a bridge forbye,” quoth Alan; “and of
7205𓀴what service, when they are watched?”
7206𓀴
7207𓀴“Well,” said I, “but a river can be swum.”
7208𓀴
7209𓀴“By them that have the skill of it,” returned he; “but I have yet to
7210𓀴hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise; and for
7211𓀴my own part, I swim like a stone.”
7212𓀴
7213𓀴“I’m not up to you in talking back, Alan,” I said; “but I can see we’re
7214𓀴making bad worse. If it’s hard to pass a river, it stands to reason it
7215𓀴must be worse to pass a sea.”
7216𓀴
7217𓀴“But there’s such a thing as a boat,” says Alan, “or I’m the more
7218𓀴deceived.”
7219𓀴
7220𓀴“Ay, and such a thing as money,” says I. “But for us that have neither
7221𓀴one nor other, they might just as well not have been invented.”
7222𓀴
7223𓀴“Ye think so?” said Alan.
7224𓀴
7225𓀴“I do that,” said I.
7226𓀴
7227𓀴“David,” says he, “ye’re a man of small invention and less faith. But
7228𓀴let me set my wits upon the hone, and if I cannae beg, borrow, nor yet
7229𓀴steal a boat, I’ll make one!”
7230𓀴
7231𓀴“I think I see ye!” said I. “And what’s more than all that: if ye pass a
7232𓀴bridge, it can tell no tales; but if we pass the firth, there’s the boat
7233𓀴on the wrong side--somebody must have brought it--the country-side will
7234𓀴all be in a bizz---”
7235𓀴
7236𓀴“Man!” cried Alan, “if I make a boat, I’ll make a body to take it back
7237𓀴again! So deave me with no more of your nonsense, but walk (for that’s
7238𓀴what you’ve got to do)--and let Alan think for ye.”
7239𓀴
7240𓀴All night, then, we walked through the north side of the Carse under
7241𓀴the high line of the Ochil mountains; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and
7242𓀴Culross, all of which we avoided: and about ten in the morning, mighty
7243𓀴hungry and tired, came to the little clachan of Limekilns. This is a
7244𓀴place that sits near in by the water-side, and looks across the Hope to
7245𓀴the town of the Queensferry. Smoke went up from both of these, and from
7246𓀴other villages and farms upon all hands. The fields were being reaped;
7247𓀴two ships lay anchored, and boats were coming and going on the Hope.
7248𓀴It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me; and I could not take
7249𓀴my fill of gazing at these comfortable, green, cultivated hills and the
7250𓀴busy people both of the field and sea.
7251𓀴
7252𓀴For all that, there was Mr. Rankeillor’s house on the south shore, where
7253𓀴I had no doubt wealth awaited me; and here was I upon the north, clad in
7254𓀴poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion, with three silver shillings
7255𓀴left to me of all my fortune, a price set upon my head, and an outlawed
7256𓀴man for my sole company.
7257𓀴
7258𓀴“O, Alan!” said I, “to think of it! Over there, there’s all that heart
7259𓀴could want waiting me; and the birds go over, and the boats go over--all
7260𓀴that please can go, but just me only! O, man, but it’s a heart-break!”
7261𓀴
7262𓀴In Limekilns we entered a small change-house, which we only knew to be a
7263𓀴public by the wand over the door, and bought some bread and cheese from
7264𓀴a good-looking lass that was the servant. This we carried with us in a
7265𓀴bundle, meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore,
7266𓀴that we saw some third part of a mile in front. As we went, I kept
7267𓀴looking across the water and sighing to myself; and though I took no
7268𓀴heed of it, Alan had fallen into a muse. At last he stopped in the way.
7269𓀴
7270𓀴“Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of?” says he, tapping on
7271𓀴the bread and cheese.
7272𓀴
7273𓀴“To be sure,” said I, “and a bonny lass she was.”
7274𓀴
7275𓀴“Ye thought that?” cries he. “Man, David, that’s good news.”
7276𓀴
7277𓀴“In the name of all that’s wonderful, why so?” says I. “What good can
7278𓀴that do?”
7279𓀴
7280𓀴“Well,” said Alan, with one of his droll looks, “I was rather in hopes
7281𓀴it would maybe get us that boat.”
7282𓀴
7283𓀴“If it were the other way about, it would be liker it,” said I.
7284𓀴
7285𓀴“That’s all that you ken, ye see,” said Alan. “I don’t want the lass to
7286𓀴fall in love with ye, I want her to be sorry for ye, David; to which end
7287𓀴there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty. Let me
7288𓀴see” (looking me curiously over). “I wish ye were a wee thing paler; but
7289𓀴apart from that ye’ll do fine for my purpose--ye have a fine, hang-dog,
7290𓀴rag-and-tatter, clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye, as if ye had
7291𓀴stolen the coat from a potato-bogle. Come; right about, and back to the
7292𓀴change-house for that boat of ours.”
7293𓀴
7294𓀴I followed him, laughing.
7295𓀴
7296𓀴“David Balfour,” said he, “ye’re a very funny gentleman by your way of
7297𓀴it, and this is a very funny employ for ye, no doubt. For all that, if
7298𓀴ye have any affection for my neck (to say nothing of your own) ye will
7299𓀴perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly. I am going to
7300𓀴do a bit of play-acting, the bottom ground of which is just exactly as
7301𓀴serious as the gallows for the pair of us. So bear it, if ye please, in
7302𓀴mind, and conduct yourself according.”
7303𓀴
7304𓀴“Well, well,” said I, “have it as you will.”
7305𓀴
7306𓀴As we got near the clachan, he made me take his arm and hang upon it
7307𓀴like one almost helpless with weariness; and by the time he pushed
7308𓀴open the change-house door, he seemed to be half carrying me. The maid
7309𓀴appeared surprised (as well she might be) at our speedy return; but
7310𓀴Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation, helped me to a chair,
7311𓀴called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips,
7312𓀴and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like
7313𓀴a nursery-lass; the whole with that grave, concerned, affectionate
7314𓀴countenance, that might have imposed upon a judge. It was small wonder
7315𓀴if the maid were taken with the picture we presented, of a poor, sick,
7316𓀴overwrought lad and his most tender comrade. She drew quite near, and
7317𓀴stood leaning with her back on the next table.
7318𓀴
7319𓀴“What’s like wrong with him?” said she at last.
7320𓀴
7321𓀴Alan turned upon her, to my great wonder, with a kind of fury. “Wrong?”
7322𓀴 cries he. “He’s walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his
7323𓀴chin, and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets. Wrong, quo’ she!
7324𓀴Wrong enough, I would think! Wrong, indeed!” and he kept grumbling to
7325𓀴himself as he fed me, like a man ill-pleased.
7326𓀴
7327𓀴“He’s young for the like of that,” said the maid.
7328𓀴
7329𓀴“Ower young,” said Alan, with his back to her.
7330𓀴
7331𓀴“He would be better riding,” says she.
7332𓀴
7333𓀴“And where could I get a horse to him?” cried Alan, turning on her with
7334𓀴the same appearance of fury. “Would ye have me steal?”
7335𓀴
7336𓀴I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon, as indeed
7337𓀴it closed her mouth for the time. But my companion knew very well what
7338𓀴he was doing; and for as simple as he was in some things of life, had a
7339𓀴great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these.
7340𓀴
7341𓀴“Ye neednae tell me,” she said at last--“ye’re gentry.”
7342𓀴
7343𓀴“Well,” said Alan, softened a little (I believe against his will) by
7344𓀴this artless comment, “and suppose we were? Did ever you hear that
7345𓀴gentrice put money in folk’s pockets?”
7346𓀴
7347𓀴She sighed at this, as if she were herself some disinherited great lady.
7348𓀴“No,” says she, “that’s true indeed.”
7349𓀴
7350𓀴I was all this while chafing at the part I played, and sitting
7351𓀴tongue-tied between shame and merriment; but somehow at this I could
7352𓀴hold in no longer, and bade Alan let me be, for I was better already. My
7353𓀴voice stuck in my throat, for I ever hated to take part in lies; but my
7354𓀴very embarrassment helped on the plot, for the lass no doubt set down my
7355𓀴husky voice to sickness and fatigue.
7356𓀴
7357𓀴“Has he nae friends?” said she, in a tearful voice.
7358𓀴
7359𓀴“That has he so!” cried Alan, “if we could but win to them!--friends and
7360𓀴rich friends, beds to lie in, food to eat, doctors to see to him--and
7361𓀴here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a
7362𓀴beggarman.”
7363𓀴
7364𓀴“And why that?” says the lass.
7365𓀴
7366𓀴“My dear,” said Alan, “I cannae very safely say; but I’ll tell ye what
7367𓀴I’ll do instead,” says he, “I’ll whistle ye a bit tune.” And with that
7368𓀴he leaned pretty far over the table, and in a mere breath of a whistle,
7369𓀴but with a wonderful pretty sentiment, gave her a few bars of “Charlie
7370𓀴is my darling.”
7371𓀴
7372𓀴“Wheesht,” says she, and looked over her shoulder to the door.
7373𓀴
7374𓀴“That’s it,” said Alan.
7375𓀴
7376𓀴“And him so young!” cries the lass.
7377𓀴
7378𓀴“He’s old enough to----” and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part
7379𓀴of his neck, meaning that I was old enough to lose my head.
7380𓀴
7381𓀴“It would be a black shame,” she cried, flushing high.
7382𓀴
7383𓀴“It’s what will be, though,” said Alan, “unless we manage the better.”
7384𓀴
7385𓀴At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house, leaving
7386𓀴us alone together. Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his
7387𓀴schemes, and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated
7388𓀴like a child.
7389𓀴
7390𓀴“Alan,” I cried, “I can stand no more of this.”
7391𓀴
7392𓀴“Ye’ll have to sit it then, Davie,” said he. “For if ye upset the pot
7393𓀴now, ye may scrape your own life out of the fire, but Alan Breck is a
7394𓀴dead man.”
7395𓀴
7396𓀴This was so true that I could only groan; and even my groan served
7397𓀴Alan’s purpose, for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in
7398𓀴again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale.
7399𓀴
7400𓀴“Poor lamb!” says she, and had no sooner set the meat before us, than
7401𓀴she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch, as much as
7402𓀴to bid me cheer up. Then she told us to fall to, and there would be no
7403𓀴more to pay; for the inn was her own, or at least her father’s, and he
7404𓀴was gone for the day to Pittencrieff. We waited for no second bidding,
7405𓀴for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt
7406𓀴excellently well; and while we sat and ate, she took up that same place
7407𓀴by the next table, looking on, and thinking, and frowning to herself,
7408𓀴and drawing the string of her apron through her hand.
7409𓀴
7410𓀴“I’m thinking ye have rather a long tongue,” she said at last to Alan.
7411𓀴
7412𓀴“Ay” said Alan; “but ye see I ken the folk I speak to.”
7413𓀴
7414𓀴“I would never betray ye,” said she, “if ye mean that.”
7415𓀴
7416𓀴“No,” said he, “ye’re not that kind. But I’ll tell ye what ye would do,
7417𓀴ye would help.”
7418𓀴
7419𓀴“I couldnae,” said she, shaking her head. “Na, I couldnae.”
7420𓀴
7421𓀴“No,” said he, “but if ye could?”
7422𓀴
7423𓀴She answered him nothing.
7424𓀴
7425𓀴“Look here, my lass,” said Alan, “there are boats in the Kingdom of
7426𓀴Fife, for I saw two (no less) upon the beach, as I came in by your
7427𓀴town’s end. Now if we could have the use of a boat to pass under cloud
7428𓀴of night into Lothian, and some secret, decent kind of a man to bring
7429𓀴that boat back again and keep his counsel, there would be two souls
7430𓀴saved--mine to all likelihood--his to a dead surety. If we lack that
7431𓀴boat, we have but three shillings left in this wide world; and where
7432𓀴to go, and how to do, and what other place there is for us except the
7433𓀴chains of a gibbet--I give you my naked word, I kenna! Shall we go
7434𓀴wanting, lassie? Are ye to lie in your warm bed and think upon us, when
7435𓀴the wind gowls in the chimney and the rain tirls on the roof? Are ye to
7436𓀴eat your meat by the cheeks of a red fire, and think upon this poor sick
7437𓀴lad of mine, biting his finger ends on a blae muir for cauld and hunger?
7438𓀴Sick or sound, he must aye be moving; with the death grapple at his
7439𓀴throat he must aye be trailing in the rain on the lang roads; and when
7440𓀴he gants his last on a rickle of cauld stanes, there will be nae friends
7441𓀴near him but only me and God.”
7442𓀴
7443𓀴At this appeal, I could see the lass was in great trouble of mind,
7444𓀴being tempted to help us, and yet in some fear she might be helping
7445𓀴malefactors; and so now I determined to step in myself and to allay her
7446𓀴scruples with a portion of the truth.
7447𓀴
7448𓀴“Did ever you hear,” said I, “of Mr. Rankeillor of the Ferry?”
7449𓀴
7450𓀴“Rankeillor the writer?” said she. “I daur say that!”
7451𓀴
7452𓀴“Well,” said I, “it’s to his door that I am bound, so you may judge by
7453𓀴that if I am an ill-doer; and I will tell you more, that though I am
7454𓀴indeed, by a dreadful error, in some peril of my life, King George has
7455𓀴no truer friend in all Scotland than myself.”
7456𓀴
7457𓀴Her face cleared up mightily at this, although Alan’s darkened.
7458𓀴
7459𓀴“That’s more than I would ask,” said she. “Mr. Rankeillor is a kennt
7460𓀴man.” And she bade us finish our meat, get clear of the clachan as soon
7461𓀴as might be, and lie close in the bit wood on the sea-beach. “And ye can
7462𓀴trust me,” says she, “I’ll find some means to put you over.”
7463𓀴
7464𓀴At this we waited for no more, but shook hands with her upon the
7465𓀴bargain, made short work of the puddings, and set forth again from
7466𓀴Limekilns as far as to the wood. It was a small piece of perhaps a score
7467𓀴of elders and hawthorns and a few young ashes, not thick enough to veil
7468𓀴us from passersby upon the road or beach. Here we must lie, however,
7469𓀴making the best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had
7470𓀴of a deliverance, and planing more particularly what remained for us to
7471𓀴do.
7472𓀴
7473𓀴We had but one trouble all day; when a strolling piper came and sat in
7474𓀴the same wood with us; a red-nosed, bleareyed, drunken dog, with a great
7475𓀴bottle of whisky in his pocket, and a long story of wrongs that had been
7476𓀴done him by all sorts of persons, from the Lord President of the
7477𓀴Court of Session, who had denied him justice, down to the Bailies of
7478𓀴Inverkeithing who had given him more of it than he desired. It was
7479𓀴impossible but he should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all
7480𓀴day concealed in a thicket and having no business to allege. As long as
7481𓀴he stayed there he kept us in hot water with prying questions; and after
7482𓀴he was gone, as he was a man not very likely to hold his tongue, we were
7483𓀴in the greater impatience to be gone ourselves.
7484𓀴
7485𓀴The day came to an end with the same brightness; the night fell quiet
7486𓀴and clear; lights came out in houses and hamlets and then, one after
7487𓀴another, began to be put out; but it was past eleven, and we were long
7488𓀴since strangely tortured with anxieties, before we heard the grinding
7489𓀴of oars upon the rowing-pins. At that, we looked out and saw the lass
7490𓀴herself coming rowing to us in a boat. She had trusted no one with our
7491𓀴affairs, not even her sweetheart, if she had one; but as soon as her
7492𓀴father was asleep, had left the house by a window, stolen a neighbour’s
7493𓀴boat, and come to our assistance single-handed.
7494𓀴
7495𓀴I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks; but she was no less
7496𓀴abashed at the thought of hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to
7497𓀴hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was
7498𓀴in haste and silence; and so, what with one thing and another, she had
7499𓀴set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with
7500𓀴us, and was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns, before there was
7501𓀴one word said either of her service or our gratitude.
7502𓀴
7503𓀴Even after she was gone, we had nothing to say, as indeed nothing was
7504𓀴enough for such a kindness. Only Alan stood a great while upon the shore
7505𓀴shaking his head.
7506𓀴
7507𓀴“It is a very fine lass,” he said at last. “David, it is a very fine
7508𓀴lass.” And a matter of an hour later, as we were lying in a den on
7509𓀴the sea-shore and I had been already dozing, he broke out again in
7510𓀴commendations of her character. For my part, I could say nothing, she
7511𓀴was so simple a creature that my heart smote me both with remorse and
7512𓀴fear: remorse because we had traded upon her ignorance; and fear lest we
7513𓀴should have anyway involved her in the dangers of our situation.
7514𓀴

7518𓀴CHAPTER XXVII
7519𓀴
7520𓀴I COME TO MR. RANKEILLOR
7521𓀴
7522𓀴
7523𓀴The next day it was agreed that Alan should fend for himself till
7524𓀴sunset; but as soon as it began to grow dark, he should lie in the
7525𓀴fields by the roadside near to Newhalls, and stir for naught until he
7526𓀴heard me whistling. At first I proposed I should give him for a signal
7527𓀴the “Bonnie House of Airlie,” which was a favourite of mine; but he
7528𓀴objected that as the piece was very commonly known, any ploughman might
7529𓀴whistle it by accident; and taught me instead a little fragment of a
7530𓀴Highland air, which has run in my head from that day to this, and will
7531𓀴likely run in my head when I lie dying. Every time it comes to me, it
7532𓀴takes me off to that last day of my uncertainty, with Alan sitting up in
7533𓀴the bottom of the den, whistling and beating the measure with a finger,
7534𓀴and the grey of the dawn coming on his face.
7535𓀴
7536𓀴I was in the long street of Queensferry before the sun was up. It was a
7537𓀴fairly built burgh, the houses of good stone, many slated; the town-hall
7538𓀴not so fine, I thought, as that of Peebles, nor yet the street so noble;
7539𓀴but take it altogether, it put me to shame for my foul tatters.
7540𓀴
7541𓀴
7542𓀴
7543𓀴As the morning went on, and the fires began to be kindled, and the
7544𓀴windows to open, and the people to appear out of the houses, my concern
7545𓀴and despondency grew ever the blacker. I saw now that I had no grounds
7546𓀴to stand upon; and no clear proof of my rights, nor so much as of my own
7547𓀴identity. If it was all a bubble, I was indeed sorely cheated and left
7548𓀴in a sore pass. Even if things were as I conceived, it would in all
7549𓀴likelihood take time to establish my contentions; and what time had I
7550𓀴to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket, and a condemned,
7551𓀴hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country? Truly, if my hope
7552𓀴broke with me, it might come to the gallows yet for both of us. And as I
7553𓀴continued to walk up and down, and saw people looking askance at me upon
7554𓀴the street or out of windows, and nudging or speaking one to another
7555𓀴with smiles, I began to take a fresh apprehension: that it might be no
7556𓀴easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer, far less to convince
7557𓀴him of my story.
7558𓀴
7559𓀴For the life of me I could not muster up the courage to address any of
7560𓀴these reputable burghers; I thought shame even to speak with them in
7561𓀴such a pickle of rags and dirt; and if I had asked for the house of such
7562𓀴a man as Mr. Rankeillor, I suppose they would have burst out laughing in
7563𓀴my face. So I went up and down, and through the street, and down to
7564𓀴the harbour-side, like a dog that has lost its master, with a strange
7565𓀴gnawing in my inwards, and every now and then a movement of despair.
7566𓀴It grew to be high day at last, perhaps nine in the forenoon; and I was
7567𓀴worn with these wanderings, and chanced to have stopped in front of
7568𓀴a very good house on the landward side, a house with beautiful, clear
7569𓀴glass windows, flowering knots upon the sills, the walls new-harled[33] and
7570𓀴a chase-dog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home. Well,
7571𓀴I was even envying this dumb brute, when the door fell open and
7572𓀴there issued forth a shrewd, ruddy, kindly, consequential man in a
7573𓀴well-powdered wig and spectacles. I was in such a plight that no one set
7574𓀴eyes on me once, but he looked at me again; and this gentleman, as it
7575𓀴proved, was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight
7576𓀴up to me and asked me what I did.
7577𓀴
7578𓀴     [33] Newly rough-cast.
7579𓀴
7580𓀴I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business, and taking heart
7581𓀴of grace, asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor.
7582𓀴
7583𓀴“Why,” said he, “that is his house that I have just come out of; and for
7584𓀴a rather singular chance, I am that very man.”
7585𓀴
7586𓀴“Then, sir,” said I, “I have to beg the favour of an interview.”
7587𓀴
7588𓀴“I do not know your name,” said he, “nor yet your face.”
7589𓀴
7590𓀴“My name is David Balfour,” said I.
7591𓀴
7592𓀴“David Balfour?” he repeated, in rather a high tone, like one surprised.
7593𓀴“And where have you come from, Mr. David Balfour?” he asked, looking me
7594𓀴pretty drily in the face.
7595𓀴
7596𓀴“I have come from a great many strange places, sir,” said I; “but I
7597𓀴think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private
7598𓀴manner.”
7599𓀴
7600𓀴He seemed to muse awhile, holding his lip in his hand, and looking now
7601𓀴at me and now upon the causeway of the street.
7602𓀴
7603𓀴“Yes,” says he, “that will be the best, no doubt.” And he led me back
7604𓀴with him into his house, cried out to some one whom I could not see
7605𓀴that he would be engaged all morning, and brought me into a little
7606𓀴dusty chamber full of books and documents. Here he sate down, and bade
7607𓀴me be seated; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his
7608𓀴clean chair to my muddy rags. “And now,” says he, “if you have any
7609𓀴business, pray be brief and come swiftly to the point. _Nec gemino
7610𓀴bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo_--do you understand that?” says he, with
7611𓀴a keen look.
7612𓀴
7613𓀴“I will even do as Horace says, sir,” I answered, smiling, “and carry
7614𓀴you _in medias res_.” He nodded as if he was well pleased, and indeed
7615𓀴his scrap of Latin had been set to test me. For all that, and though I
7616𓀴was somewhat encouraged, the blood came in my face when I added: “I
7617𓀴have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws.”
7618𓀴
7619𓀴He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open. “Well?”
7620𓀴 said he.
7621𓀴
7622𓀴But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless.
7623𓀴
7624𓀴“Come, come, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “you must continue. Where were you
7625𓀴born?”
7626𓀴
7627𓀴“In Essendean, sir,” said I, “the year 1733, the 12th of March.”
7628𓀴
7629𓀴He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book; but what that
7630𓀴meant I knew not. “Your father and mother?” said he.
7631𓀴
7632𓀴“My father was Alexander Balfour, schoolmaster of that place,” said I,
7633𓀴“and my mother Grace Pitarrow; I think her people were from Angus.”
7634𓀴
7635𓀴“Have you any papers proving your identity?” asked Mr. Rankeillor.
7636𓀴
7637𓀴“No, sir,” said I, “but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell, the
7638𓀴minister, and could be readily produced. Mr. Campbell, too, would give
7639𓀴me his word; and for that matter, I do not think my uncle would deny
7640𓀴me.”
7641𓀴
7642𓀴“Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour?” says he.
7643𓀴
7644𓀴“The same,” said I.
7645𓀴
7646𓀴“Whom you have seen?” he asked.
7647𓀴
7648𓀴“By whom I was received into his own house,” I answered.
7649𓀴
7650𓀴“Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason?” asked Mr. Rankeillor.
7651𓀴
7652𓀴“I did so, sir, for my sins,” said I; “for it was by his means and the
7653𓀴procurement of my uncle, that I was kidnapped within sight of this town,
7654𓀴carried to sea, suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships, and
7655𓀴stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement.”
7656𓀴
7657𓀴“You say you were shipwrecked,” said Rankeillor; “where was that?”
7658𓀴
7659𓀴“Off the south end of the Isle of Mull,” said I. “The name of the isle
7660𓀴on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid.”
7661𓀴
7662𓀴“Ah!” says he, smiling, “you are deeper than me in the geography. But so
7663𓀴far, I may tell you, this agrees pretty exactly with other informations
7664𓀴that I hold. But you say you were kidnapped; in what sense?”
7665𓀴
7666𓀴“In the plain meaning of the word, sir,” said I. “I was on my way to
7667𓀴your house, when I was trepanned on board the brig, cruelly struck down,
7668𓀴thrown below, and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea. I
7669𓀴was destined for the plantations; a fate that, in God’s providence, I
7670𓀴have escaped.”
7671𓀴
7672𓀴“The brig was lost on June the 27th,” says he, looking in his book,
7673𓀴“and we are now at August the 24th. Here is a considerable hiatus, Mr.
7674𓀴Balfour, of near upon two months. It has already caused a vast amount
7675𓀴of trouble to your friends; and I own I shall not be very well contented
7676𓀴until it is set right.”
7677𓀴
7678𓀴“Indeed, sir,” said I, “these months are very easily filled up; but yet
7679𓀴before I told my story, I would be glad to know that I was talking to a
7680𓀴friend.”
7681𓀴
7682𓀴“This is to argue in a circle,” said the lawyer. “I cannot be convinced
7683𓀴till I have heard you. I cannot be your friend till I am properly
7684𓀴informed. If you were more trustful, it would better befit your time of
7685𓀴life. And you know, Mr. Balfour, we have a proverb in the country that
7686𓀴evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders.”
7687𓀴
7688𓀴“You are not to forget, sir,” said I, “that I have already suffered by
7689𓀴my trustfulness; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that
7690𓀴(if I rightly understand) is your employer?”
7691𓀴
7692𓀴All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor, and in
7693𓀴proportion as I gained ground, gaining confidence. But at this sally,
7694𓀴which I made with something of a smile myself, he fairly laughed aloud.
7695𓀴
7696𓀴“No, no,” said he, “it is not so bad as that. _Fui, non sum_. I was
7697𓀴indeed your uncle’s man of business; but while you (_imberbis juvenis
7698𓀴custode remoto_) were gallivanting in the west, a good deal of water
7699𓀴has run under the bridges; and if your ears did not sing, it was not
7700𓀴for lack of being talked about. On the very day of your sea disaster,
7701𓀴Mr. Campbell stalked into my office, demanding you from all the winds.
7702𓀴I had never heard of your existence; but I had known your father; and
7703𓀴from matters in my competence (to be touched upon hereafter) I was
7704𓀴disposed to fear the worst. Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you;
7705𓀴declared (what seemed improbable) that he had given you considerable
7706𓀴sums; and that you had started for the continent of Europe, intending
7707𓀴to fulfil your education, which was probable and praiseworthy.
7708𓀴Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell, he
7709𓀴deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past
7710𓀴life. Further interrogated where you now were, protested ignorance, but
7711𓀴believed you were in Leyden. That is a close sum of his replies. I am
7712𓀴not exactly sure that any one believed him,” continued Mr. Rankeillor
7713𓀴with a smile; “and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions
7714𓀴of mine that (in a word) he showed me to the door. We were then at a
7715𓀴full stand; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain, we had
7716𓀴no shadow of probation. In the very article, comes Captain Hoseason
7717𓀴with the story of your drowning; whereupon all fell through; with no
7718𓀴consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell, injury to my pocket, and
7719𓀴another blot upon your uncle’s character, which could very ill afford
7720𓀴it. And now, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “you understand the whole process
7721𓀴of these matters, and can judge for yourself to what extent I may be
7722𓀴trusted.”
7723𓀴
7724𓀴Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him, and placed more
7725𓀴scraps of Latin in his speech; but it was all uttered with a fine
7726𓀴geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust.
7727𓀴Moreover, I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a
7728𓀴doubt; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted.
7729𓀴
7730𓀴“Sir,” said I, “if I tell you my story, I must commit a friend’s life
7731𓀴to your discretion. Pass me your word it shall be sacred; and for what
7732𓀴touches myself, I will ask no better guarantee than just your face.”
7733𓀴
7734𓀴He passed me his word very seriously. “But,” said he, “these are rather
7735𓀴alarming prolocutions; and if there are in your story any little jostles
7736𓀴to the law, I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer, and pass
7737𓀴lightly.”
7738𓀴
7739𓀴Thereupon I told him my story from the first, he listening with his
7740𓀴spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed, so that I sometimes feared
7741𓀴he was asleep. But no such matter! he heard every word (as I found
7742𓀴afterward) with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as
7743𓀴often surprised me. Even strange outlandish Gaelic names, heard for that
7744𓀴time only, he remembered and would remind me of, years after. Yet when I
7745𓀴called Alan Breck in full, we had an odd scene. The name of Alan had of
7746𓀴course rung through Scotland, with the news of the Appin murder and the
7747𓀴offer of the reward; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer
7748𓀴moved in his seat and opened his eyes.
7749𓀴
7750𓀴“I would name no unnecessary names, Mr. Balfour,” said he; “above all of
7751𓀴Highlanders, many of whom are obnoxious to the law.”
7752𓀴
7753𓀴“Well, it might have been better not,” said I, “but since I have let it
7754𓀴slip, I may as well continue.”
7755𓀴
7756𓀴“Not at all,” said Mr. Rankeillor. “I am somewhat dull of hearing, as
7757𓀴you may have remarked; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly.
7758𓀴We will call your friend, if you please, Mr. Thomson--that there may
7759𓀴be no reflections. And in future, I would take some such way with any
7760𓀴Highlander that you may have to mention--dead or alive.”
7761𓀴
7762𓀴By this, I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly, and had
7763𓀴already guessed I might be coming to the murder. If he chose to play
7764𓀴this part of ignorance, it was no matter of mine; so I smiled, said it
7765𓀴was no very Highland-sounding name, and consented. Through all the rest
7766𓀴of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson; which amused me the more, as it was a
7767𓀴piece of policy after his own heart. James Stewart, in like manner,
7768𓀴was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson’s kinsman; Colin Campbell
7769𓀴passed as a Mr. Glen; and to Cluny, when I came to that part of my tale,
7770𓀴I gave the name of “Mr. Jameson, a Highland chief.” It was truly the
7771𓀴most open farce, and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it
7772𓀴up; but, after all, it was quite in the taste of that age, when there
7773𓀴were two parties in the state, and quiet persons, with no very high
7774𓀴opinions of their own, sought out every cranny to avoid offence to
7775𓀴either.
7776𓀴
7777𓀴“Well, well,” said the lawyer, when I had quite done, “this is a great
7778𓀴epic, a great Odyssey of yours. You must tell it, sir, in a sound
7779𓀴Latinity when your scholarship is riper; or in English if you please,
7780𓀴though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue. You have rolled much;
7781𓀴_quæ regio in terris_--what parish in Scotland (to make a homely
7782𓀴translation) has not been filled with your wanderings? You have shown,
7783𓀴besides, a singular aptitude for getting into false positions; and,
7784𓀴yes, upon the whole, for behaving well in them. This Mr. Thomson seems
7785𓀴to me a gentleman of some choice qualities, though perhaps a trifle
7786𓀴bloody-minded. It would please me none the worse, if (with all his
7787𓀴merits) he were soused in the North Sea, for the man, Mr. David, is a
7788𓀴sore embarrassment. But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him;
7789𓀴indubitably, he adhered to you. _It comes_--we may say--he was your
7790𓀴true companion; nor less _paribus curis vestigia figit_, for I dare say
7791𓀴you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows. Well, well, these
7792𓀴days are fortunately by; and I think (speaking humanly) that you are
7793𓀴near the end of your troubles.”
7794𓀴
7795𓀴As he thus moralised on my adventures, he looked upon me with so much
7796𓀴humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction. I had
7797𓀴been so long wandering with lawless people, and making my bed upon the
7798𓀴hills and under the bare sky, that to sit once more in a clean, covered
7799𓀴house, and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth, seemed
7800𓀴mighty elevations. Even as I thought so, my eye fell on my unseemly
7801𓀴tatters, and I was once more plunged in confusion. But the lawyer saw
7802𓀴and understood me. He rose, called over the stair to lay another plate,
7803𓀴for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner, and led me into a bedroom in the
7804𓀴upper part of the house. Here he set before me water and soap, and a
7805𓀴comb; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son; and here, with
7806𓀴another apposite tag, he left me to my toilet.
7807𓀴

7810𓀴
7811𓀴CHAPTER XXVIII
7812𓀴
7813𓀴I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE
7814𓀴
7815𓀴
7816𓀴Having made what change I could in my appearance; and blithe was I to look in
7817𓀴the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past, and David Balfour
7818𓀴come to life again. And yet I was ashamed of the change too, and, above
7819𓀴all, of the borrowed clothes. When I had done, Mr. Rankeillor caught
7820𓀴me on the stair, made me his compliments, and had me again into the
7821𓀴cabinet.
7822𓀴
7823𓀴“Sit ye down, Mr. David,” said he, “and now that you are looking a
7824𓀴little more like yourself, let me see if I can find you any news. You
7825𓀴will be wondering, no doubt, about your father and your uncle? To be
7826𓀴sure it is a singular tale; and the explanation is one that I blush to
7827𓀴have to offer you. For,” says he, really with embarrassment, “the matter
7828𓀴hinges on a love affair.”
7829𓀴
7830𓀴“Truly,” said I, “I cannot very well join that notion with my uncle.”
7831𓀴
7832𓀴“But your uncle, Mr. David, was not always old,” replied the lawyer,
7833𓀴“and what may perhaps surprise you more, not always ugly. He had a fine,
7834𓀴gallant air; people stood in their doors to look after him, as he
7835𓀴went by upon a mettle horse. I have seen it with these eyes, and I
7836𓀴ingenuously confess, not altogether without envy; for I was a plain lad
7837𓀴myself and a plain man’s son; and in those days it was a case of _Odi
7838𓀴te, qui bellus es, Sabelle_.”
7839𓀴
7840𓀴“It sounds like a dream,” said I.
7841𓀴
7842𓀴“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer, “that is how it is with youth and age. Nor
7843𓀴was that all, but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise
7844𓀴great things in the future. In 1715, what must he do but run away to
7845𓀴join the rebels? It was your father that pursued him, found him in a
7846𓀴ditch, and brought him back _multum gementem;_ to the mirth of the
7847𓀴whole country. However, _majora canamus_--the two lads fell in love,
7848𓀴and that with the same lady. Mr. Ebenezer, who was the admired and the
7849𓀴beloved, and the spoiled one, made, no doubt, mighty certain of the
7850𓀴victory; and when he found he had deceived himself, screamed like a
7851𓀴peacock. The whole country heard of it; now he lay sick at home, with
7852𓀴his silly family standing round the bed in tears; now he rode from
7853𓀴public-house to public-house, and shouted his sorrows into the lug of
7854𓀴Tom, Dick, and Harry. Your father, Mr. David, was a kind gentleman; but
7855𓀴he was weak, dolefully weak; took all this folly with a long
7856𓀴countenance; and one day--by your leave!--resigned the lady. She was no
7857𓀴such fool, however; it’s from her you must inherit your excellent good
7858𓀴sense; and she refused to be bandied from one to another. Both got upon
7859𓀴their knees to her; and the upshot of the matter for that while was
7860𓀴that she showed both of them the door. That was in August; dear me! the
7861𓀴same year I came from college. The scene must have been highly
7862𓀴farcical.”
7863𓀴
7864𓀴I thought myself it was a silly business, but I could not forget my
7865𓀴father had a hand in it. “Surely, sir, it had some note of tragedy,”
7866𓀴 said I.
7867𓀴
7868𓀴“Why, no, sir, not at all,” returned the lawyer. “For tragedy implies
7869𓀴some ponderable matter in dispute, some _dignus vindice nodus;_ and
7870𓀴this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had
7871𓀴been spoiled, and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly
7872𓀴belted. However, that was not your father’s view; and the end of it
7873𓀴was, that from concession to concession on your father’s part, and from
7874𓀴one height to another of squalling, sentimental selfishness upon your
7875𓀴uncle’s, they came at last to drive a sort of bargain, from whose ill
7876𓀴results you have recently been smarting. The one man took the lady, the
7877𓀴other the estate. Now, Mr. David, they talk a great deal of charity and
7878𓀴generosity; but in this disputable state of life, I often think the
7879𓀴happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his
7880𓀴lawyer, and takes all the law allows him. Anyhow, this piece of
7881𓀴Quixotry on your father’s part, as it was unjust in itself, has brought
7882𓀴forth a monstrous family of injustices. Your father and mother lived
7883𓀴and died poor folk; you were poorly reared; and in the meanwhile, what
7884𓀴a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws! And I might
7885𓀴add (if it was a matter I cared much about) what a time for Mr.
7886𓀴Ebenezer!”
7887𓀴
7888𓀴“And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all,” said I, “that a
7889𓀴man’s nature should thus change.”
7890𓀴
7891𓀴“True,” said Mr. Rankeillor. “And yet I imagine it was natural enough.
7892𓀴He could not think that he had played a handsome part. Those who knew
7893𓀴the story gave him the cold shoulder; those who knew it not, seeing one
7894𓀴brother disappear, and the other succeed in the estate, raised a cry of
7895𓀴murder; so that upon all sides he found himself evited. Money was all
7896𓀴he got by his bargain; well, he came to think the more of money. He was
7897𓀴selfish when he was young, he is selfish now that he is old; and the
7898𓀴latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen
7899𓀴for yourself.”
7900𓀴
7901𓀴“Well, sir,” said I, “and in all this, what is my position?”
7902𓀴
7903𓀴“The estate is yours beyond a doubt,” replied the lawyer. “It matters
7904𓀴nothing what your father signed, you are the heir of entail. But your
7905𓀴uncle is a man to fight the indefensible; and it would be likely your
7906𓀴identity that he would call in question. A lawsuit is always expensive,
7907𓀴and a family lawsuit always scandalous; besides which, if any of your
7908𓀴doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out, we might find that
7909𓀴we had burned our fingers. The kidnapping, to be sure, would be a court
7910𓀴card upon our side, if we could only prove it. But it may be difficult
7911𓀴to prove; and my advice (upon the whole) is to make a very easy bargain
7912𓀴with your uncle, perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has
7913𓀴taken root for a quarter of a century, and contenting yourself in the
7914𓀴meanwhile with a fair provision.”
7915𓀴
7916𓀴I told him I was very willing to be easy, and that to carry family
7917𓀴concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much
7918𓀴averse. In the meantime (thinking to myself) I began to see the outlines
7919𓀴of that scheme on which we afterwards acted.
7920𓀴
7921𓀴“The great affair,” I asked, “is to bring home to him the kidnapping?”
7922𓀴
7923𓀴“Surely,” said Mr. Rankeillor, “and if possible, out of court. For mark
7924𓀴you here, Mr. David: we could no doubt find some men of the _Covenant_
7925𓀴who would swear to your reclusion; but once they were in the box, we
7926𓀴could no longer check their testimony, and some word of your friend Mr.
7927𓀴Thomson must certainly crop out. Which (from what you have let fall) I
7928𓀴cannot think to be desirable.”
7929𓀴
7930𓀴“Well, sir,” said I, “here is my way of it.” And I opened my plot to
7931𓀴him.
7932𓀴
7933𓀴“But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson?” says he,
7934𓀴when I had done.
7935𓀴
7936𓀴“I think so, indeed, sir,” said I.
7937𓀴
7938𓀴“Dear doctor!” cries he, rubbing his brow. “Dear doctor! No, Mr. David,
7939𓀴I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible. I say nothing against your
7940𓀴friend, Mr. Thomson: I know nothing against him; and if I did--mark
7941𓀴this, Mr. David!--it would be my duty to lay hands on him. Now I put it
7942𓀴to you: is it wise to meet? He may have matters to his charge. He may
7943𓀴not have told you all. His name may not be even Thomson!” cries the
7944𓀴lawyer, twinkling; “for some of these fellows will pick up names by the
7945𓀴roadside as another would gather haws.”
7946𓀴
7947𓀴“You must be the judge, sir,” said I.
7948𓀴
7949𓀴But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy, for he kept
7950𓀴musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs.
7951𓀴Rankeillor; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a
7952𓀴bottle of wine, ere he was back harping on my proposal. When and where
7953𓀴was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson; was I sure of Mr. T.’s discretion;
7954𓀴supposing we could catch the old fox tripping, would I consent to such
7955𓀴and such a term of an agreement--these and the like questions he kept
7956𓀴asking at long intervals, while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his
7957𓀴tongue. When I had answered all of them, seemingly to his contentment,
7958𓀴he fell into a still deeper muse, even the claret being now forgotten.
7959𓀴Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil, and set to work writing and
7960𓀴weighing every word; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into
7961𓀴the chamber.
7962𓀴
7963𓀴“Torrance,” said he, “I must have this written out fair against
7964𓀴to-night; and when it is done, you will be so kind as put on your hat
7965𓀴and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me, for you will
7966𓀴probably be wanted as a witness.”
7967𓀴
7968𓀴“What, sir,” cried I, as soon as the clerk was gone, “are you to venture
7969𓀴it?”
7970𓀴
7971𓀴“Why, so it would appear,” says he, filling his glass. “But let us speak
7972𓀴no more of business. The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a
7973𓀴little droll matter of some years ago, when I had made a tryst with the
7974𓀴poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh. Each had gone his proper errand; and
7975𓀴when it came four o’clock, Torrance had been taking a glass and did
7976𓀴not know his master, and I, who had forgot my spectacles, was so blind
7977𓀴without them, that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk.” And
7978𓀴thereupon he laughed heartily.
7979𓀴
7980𓀴I said it was an odd chance, and smiled out of politeness; but what held
7981𓀴me all the afternoon in wonder, he kept returning and dwelling on this
7982𓀴story, and telling it again with fresh details and laughter; so that I
7983𓀴began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my
7984𓀴friend’s folly.
7985𓀴
7986𓀴Towards the time I had appointed with Alan, we set out from the house,
7987𓀴Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm, and Torrance following behind with the
7988𓀴deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand. All through the
7989𓀴town, the lawyer was bowing right and left, and continually being
7990𓀴button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business; and I
7991𓀴could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county. At last we were
7992𓀴clear of the houses, and began to go along the side of the haven and
7993𓀴towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier, the scene of my misfortune. I
7994𓀴could not look upon the place without emotion, recalling how many that
7995𓀴had been there with me that day were now no more: Ransome taken, I could
7996𓀴hope, from the evil to come; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him;
7997𓀴and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge.
7998𓀴All these, and the brig herself, I had outlived; and come through these
7999𓀴hardships and fearful perils without scath. My only thought should have
8000𓀴been of gratitude; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow
8001𓀴for others and a chill of recollected fear.
8002𓀴
8003𓀴I was so thinking when, upon a sudden, Mr. Rankeillor cried out, clapped
8004𓀴his hand to his pockets, and began to laugh.
8005𓀴
8006𓀴“Why,” he cries, “if this be not a farcical adventure! After all that I
8007𓀴said, I have forgot my glasses!”
8008𓀴
8009𓀴At that, of course, I understood the purpose of his anecdote, and knew
8010𓀴that if he had left his spectacles at home, it had been done on purpose,
8011𓀴so that he might have the benefit of Alan’s help without the awkwardness
8012𓀴of recognising him. And indeed it was well thought upon; for now
8013𓀴(suppose things to go the very worst) how could Rankeillor swear to
8014𓀴my friend’s identity, or how be made to bear damaging evidence against
8015𓀴myself? For all that, he had been a long while of finding out his want,
8016𓀴and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through
8017𓀴the town; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well.
8018𓀴
8019𓀴As soon as we were past the Hawes (where I recognised the landlord
8020𓀴smoking his pipe in the door, and was amazed to see him look no older)
8021𓀴Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march, walking behind with Torrance
8022𓀴and sending me forward in the manner of a scout. I went up the hill,
8023𓀴whistling from time to time my Gaelic air; and at length I had the
8024𓀴pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush. He
8025𓀴was somewhat dashed in spirits, having passed a long day alone skulking
8026𓀴in the county, and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas. But
8027𓀴at the mere sight of my clothes, he began to brighten up; and as soon as
8028𓀴I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I
8029𓀴looked to him to play in what remained, he sprang into a new man.
8030𓀴
8031𓀴“And that is a very good notion of yours,” says he; “and I dare to say
8032𓀴that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than
8033𓀴Alan Breck. It is not a thing (mark ye) that any one could do, but takes
8034𓀴a gentleman of penetration. But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man
8035𓀴will be somewhat wearying to see me,” says Alan.
8036𓀴
8037𓀴Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor, who came up alone and
8038𓀴was presented to my friend, Mr. Thomson.
8039𓀴
8040𓀴“Mr. Thomson, I am pleased to meet you,” said he. “But I have forgotten
8041𓀴my glasses; and our friend, Mr. David here” (clapping me on the
8042𓀴shoulder), “will tell you that I am little better than blind, and that
8043𓀴you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow.”
8044𓀴
8045𓀴This he said, thinking that Alan would be pleased; but the Highlandman’s
8046𓀴vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that.
8047𓀴
8048𓀴“Why, sir,” says he, stiffly, “I would say it mattered the less as we
8049𓀴are met here for a particular end, to see justice done to Mr. Balfour;
8050𓀴and by what I can see, not very likely to have much else in common. But
8051𓀴I accept your apology, which was a very proper one to make.”
8052𓀴
8053𓀴“And that is more than I could look for, Mr. Thomson,” said Rankeillor,
8054𓀴heartily. “And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise,
8055𓀴I think we should come into a nice agreement; to which end, I propose
8056𓀴that you should lend me your arm, for (what with the dusk and the want
8057𓀴of my glasses) I am not very clear as to the path; and as for you, Mr.
8058𓀴David, you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with.
8059𓀴Only let me remind you, it’s quite needless he should hear more of your
8060𓀴adventures or those of--ahem--Mr. Thomson.”
8061𓀴
8062𓀴Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk, and Torrance and
8063𓀴I brought up the rear.
8064𓀴
8065𓀴Night was quite come when we came in view of the house of Shaws. Ten
8066𓀴had been gone some time; it was dark and mild, with a pleasant, rustling
8067𓀴wind in the south-west that covered the sound of our approach; and as we
8068𓀴drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building. It
8069𓀴seemed my uncle was already in bed, which was indeed the best thing for
8070𓀴our arrangements. We made our last whispered consultations some fifty
8071𓀴yards away; and then the lawyer and Torrance and I crept quietly up and
8072𓀴crouched down beside the corner of the house; and as soon as we were
8073𓀴in our places, Alan strode to the door without concealment and began to
8074𓀴knock.

8078𓀴
8079𓀴CHAPTER XXIX
8080𓀴
8081𓀴I COME INTO MY KINGDOM
8082𓀴
8083𓀴
8084𓀴For some time Alan volleyed upon the door, and his knocking only roused
8085𓀴the echoes of the house and neighbourhood. At last, however, I could
8086𓀴hear the noise of a window gently thrust up, and knew that my uncle
8087𓀴had come to his observatory. By what light there was, he would see Alan
8088𓀴standing, like a dark shadow, on the steps; the three witnesses were
8089𓀴hidden quite out of his view; so that there was nothing to alarm an
8090𓀴honest man in his own house. For all that, he studied his visitor awhile
8091𓀴in silence, and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving.
8092𓀴
8093𓀴“What’s this?” says he. “This is nae kind of time of night for decent
8094𓀴folk; and I hae nae trokings[34] wi’ night-hawks. What brings ye here? I
8095𓀴have a blunderbush.”
8096𓀴
8097𓀴     [34] Dealings.
8098𓀴
8099𓀴“Is that yoursel’, Mr. Balfour?” returned Alan, stepping back and
8100𓀴looking up into the darkness. “Have a care of that blunderbuss; they’re
8101𓀴nasty things to burst.”
8102𓀴
8103𓀴“What brings ye here? and whae are ye?” says my uncle, angrily.
8104𓀴
8105𓀴“I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the
8106𓀴country-side,” said Alan; “but what brings me here is another story,
8107𓀴being more of your affair than mine; and if ye’re sure it’s what ye
8108𓀴would like, I’ll set it to a tune and sing it to you.”
8109𓀴
8110𓀴“And what is’t?” asked my uncle.
8111𓀴
8112𓀴“David,” says Alan.
8113𓀴
8114𓀴“What was that?” cried my uncle, in a mighty changed voice.
8115𓀴
8116𓀴“Shall I give ye the rest of the name, then?” said Alan.
8117𓀴
8118𓀴There was a pause; and then, “I’m thinking I’ll better let ye in,” says
8119𓀴my uncle, doubtfully.
8120𓀴
8121𓀴“I dare say that,” said Alan; “but the point is, Would I go? Now I will
8122𓀴tell you what I am thinking. I am thinking that it is here upon this
8123𓀴doorstep that we must confer upon this business; and it shall be here or
8124𓀴nowhere at all whatever; for I would have you to understand that I am as
8125𓀴stiffnecked as yoursel’, and a gentleman of better family.”
8126𓀴
8127𓀴This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer; he was a little while
8128𓀴digesting it, and then says he, “Weel, weel, what must be must,” and
8129𓀴shut the window. But it took him a long time to get down-stairs, and a
8130𓀴still longer to undo the fastenings, repenting (I dare say) and taken
8131𓀴with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar. At
8132𓀴last, however, we heard the creak of the hinges, and it seems my uncle
8133𓀴slipped gingerly out and (seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or
8134𓀴two) sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his
8135𓀴hands.
8136𓀴
8137𓀴“And, now” says he, “mind I have my blunderbush, and if ye take a step
8138𓀴nearer ye’re as good as deid.”
8139𓀴
8140𓀴“And a very civil speech,” says Alan, “to be sure.”
8141𓀴
8142𓀴“Na,” says my uncle, “but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding,
8143𓀴and I’m bound to be prepared. And now that we understand each other,
8144𓀴ye’ll can name your business.”
8145𓀴
8146𓀴“Why,” says Alan, “you that are a man of so much understanding, will
8147𓀴doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman. My name has nae
8148𓀴business in my story; but the county of my friends is no very far from
8149𓀴the Isle of Mull, of which ye will have heard. It seems there was a
8150𓀴ship lost in those parts; and the next day a gentleman of my family was
8151𓀴seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands, when he came upon a lad
8152𓀴that was half drowned. Well, he brought him to; and he and some other
8153𓀴gentleman took and clapped him in an auld, ruined castle, where from
8154𓀴that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends. My friends
8155𓀴are a wee wild-like, and not so particular about the law as some that
8156𓀴I could name; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk, and was
8157𓀴your born nephew, Mr. Balfour, they asked me to give ye a bit call and
8158𓀴confer upon the matter. And I may tell ye at the off-go, unless we can
8159𓀴agree upon some terms, ye are little likely to set eyes upon him. For my
8160𓀴friends,” added Alan, simply, “are no very well off.”
8161𓀴
8162𓀴My uncle cleared his throat. “I’m no very caring,” says he. “He wasnae a
8163𓀴good lad at the best of it, and I’ve nae call to interfere.”
8164𓀴
8165𓀴“Ay, ay,” said Alan, “I see what ye would be at: pretending ye don’t
8166𓀴care, to make the ransom smaller.”
8167𓀴
8168𓀴“Na,” said my uncle, “it’s the mere truth. I take nae manner of interest
8169𓀴in the lad, and I’ll pay nae ransome, and ye can make a kirk and a mill
8170𓀴of him for what I care.”
8171𓀴
8172𓀴“Hoot, sir,” says Alan. “Blood’s thicker than water, in the deil’s name!
8173𓀴Ye cannae desert your brother’s son for the fair shame of it; and if
8174𓀴ye did, and it came to be kennt, ye wouldnae be very popular in your
8175𓀴country-side, or I’m the more deceived.”
8176𓀴
8177𓀴“I’m no just very popular the way it is,” returned Ebenezer; “and I
8178𓀴dinnae see how it would come to be kennt. No by me, onyway; nor yet by
8179𓀴you or your friends. So that’s idle talk, my buckie,” says he.
8180𓀴
8181𓀴“Then it’ll have to be David that tells it,” said Alan.
8182𓀴
8183𓀴“How that?” says my uncle, sharply.
8184𓀴
8185𓀴“Ou, just this way,” says Alan. “My friends would doubtless keep your
8186𓀴nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it,
8187𓀴but if there was nane, I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang
8188𓀴where he pleased, and be damned to him!”
8189𓀴
8190𓀴“Ay, but I’m no very caring about that either,” said my uncle. “I
8191𓀴wouldnae be muckle made up with that.”
8192𓀴
8193𓀴“I was thinking that,” said Alan.
8194𓀴
8195𓀴“And what for why?” asked Ebenezer.
8196𓀴
8197𓀴“Why, Mr. Balfour,” replied Alan, “by all that I could hear, there were
8198𓀴two ways of it: either ye liked David and would pay to get him back; or
8199𓀴else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him, and would pay for us
8200𓀴to keep him. It seems it’s not the first; well then, it’s the second;
8201𓀴and blythe am I to ken it, for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket
8202𓀴and the pockets of my friends.”
8203𓀴
8204𓀴“I dinnae follow ye there,” said my uncle.
8205𓀴
8206𓀴“No?” said Alan. “Well, see here: you dinnae want the lad back; well,
8207𓀴what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?”
8208𓀴
8209𓀴My uncle made no answer, but shifted uneasily on his seat.
8210𓀴
8211𓀴“Come, sir,” cried Alan. “I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman;
8212𓀴I bear a king’s name; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall
8213𓀴door. Either give me an answer in civility, and that out of hand; or by
8214𓀴the top of Glencoe, I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals.”
8215𓀴
8216𓀴“Eh, man,” cried my uncle, scrambling to his feet, “give me a meenit!
8217𓀴What’s like wrong with ye? I’m just a plain man and nae dancing master;
8218𓀴and I’m tryin to be as ceevil as it’s morally possible. As for that wild
8219𓀴talk, it’s fair disrepitable. Vitals, says you! And where would I be
8220𓀴with my blunderbush?” he snarled.
8221𓀴
8222𓀴“Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against
8223𓀴the bright steel in the hands of Alan,” said the other. “Before your
8224𓀴jottering finger could find the trigger, the hilt would dirl on your
8225𓀴breast-bane.”
8226𓀴
8227𓀴“Eh, man, whae’s denying it?” said my uncle. “Pit it as ye please, hae’t
8228𓀴your ain way; I’ll do naething to cross ye. Just tell me what like ye’ll
8229𓀴be wanting, and ye’ll see that we’ll can agree fine.”
8230𓀴
8231𓀴“Troth, sir,” said Alan, “I ask for nothing but plain dealing. In two
8232𓀴words: do ye want the lad killed or kept?”
8233𓀴
8234𓀴“O, sirs!” cried Ebenezer. “O, sirs, me! that’s no kind of language!”
8235𓀴
8236𓀴“Killed or kept!” repeated Alan.
8237𓀴
8238𓀴“O, keepit, keepit!” wailed my uncle. “We’ll have nae bloodshed, if you
8239𓀴please.”
8240𓀴
8241𓀴“Well,” says Alan, “as ye please; that’ll be the dearer.”
8242𓀴
8243𓀴“The dearer?” cries Ebenezer. “Would ye fyle your hands wi’ crime?”
8244𓀴
8245𓀴“Hoot!” said Alan, “they’re baith crime, whatever! And the killing’s
8246𓀴easier, and quicker, and surer. Keeping the lad’ll be a fashious[35] job, a
8247𓀴fashious, kittle business.”
8248𓀴
8249𓀴     [35] Troublesome.
8250𓀴
8251𓀴“I’ll have him keepit, though,” returned my uncle. “I never had naething
8252𓀴to do with onything morally wrong; and I’m no gaun to begin to pleasure
8253𓀴a wild Hielandman.”
8254𓀴
8255𓀴“Ye’re unco scrupulous,” sneered Alan.
8256𓀴
8257𓀴“I’m a man o’ principle,” said Ebenezer, simply; “and if I have to pay
8258𓀴for it, I’ll have to pay for it. And besides,” says he, “ye forget the
8259𓀴lad’s my brother’s son.”
8260𓀴
8261𓀴“Well, well,” said Alan, “and now about the price. It’s no very easy for
8262𓀴me to set a name upon it; I would first have to ken some small matters.
8263𓀴I would have to ken, for instance, what ye gave Hoseason at the first
8264𓀴off-go?”
8265𓀴
8266𓀴“Hoseason!” cries my uncle, struck aback. “What for?”
8267𓀴
8268𓀴“For kidnapping David,” says Alan.
8269𓀴
8270𓀴“It’s a lee, it’s a black lee!” cried my uncle. “He was never kidnapped.
8271𓀴He leed in his throat that tauld ye that. Kidnapped? He never was!”
8272𓀴
8273𓀴“That’s no fault of mine nor yet of yours,” said Alan; “nor yet of
8274𓀴Hoseason’s, if he’s a man that can be trusted.”
8275𓀴
8276𓀴“What do ye mean?” cried Ebenezer. “Did Hoseason tell ye?”
8277𓀴
8278𓀴“Why, ye donnered auld runt, how else would I ken?” cried Alan.
8279𓀴“Hoseason and me are partners; we gang shares; so ye can see for
8280𓀴yoursel’ what good ye can do leeing. And I must plainly say ye drove a
8281𓀴fool’s bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in
8282𓀴your private matters. But that’s past praying for; and ye must lie on
8283𓀴your bed the way ye made it. And the point in hand is just this: what
8284𓀴did ye pay him?”
8285𓀴
8286𓀴“Has he tauld ye himsel’?” asked my uncle.
8287𓀴
8288𓀴“That’s my concern,” said Alan.
8289𓀴
8290𓀴“Weel,” said my uncle, “I dinnae care what he said, he leed, and the
8291𓀴solemn God’s truth is this, that I gave him twenty pound. But I’ll be
8292𓀴perfec’ly honest with ye: forby that, he was to have the selling of the
8293𓀴lad in Caroliny, whilk would be as muckle mair, but no from my pocket,
8294𓀴ye see.”
8295𓀴
8296𓀴“Thank you, Mr. Thomson. That will do excellently well,” said the
8297𓀴lawyer, stepping forward; and then mighty civilly, “Good-evening, Mr.
8298𓀴Balfour,” said he.
8299𓀴
8300𓀴And, “Good-evening, Uncle Ebenezer,” said I.
8301𓀴
8302𓀴And, “It’s a braw nicht, Mr. Balfour,” added Torrance.
8303𓀴
8304𓀴Never a word said my uncle, neither black nor white; but just sat where
8305𓀴he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to
8306𓀴stone. Alan filched away his blunderbuss; and the lawyer, taking him
8307𓀴by the arm, plucked him up from the doorstep, led him into the kitchen,
8308𓀴whither we all followed, and set him down in a chair beside the hearth,
8309𓀴where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning.
8310𓀴
8311𓀴There we all looked upon him for a while, exulting greatly in our
8312𓀴success, but yet with a sort of pity for the man’s shame.
8313𓀴
8314𓀴“Come, come, Mr. Ebenezer,” said the lawyer, “you must not be
8315𓀴down-hearted, for I promise you we shall make easy terms. In the
8316𓀴meanwhile give us the cellar key, and Torrance shall draw us a bottle
8317𓀴of your father’s wine in honour of the event.” Then, turning to me and
8318𓀴taking me by the hand, “Mr. David,” says he, “I wish you all joy in your
8319𓀴good fortune, which I believe to be deserved.” And then to Alan, with
8320𓀴a spice of drollery, “Mr. Thomson, I pay you my compliment; it was
8321𓀴most artfully conducted; but in one point you somewhat outran my
8322𓀴comprehension. Do I understand your name to be James? or Charles? or is
8323𓀴it George, perhaps?”
8324𓀴
8325𓀴“And why should it be any of the three, sir?” quoth Alan, drawing
8326𓀴himself up, like one who smelt an offence.
8327𓀴
8328𓀴“Only, sir, that you mentioned a king’s name,” replied Rankeillor; “and
8329𓀴as there has never yet been a King Thomson, or his fame at least has
8330𓀴never come my way, I judged you must refer to that you had in baptism.”
8331𓀴
8332𓀴This was just the stab that Alan would feel keenest, and I am free to
8333𓀴confess he took it very ill. Not a word would he answer, but stepped off
8334𓀴to the far end of the kitchen, and sat down and sulked; and it was not
8335𓀴till I stepped after him, and gave him my hand, and thanked him by title
8336𓀴as the chief spring of my success, that he began to smile a bit, and was
8337𓀴at last prevailed upon to join our party.
8338𓀴
8339𓀴By that time we had the fire lighted, and a bottle of wine uncorked; a
8340𓀴good supper came out of the basket, to which Torrance and I and Alan
8341𓀴set ourselves down; while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next
8342𓀴chamber to consult. They stayed there closeted about an hour; at the end
8343𓀴of which period they had come to a good understanding, and my uncle and
8344𓀴I set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner. By the terms
8345𓀴of this, my uncle bound himself to satisfy Rankeillor as to his
8346𓀴intromissions, and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of
8347𓀴Shaws.
8348𓀴
8349𓀴So the beggar in the ballad had come home; and when I lay down that
8350𓀴night on the kitchen chests, I was a man of means and had a name in the
8351𓀴country. Alan and Torrance and Rankeillor slept and snored on their hard
8352𓀴beds; but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones,
8353𓀴so many days and nights, and often with an empty belly, and in fear
8354𓀴of death, this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the
8355𓀴former evil ones; and I lay till dawn, looking at the fire on the roof
8356𓀴and planning the future.
8357𓀴
8358𓀴
8359𓀴
8360𓀴
8361𓀴CHAPTER XXX
8362𓀴
8363𓀴GOOD-BYE
8364𓀴
8365𓀴
8366𓀴So far as I was concerned myself, I had come to port; but I had still
8367𓀴Alan, to whom I was so much beholden, on my hands; and I felt besides a
8368𓀴heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens. On both
8369𓀴these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning, walking to and
8370𓀴fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws, and with nothing
8371𓀴in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors’ and were
8372𓀴now mine. Even as I spoke on these grave subjects, my eye would take a
8373𓀴glad bit of a run over the prospect, and my heart jump with pride.
8374𓀴
8375𓀴About my clear duty to my friend, the lawyer had no doubt. I must help
8376𓀴him out of the county at whatever risk; but in the case of James, he was
8377𓀴of a different mind.
8378𓀴
8379𓀴“Mr. Thomson,” says he, “is one thing, Mr. Thomson’s kinsman quite
8380𓀴another. I know little of the facts, but I gather that a great noble
8381𓀴(whom we will call, if you like, the D. of A.)[36] has some concern and
8382𓀴is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter. The D. of A. is
8383𓀴doubtless an excellent nobleman; but, Mr. David, _timeo qui nocuere
8384𓀴deos_. If you interfere to balk his vengeance, you should remember
8385𓀴there is one way to shut your testimony out; and that is to put you in
8386𓀴the dock. There, you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson’s
8387𓀴kinsman. You will object that you are innocent; well, but so is he. And
8388𓀴to be tried for your life before a Highland jury, on a Highland quarrel
8389𓀴and with a Highland Judge upon the bench, would be a brief transition
8390𓀴to the gallows.”
8391𓀴
8392𓀴     [36] The Duke of Argyle.
8393𓀴
8394𓀴Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply
8395𓀴to them; so I put on all the simplicity I could. “In that case, sir,”
8396𓀴 said I, “I would just have to be hanged--would I not?”
8397𓀴
8398𓀴“My dear boy,” cries he, “go in God’s name, and do what you think is
8399𓀴right. It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising
8400𓀴you to choose the safe and shameful; and I take it back with an apology.
8401𓀴Go and do your duty; and be hanged, if you must, like a gentleman. There
8402𓀴are worse things in the world than to be hanged.”
8403𓀴
8404𓀴“Not many, sir,” said I, smiling.
8405𓀴
8406𓀴“Why, yes, sir,” he cried, “very many. And it would be ten times better
8407𓀴for your uncle (to go no farther afield) if he were dangling decently
8408𓀴upon a gibbet.”
8409𓀴
8410𓀴Thereupon he turned into the house (still in a great fervour of mind,
8411𓀴so that I saw I had pleased him heartily) and there he wrote me two
8412𓀴letters, making his comments on them as he wrote.
8413𓀴
8414𓀴“This,” says he, “is to my bankers, the British Linen Company, placing a
8415𓀴credit to your name. Consult Mr. Thomson, he will know of ways; and
8416𓀴you, with this credit, can supply the means. I trust you will be a good
8417𓀴husband of your money; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson,
8418𓀴I would be even prodigal. Then for his kinsman, there is no better way
8419𓀴than that you should seek the Advocate, tell him your tale, and offer
8420𓀴testimony; whether he may take it or not, is quite another matter, and
8421𓀴will turn on the D. of A. Now, that you may reach the Lord Advocate well
8422𓀴recommended, I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own, the
8423𓀴learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, a man whom I esteem. It will look better
8424𓀴that you should be presented by one of your own name; and the laird of
8425𓀴Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord
8426𓀴Advocate Grant. I would not trouble him, if I were you, with any
8427𓀴particulars; and (do you know?) I think it would be needless to refer to
8428𓀴Mr. Thomson. Form yourself upon the laird, he is a good model; when you
8429𓀴deal with the Advocate, be discreet; and in all these matters, may the
8430𓀴Lord guide you, Mr. David!”
8431𓀴
8432𓀴Thereupon he took his farewell, and set out with Torrance for the Ferry,
8433𓀴while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh. As we went
8434𓀴by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge, we
8435𓀴kept looking back at the house of my fathers. It stood there, bare and
8436𓀴great and smokeless, like a place not lived in; only in one of the top
8437𓀴windows, there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back
8438𓀴and forward, like the head of a rabbit from a burrow. I had little
8439𓀴welcome when I came, and less kindness while I stayed; but at least I
8440𓀴was watched as I went away.
8441𓀴
8442𓀴Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way, having little heart either
8443𓀴to walk or speak. The same thought was uppermost in both, that we were
8444𓀴near the time of our parting; and remembrance of all the bygone days
8445𓀴sate upon us sorely. We talked indeed of what should be done; and it
8446𓀴was resolved that Alan should keep to the county, biding now here, now
8447𓀴there, but coming once in the day to a particular place where I might be
8448𓀴able to communicate with him, either in my own person or by messenger.
8449𓀴In the meanwhile, I was to seek out a lawyer, who was an Appin Stewart,
8450𓀴and a man therefore to be wholly trusted; and it should be his part to
8451𓀴find a ship and to arrange for Alan’s safe embarkation. No sooner was
8452𓀴this business done, than the words seemed to leave us; and though I
8453𓀴would seek to jest with Alan under the name of Mr. Thomson, and he with
8454𓀴me on my new clothes and my estate, you could feel very well that we
8455𓀴were nearer tears than laughter.
8456𓀴
8457𓀴We came the by-way over the hill of Corstorphine; and when we got
8458𓀴near to the place called Rest-and-be-Thankful, and looked down on
8459𓀴Corstorphine bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill, we
8460𓀴both stopped, for we both knew without a word said that we had come to
8461𓀴where our ways parted. Here he repeated to me once again what had been
8462𓀴agreed upon between us: the address of the lawyer, the daily hour at
8463𓀴which Alan might be found, and the signals that were to be made by any
8464𓀴that came seeking him. Then I gave what money I had (a guinea or two of
8465𓀴Rankeillor’s) so that he should not starve in the meanwhile; and then we
8466𓀴stood a space, and looked over at Edinburgh in silence.
8467𓀴
8468𓀴“Well, good-bye,” said Alan, and held out his left hand.
8469𓀴
8470𓀴“Good-bye,” said I, and gave the hand a little grasp, and went off down
8471𓀴hill.
8472𓀴
8473𓀴Neither one of us looked the other in the face, nor so long as he was in
8474𓀴my view did I take one back glance at the friend I was leaving. But as
8475𓀴I went on my way to the city, I felt so lost and lonesome, that I could
8476𓀴have found it in my heart to sit down by the dyke, and cry and weep like
8477𓀴any baby.
8478𓀴
8479𓀴It was coming near noon when I passed in by the West Kirk and the
8480𓀴Grassmarket into the streets of the capital. The huge height of the
8481𓀴buildings, running up to ten and fifteen storeys, the narrow arched
8482𓀴entries that continually vomited passengers, the wares of the merchants
8483𓀴in their windows, the hubbub and endless stir, the foul smells and the
8484𓀴fine clothes, and a hundred other particulars too small to mention,
8485𓀴struck me into a kind of stupor of surprise, so that I let the crowd
8486𓀴carry me to and fro; and yet all the time what I was thinking of was
8487𓀴Alan at Rest-and-be-Thankful; and all the time (although you would think
8488𓀴I would not choose but be delighted with these braws and novelties)
8489𓀴there was a cold gnawing in my inside like a remorse for something
8490𓀴wrong.
8491𓀴
8492𓀴The hand of Providence brought me in my drifting to the very doors of
8493𓀴the British Linen Company’s bank.

8553𓀴used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
8554𓀴agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
8555𓀴things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
8556𓀴even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
8557𓀴paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

8560𓀴electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

8562𓀴1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

8564𓀴of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
8565𓀴works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
8566𓀴States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
8567𓀴United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
8568𓀴claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
8569𓀴displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
8570𓀴all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
8571𓀴that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
8572𓀴free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
8573𓀴works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
8574𓀴Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
8575𓀴comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
8576𓀴same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
8577𓀴you share it without charge with others.
8578𓀴
8579𓀴1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
8580𓀴what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
8581𓀴in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
8582𓀴check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
8583𓀴agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
8584𓀴distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
8585𓀴other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

8595𓀴phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
8596𓀴performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

8620𓀴additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

8639𓀴other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official

8650𓀴
8651𓀴1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
8652𓀴access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

8654𓀴
8655𓀴    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
8656𓀴        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
8657𓀴        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
8658𓀴        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
8659𓀴        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
8660𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
8661𓀴        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
8662𓀴        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
8663𓀴        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
8664𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
8665𓀴        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
8666𓀴        Literary Archive Foundation.”
8667𓀴
8668𓀴    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

8670𓀴        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
8671𓀴        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
8672𓀴        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
8673𓀴        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
8674𓀴        works.
8675𓀴
8676𓀴    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
8677𓀴        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
8678𓀴        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

8692𓀴1.F.
8693𓀴
8694𓀴1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
8695𓀴effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
8696𓀴works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
8697𓀴Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
8698𓀴electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
8699𓀴contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
8700𓀴or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
8701𓀴intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
8702𓀴other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
8703𓀴cannot be read by your equipment.
8704𓀴
8705𓀴1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right

8711𓀴fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
8712𓀴LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
8713𓀴PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
8714𓀴TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
8715𓀴LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
8716𓀴INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
8717𓀴DAMAGE.
8718𓀴
8719𓀴1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
8720𓀴defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
8721𓀴receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
8722𓀴written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
8723𓀴received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
8724𓀴with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
8725𓀴with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
8726𓀴lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
8727𓀴or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
8728𓀴opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
8729𓀴the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
8730𓀴without further opportunities to fix the problem.
8731𓀴
8732𓀴1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

8737𓀴1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
8738𓀴warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
8739𓀴damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
8740𓀴violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
8741𓀴agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
8742𓀴limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
8743𓀴unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
8744𓀴remaining provisions.
8745𓀴
8746𓀴1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
8747𓀴trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
8748𓀴providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
8749𓀴accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
8750𓀴production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
8751𓀴electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
8752𓀴including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
8753𓀴the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
8754𓀴or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
8755𓀴additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
8756𓀴Defect you cause.

8758𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
8759𓀴
8760𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
8761𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
8762𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
8763𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
8764𓀴from people in all walks of life.
8765𓀴
8766𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
8767𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
8768𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
8769𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
8770𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
8771𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
8772𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
8773𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
8774𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

8776𓀴Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
8777𓀴
8778𓀴The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit

8791𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
8792𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
8793𓀴
8794𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
8795𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
8796𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
8797𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
8798𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
8799𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
8800𓀴status with the IRS.
8801𓀴
8802𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
8803𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
8804𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
8805𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
8806𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
8807𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
8808𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
8809𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
8810𓀴
8811𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
8812𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
8813𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
8814𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
8815𓀴
8816𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
8817𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
8818𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
8819𓀴
8820𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
8821𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
8822𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
8823𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

8825𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
8826𓀴
8827𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
8828𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
8829𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
8830𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
8831𓀴volunteer support.
8832𓀴
8833𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
8834𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
8835𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
8836𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
8837𓀴edition.
8838𓀴
8839𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
8840𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
8841𓀴
8842𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
8843𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
8844𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
8845𓀴subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
