50𓀴I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
51𓀴
52𓀴
53𓀴I.
54𓀴
55𓀴To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
56𓀴mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
57𓀴predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
58𓀴akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
59𓀴were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
60𓀴was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
61𓀴the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
62𓀴false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
63𓀴and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
64𓀴drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
65𓀴reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
66𓀴adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
67𓀴throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
68𓀴instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
69𓀴be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
70𓀴yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
71𓀴Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
72𓀴
73𓀴I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
74𓀴from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
75𓀴interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
76𓀴of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
77𓀴while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian
78𓀴soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
79𓀴books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
80𓀴the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
81𓀴nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
82𓀴and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
83𓀴observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
84𓀴mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
85𓀴From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
86𓀴summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
87𓀴of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
88𓀴finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
89𓀴successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
90𓀴his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
91𓀴the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
92𓀴
93𓀴One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a
94𓀴journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
95𓀴my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
96𓀴door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
97𓀴with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
98𓀴keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
99𓀴extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
100𓀴looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
101𓀴against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
102𓀴head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
103𓀴knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
104𓀴story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created
105𓀴dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell
106𓀴and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
107𓀴
108𓀴His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
109𓀴to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
110𓀴me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
111𓀴spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire
112𓀴and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
113𓀴
114𓀴“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put
115𓀴on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”
116𓀴
117𓀴“Seven!” I answered.
118𓀴
119𓀴“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
120𓀴fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
121𓀴that you intended to go into harness.”
122𓀴
123𓀴“Then, how do you know?”
124𓀴
125𓀴“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
126𓀴yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
127𓀴servant girl?”
128𓀴
129𓀴“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have
130𓀴been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a
131𓀴country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
132𓀴have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
133𓀴Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
134𓀴again, I fail to see how you work it out.”
135𓀴
136𓀴He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
137𓀴
138𓀴“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside
139𓀴of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
140𓀴scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by
141𓀴someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
142𓀴order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
143𓀴deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
144𓀴particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
145𓀴to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
146𓀴iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
147𓀴forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
148𓀴he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
149𓀴pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”
150𓀴
151𓀴I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
152𓀴process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,
153𓀴“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
154𓀴could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
155𓀴reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I
156𓀴believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”
157𓀴
158𓀴“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
159𓀴down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The
160𓀴distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
161𓀴which lead up from the hall to this room.”
162𓀴
163𓀴“Frequently.”
164𓀴
165𓀴“How often?”
166𓀴
167𓀴“Well, some hundreds of times.”
168𓀴
169𓀴“Then how many are there?”
170𓀴
171𓀴“How many? I don’t know.”
172𓀴
173𓀴“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
174𓀴my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
175𓀴both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
176𓀴little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
177𓀴of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw
178𓀴over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
179𓀴upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”
180𓀴
181𓀴The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
182𓀴
183𓀴“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it
184𓀴said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
185𓀴deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of
186𓀴Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
187𓀴matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
188𓀴This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
189𓀴chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
190𓀴wear a mask.”
191𓀴
192𓀴“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it
193𓀴means?”
194𓀴
195𓀴“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
196𓀴data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
197𓀴theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
198𓀴it?”
199𓀴
200𓀴I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
201𓀴written.
202𓀴
203𓀴“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,
204𓀴endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not
205𓀴be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
206𓀴stiff.”
207𓀴
208𓀴“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English
209𓀴paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”
210𓀴
211𓀴I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”
212𓀴with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.
213𓀴
214𓀴“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.
215𓀴
216𓀴“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”
217𓀴
218𓀴“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’
219𓀴which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
220𓀴our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us
221𓀴glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume
222𓀴from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a
223𓀴German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable
224𓀴as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
225𓀴glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
226𓀴that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
227𓀴from his cigarette.
228𓀴
229𓀴“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.
230𓀴
231𓀴“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
232𓀴peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from
233𓀴all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written
234𓀴that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only
235𓀴remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who
236𓀴writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
237𓀴face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
238𓀴doubts.”
239𓀴
240𓀴As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating
241𓀴wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes
242𓀴whistled.
243𓀴
244𓀴“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of
245𓀴the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
246𓀴and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there
247𓀴is nothing else.”
248𓀴
249𓀴“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”
250𓀴
251𓀴“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
252𓀴And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”
253𓀴
254𓀴“But your client—”
255𓀴
256𓀴“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
257𓀴Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”
258𓀴
259𓀴A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
260𓀴passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
261𓀴authoritative tap.
262𓀴
263𓀴“Come in!” said Holmes.
264𓀴
265𓀴A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
266𓀴in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
267𓀴with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
268𓀴taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
269𓀴fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
270𓀴thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
271𓀴secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
272𓀴beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
273𓀴trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
274𓀴barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
275𓀴carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
276𓀴part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
277𓀴mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
278𓀴was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
279𓀴he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
280𓀴and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
281𓀴of obstinacy.
282𓀴
283𓀴“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
284𓀴marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from
285𓀴one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
286𓀴
287𓀴“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
288𓀴Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
289𓀴have I the honour to address?”
290𓀴
291𓀴“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I
292𓀴understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
293𓀴discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
294𓀴importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
295𓀴alone.”
296𓀴
297𓀴I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
298𓀴my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this
299𓀴gentleman anything which you may say to me.”
300𓀴
301𓀴The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,
302𓀴“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
303𓀴that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
304𓀴much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
305𓀴European history.”
306𓀴
307𓀴“I promise,” said Holmes.
308𓀴
309𓀴“And I.”
310𓀴
311𓀴“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august
312𓀴person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
313𓀴confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
314𓀴not exactly my own.”
315𓀴
316𓀴“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.
317𓀴
318𓀴“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
319𓀴be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
320𓀴seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
321𓀴plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
322𓀴kings of Bohemia.”
323𓀴
324𓀴“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in
325𓀴his armchair and closing his eyes.
326𓀴
327𓀴Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
328𓀴lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
329𓀴most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes
330𓀴slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
331𓀴
332𓀴“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I
333𓀴should be better able to advise you.”
334𓀴
335𓀴The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
336𓀴uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
337𓀴the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”
338𓀴he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”
339𓀴
340𓀴“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I
341𓀴was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
342𓀴Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
343𓀴Bohemia.”
344𓀴
345𓀴“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once
346𓀴more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can
347𓀴understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
348𓀴person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
349𓀴an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_
350𓀴from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”
351𓀴
352𓀴“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
353𓀴
354𓀴“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
355𓀴visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
356𓀴Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”
357𓀴
358𓀴“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without
359𓀴opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
360𓀴all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
361𓀴name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
362𓀴information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
363𓀴that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
364𓀴monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
365𓀴
366𓀴“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
367𓀴Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!
368𓀴Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your
369𓀴Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,
370𓀴wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
371𓀴those letters back.”
372𓀴
373𓀴“Precisely so. But how—”
374𓀴
375𓀴“Was there a secret marriage?”
376𓀴
377𓀴“None.”
378𓀴
379𓀴“No legal papers or certificates?”
380𓀴
381𓀴“None.”
382𓀴
383𓀴“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
384𓀴produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
385𓀴prove their authenticity?”
386𓀴
387𓀴“There is the writing.”
388𓀴
389𓀴“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”
390𓀴
391𓀴“My private note-paper.”
392𓀴
393𓀴“Stolen.”
394𓀴
395𓀴“My own seal.”
396𓀴
397𓀴“Imitated.”
398𓀴
399𓀴“My photograph.”
400𓀴
401𓀴“Bought.”
402𓀴
403𓀴“We were both in the photograph.”
404𓀴
405𓀴“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
406𓀴indiscretion.”
407𓀴
408𓀴“I was mad—insane.”
409𓀴
410𓀴“You have compromised yourself seriously.”
411𓀴
412𓀴“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”
413𓀴
414𓀴“It must be recovered.”
415𓀴
416𓀴“We have tried and failed.”
417𓀴
418𓀴“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”
419𓀴
420𓀴“She will not sell.”
421𓀴
422𓀴“Stolen, then.”
423𓀴
424𓀴“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
425𓀴house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
426𓀴been waylaid. There has been no result.”
427𓀴
428𓀴“No sign of it?”
429𓀴
430𓀴“Absolutely none.”
431𓀴
432𓀴Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.
433𓀴
434𓀴“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.
435𓀴
436𓀴“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”
437𓀴
438𓀴“To ruin me.”
439𓀴
440𓀴“But how?”
441𓀴
442𓀴“I am about to be married.”
443𓀴
444𓀴“So I have heard.”
445𓀴
446𓀴“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of
447𓀴Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
448𓀴herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
449𓀴would bring the matter to an end.”
450𓀴
451𓀴“And Irene Adler?”
452𓀴
453𓀴“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
454𓀴she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
455𓀴has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
456𓀴resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no
457𓀴lengths to which she would not go—none.”
458𓀴
459𓀴“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”
460𓀴
461𓀴“I am sure.”
462𓀴
463𓀴“And why?”
464𓀴
465𓀴“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
466𓀴betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”
467𓀴
468𓀴“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is
469𓀴very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
470𓀴just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the
471𓀴present?”
472𓀴
473𓀴“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count
474𓀴Von Kramm.”
475𓀴
476𓀴“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”
477𓀴
478𓀴“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”
479𓀴
480𓀴“Then, as to money?”
481𓀴
482𓀴“You have _carte blanche_.”
483𓀴
484𓀴“Absolutely?”
485𓀴
486𓀴“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
487𓀴have that photograph.”
488𓀴
489𓀴“And for present expenses?”
490𓀴
491𓀴The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
492𓀴it on the table.
493𓀴
494𓀴“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he
495𓀴said.
496𓀴
497𓀴Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
498𓀴to him.
499𓀴
500𓀴“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.
501𓀴
502𓀴“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”
503𓀴
504𓀴Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the
505𓀴photograph a cabinet?”
506𓀴
507𓀴“It was.”
508𓀴
509𓀴“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have
510𓀴some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the
511𓀴wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be
512𓀴good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like
513𓀴to chat this little matter over with you.”
514𓀴
515𓀴
516𓀴II.
517𓀴
518𓀴At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not
519𓀴yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
520𓀴shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,
521𓀴however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
522𓀴I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
523𓀴surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
524𓀴associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,
525𓀴the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a
526𓀴character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
527𓀴investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
528𓀴masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
529𓀴made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
530𓀴quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
531𓀴mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very
532𓀴possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
533𓀴
534𓀴It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
535𓀴groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
536𓀴disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my
537𓀴friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three
538𓀴times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he
539𓀴vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
540𓀴tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
541𓀴pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
542𓀴heartily for some minutes.
543𓀴
544𓀴“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he
545𓀴was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
546𓀴
547𓀴“What is it?”
548𓀴
549𓀴“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
550𓀴my morning, or what I ended by doing.”
551𓀴
552𓀴“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
553𓀴perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”
554𓀴
555𓀴“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
556𓀴I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the
557𓀴character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and
558𓀴freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all
559𓀴that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_
560𓀴villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
561𓀴the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
562𓀴the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
563𓀴and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
564𓀴open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
565𓀴could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and
566𓀴examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
567𓀴anything else of interest.
568𓀴
569𓀴“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there
570𓀴was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent
571𓀴the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
572𓀴exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
573𓀴and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say
574𓀴nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was
575𓀴not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
576𓀴listen to.”
577𓀴
578𓀴“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.
579𓀴
580𓀴“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the
581𓀴daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
582𓀴Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
583𓀴out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom
584𓀴goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male
585𓀴visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,
586𓀴never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey
587𓀴Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
588𓀴confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
589𓀴and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I
590𓀴began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think
591𓀴over my plan of campaign.
592𓀴
593𓀴“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
594𓀴He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between
595𓀴them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
596𓀴his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably
597𓀴transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less
598𓀴likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should
599𓀴continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
600𓀴gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
601𓀴widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
602𓀴details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
603𓀴to understand the situation.”
604𓀴
605𓀴“I am following you closely,” I answered.
606𓀴
607𓀴“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up
608𓀴to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
609𓀴handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom
610𓀴I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman
611𓀴to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
612𓀴a man who was thoroughly at home.
613𓀴
614𓀴“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of
615𓀴him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking
616𓀴excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently
617𓀴he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to
618𓀴the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
619𓀴earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &
620𓀴Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the
621𓀴Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’
622𓀴
623𓀴“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
624𓀴to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
625𓀴with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
626𓀴the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t
627𓀴pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
628𓀴caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
629𓀴a face that a man might die for.
630𓀴
631𓀴“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if
632𓀴you reach it in twenty minutes.’
633𓀴
634𓀴“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether
635𓀴I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a
636𓀴cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby
637𓀴fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.
638𓀴Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
639𓀴minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
640𓀴clear enough what was in the wind.
641𓀴
642𓀴“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others
643𓀴were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
644𓀴were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
645𓀴into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
646𓀴followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
647𓀴them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
648𓀴lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
649𓀴church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
650𓀴me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
651𓀴
652𓀴“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’
653𓀴
654𓀴“‘What then?’ I asked.
655𓀴
656𓀴“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’
657𓀴
658𓀴“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I
659𓀴found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
660𓀴vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in
661𓀴the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,
662𓀴bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
663𓀴thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
664𓀴clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position
665𓀴in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
666𓀴that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some
667𓀴informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
668𓀴to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
669𓀴appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
670𓀴streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I
671𓀴mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”
672𓀴
673𓀴“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”
674𓀴
675𓀴“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the
676𓀴pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
677𓀴and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they
678𓀴separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I
679𓀴shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left
680𓀴him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I
681𓀴went off to make my own arrangements.”
682𓀴
683𓀴“Which are?”
684𓀴
685𓀴“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I
686𓀴have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
687𓀴this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”
688𓀴
689𓀴“I shall be delighted.”
690𓀴
691𓀴“You don’t mind breaking the law?”
692𓀴
693𓀴“Not in the least.”
694𓀴
695𓀴“Nor running a chance of arrest?”
696𓀴
697𓀴“Not in a good cause.”
698𓀴
699𓀴“Oh, the cause is excellent!”
700𓀴
701𓀴“Then I am your man.”
702𓀴
703𓀴“I was sure that I might rely on you.”
704𓀴
705𓀴“But what is it you wish?”
706𓀴
707𓀴“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
708𓀴Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
709𓀴landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
710𓀴much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene
711𓀴of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
712𓀴seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”
713𓀴
714𓀴“And what then?”
715𓀴
716𓀴“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
717𓀴There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,
718𓀴come what may. You understand?”
719𓀴
720𓀴“I am to be neutral?”
721𓀴
722𓀴“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
723𓀴unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
724𓀴into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
725𓀴will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”
726𓀴
727𓀴“Yes.”
728𓀴
729𓀴“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”
730𓀴
731𓀴“Yes.”
732𓀴
733𓀴“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give
734𓀴you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
735𓀴quite follow me?”
736𓀴
737𓀴“Entirely.”
738𓀴
739𓀴“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
740𓀴roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted
741𓀴with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is
742𓀴confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up
743𓀴by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the
744𓀴street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made
745𓀴myself clear?”
746𓀴
747𓀴“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
748𓀴the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
749𓀴to wait you at the corner of the street.”
750𓀴
751𓀴“Precisely.”
752𓀴
753𓀴“Then you may entirely rely on me.”
754𓀴
755𓀴“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare
756𓀴for the new role I have to play.”
757𓀴
758𓀴He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
759𓀴character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His
760𓀴broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
761𓀴smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
762𓀴as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that
763𓀴Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul
764𓀴seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
765𓀴fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
766𓀴specialist in crime.
767𓀴
768𓀴It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
769𓀴wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
770𓀴Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
771𓀴we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
772𓀴of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
773𓀴Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be
774𓀴less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a
775𓀴quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of
776𓀴shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
777𓀴scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
778𓀴nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
779𓀴down with cigars in their mouths.
780𓀴
781𓀴“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the
782𓀴house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes
783𓀴a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
784𓀴to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming
785𓀴to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find
786𓀴the photograph?”
787𓀴
788𓀴“Where, indeed?”
789𓀴
790𓀴“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet
791𓀴size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows
792𓀴that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two
793𓀴attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that
794𓀴she does not carry it about with her.”
795𓀴
796𓀴“Where, then?”
797𓀴
798𓀴“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
799𓀴inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like
800𓀴to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
801𓀴She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what
802𓀴indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
803𓀴business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
804𓀴a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be
805𓀴in her own house.”
806𓀴
807𓀴“But it has twice been burgled.”
808𓀴
809𓀴“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”
810𓀴
811𓀴“But how will you look?”
812𓀴
813𓀴“I will not look.”
814𓀴
815𓀴“What then?”
816𓀴
817𓀴“I will get her to show me.”
818𓀴
819𓀴“But she will refuse.”
820𓀴
821𓀴“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
822𓀴carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”
823𓀴
824𓀴As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the
825𓀴curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
826𓀴the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
827𓀴the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
828𓀴copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
829𓀴the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
830𓀴the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
831𓀴scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was
832𓀴struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
833𓀴was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
834𓀴struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
835𓀴dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,
836𓀴he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
837𓀴down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
838𓀴direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
839𓀴dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
840𓀴crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene
841𓀴Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she
842𓀴stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
843𓀴the hall, looking back into the street.
844𓀴
845𓀴“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.
846𓀴
847𓀴“He is dead,” cried several voices.
848𓀴
849𓀴“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone
850𓀴before you can get him to hospital.”
851𓀴
852𓀴“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s
853𓀴purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a
854𓀴rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”
855𓀴
856𓀴“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”
857𓀴
858𓀴“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.
859𓀴This way, please!”
860𓀴
861𓀴Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
862𓀴principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by
863𓀴the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
864𓀴so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know
865𓀴whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he
866𓀴was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
867𓀴myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I
868𓀴was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
869𓀴the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes
870𓀴to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened
871𓀴my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I
872𓀴thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from
873𓀴injuring another.
874𓀴
875𓀴Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
876𓀴is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
877𓀴the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my
878𓀴rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out
879𓀴of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
880𓀴ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of
881𓀴“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the
882𓀴open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
883𓀴the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false
884𓀴alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
885𓀴of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm
886𓀴in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly
887𓀴and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the
888𓀴quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
889𓀴
890𓀴“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been
891𓀴better. It is all right.”
892𓀴
893𓀴“You have the photograph?”
894𓀴
895𓀴“I know where it is.”
896𓀴
897𓀴“And how did you find out?”
898𓀴
899𓀴“She showed me, as I told you she would.”
900𓀴
901𓀴“I am still in the dark.”
902𓀴
903𓀴“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was
904𓀴perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
905𓀴an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”
906𓀴
907𓀴“I guessed as much.”
908𓀴
909𓀴“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
910𓀴palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
911𓀴face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”
912𓀴
913𓀴“That also I could fathom.”
914𓀴
915𓀴“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could
916𓀴she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I
917𓀴suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to
918𓀴see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were
919𓀴compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”
920𓀴
921𓀴“How did that help you?”
922𓀴
923𓀴“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
924𓀴her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It
925𓀴is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
926𓀴advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it
927𓀴was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married
928𓀴woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
929𓀴Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
930𓀴more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to
931𓀴secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting
932𓀴were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
933𓀴photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
934𓀴bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as
935𓀴she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
936𓀴replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
937𓀴not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
938𓀴house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;
939𓀴but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
940𓀴seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”
941𓀴
942𓀴“And now?” I asked.
943𓀴
944𓀴“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
945𓀴to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown
946𓀴into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
947𓀴when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
948𓀴a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”
949𓀴
950𓀴“And when will you call?”
951𓀴
952𓀴“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
953𓀴clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
954𓀴complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without
955𓀴delay.”
956𓀴
957𓀴We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
958𓀴searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
959𓀴
960𓀴“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”
961𓀴
962𓀴There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
963𓀴appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
964𓀴
965𓀴“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit
966𓀴street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”
967𓀴
968𓀴
969𓀴III.
970𓀴
971𓀴I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
972𓀴and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the
973𓀴room.
974𓀴
975𓀴“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either
976𓀴shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
977𓀴
978𓀴“Not yet.”
979𓀴
980𓀴“But you have hopes?”
981𓀴
982𓀴“I have hopes.”
983𓀴
984𓀴“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”
985𓀴
986𓀴“We must have a cab.”
987𓀴
988𓀴“No, my brougham is waiting.”
989𓀴
990𓀴“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once
991𓀴more for Briony Lodge.
992𓀴
993𓀴“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.
994𓀴
995𓀴“Married! When?”
996𓀴
997𓀴“Yesterday.”
998𓀴
999𓀴“But to whom?”
1000𓀴
1001𓀴“To an English lawyer named Norton.”
1002𓀴
1003𓀴“But she could not love him.”
1004𓀴
1005𓀴“I am in hopes that she does.”
1006𓀴
1007𓀴“And why in hopes?”
1008𓀴
1009𓀴“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If
1010𓀴the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does
1011𓀴not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with
1012𓀴your Majesty’s plan.”
1013𓀴
1014𓀴“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
1015𓀴What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,
1016𓀴which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
1017𓀴
1018𓀴The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the
1019𓀴steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
1020𓀴brougham.
1021𓀴
1022𓀴“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.
1023𓀴
1024𓀴“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a
1025𓀴questioning and rather startled gaze.
1026𓀴
1027𓀴“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left
1028𓀴this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for
1029𓀴the Continent.”
1030𓀴
1031𓀴“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
1032𓀴surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”
1033𓀴
1034𓀴“Never to return.”
1035𓀴
1036𓀴“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”
1037𓀴
1038𓀴“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
1039𓀴drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
1040𓀴scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
1041𓀴drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
1042𓀴Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
1043𓀴plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The
1044𓀴photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was
1045𓀴superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My
1046𓀴friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at
1047𓀴midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
1048𓀴
1049𓀴    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took
1050𓀴    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
1051𓀴    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
1052𓀴    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
1053𓀴    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly
1054𓀴    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you
1055𓀴    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
1056𓀴    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old
1057𓀴    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
1058𓀴    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the
1059𓀴    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
1060𓀴    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came
1061𓀴    down just as you departed.
1062𓀴
1063𓀴    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
1064𓀴    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
1065𓀴    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
1066𓀴    the Temple to see my husband.
1067𓀴
1068𓀴    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
1069𓀴    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
1070𓀴    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
1071𓀴    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do
1072𓀴    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
1073𓀴    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
1074𓀴    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
1075𓀴    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
1076𓀴    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
1077𓀴
1078𓀴
1079𓀴    “Very truly yours,
1080𓀴
1081𓀴    “IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”
1082𓀴
1083𓀴
1084𓀴“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had
1085𓀴all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute
1086𓀴she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity
1087𓀴that she was not on my level?”
1088𓀴
1089𓀴“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very
1090𓀴different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that
1091𓀴I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more
1092𓀴successful conclusion.”
1093𓀴
1094𓀴“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more
1095𓀴successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
1096𓀴safe as if it were in the fire.”
1097𓀴
1098𓀴“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”
1099𓀴
1100𓀴“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward
1101𓀴you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
1102𓀴held it out upon the palm of his hand.
1103𓀴
1104𓀴“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”
1105𓀴said Holmes.
1106𓀴
1107𓀴“You have but to name it.”
1108𓀴
1109𓀴“This photograph!”
1110𓀴
1111𓀴The King stared at him in amazement.
1112𓀴
1113𓀴“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”
1114𓀴
1115𓀴“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
1116𓀴I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and,
1117𓀴turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched
1118𓀴out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
1119𓀴
1120𓀴And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
1121𓀴Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a
1122𓀴woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I
1123𓀴have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or
1124𓀴when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable
1125𓀴title of _the_ woman.
1126𓀴
1127𓀴
1128𓀴
1129𓀴
1130𓀴II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
1131𓀴
1132𓀴
1133𓀴 I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
1134𓀴 autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
1135𓀴 stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an
1136𓀴 apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled
1137𓀴 me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
1138𓀴
1139𓀴“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he
1140𓀴said cordially.
1141𓀴
1142𓀴“I was afraid that you were engaged.”
1143𓀴
1144𓀴“So I am. Very much so.”
1145𓀴
1146𓀴“Then I can wait in the next room.”
1147𓀴
1148𓀴“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper
1149𓀴in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will
1150𓀴be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”
1151𓀴
1152𓀴The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
1153𓀴greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
1154𓀴fat-encircled eyes.
1155𓀴
1156𓀴“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting
1157𓀴his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I
1158𓀴know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and
1159𓀴outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have
1160𓀴shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to
1161𓀴chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish
1162𓀴so many of my own little adventures.”
1163𓀴
1164𓀴“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I
1165𓀴observed.
1166𓀴
1167𓀴“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went
1168𓀴into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that
1169𓀴for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life
1170𓀴itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the
1171𓀴imagination.”
1172𓀴
1173𓀴“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”
1174𓀴
1175𓀴“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for
1176𓀴otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your
1177𓀴reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.
1178𓀴Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,
1179𓀴and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular
1180𓀴which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that
1181𓀴the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with
1182𓀴the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where
1183𓀴there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.
1184𓀴As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the
1185𓀴present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events
1186𓀴is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
1187𓀴Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence
1188𓀴your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has
1189𓀴not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the
1190𓀴story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As
1191𓀴a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of
1192𓀴events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar
1193𓀴cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to
1194𓀴admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”
1195𓀴
1196𓀴The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
1197𓀴little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside
1198𓀴pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,
1199𓀴with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,
1200𓀴I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my
1201𓀴companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his
1202𓀴dress or appearance.
1203𓀴
1204𓀴I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore
1205𓀴every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,
1206𓀴pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers,
1207𓀴a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab
1208𓀴waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of
1209𓀴metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown
1210𓀴overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
1211𓀴Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man
1212𓀴save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
1213𓀴discontent upon his features.
1214𓀴
1215𓀴Sherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head
1216𓀴with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious
1217𓀴facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,
1218𓀴that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done
1219𓀴a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”
1220𓀴
1221𓀴Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the
1222𓀴paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
1223𓀴
1224𓀴“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”
1225𓀴he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.
1226𓀴It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”
1227𓀴
1228𓀴“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than
1229𓀴your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
1230𓀴developed.”
1231𓀴
1232𓀴“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”
1233𓀴
1234𓀴“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
1235𓀴especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use
1236𓀴an arc-and-compass breastpin.”
1237𓀴
1238𓀴“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”
1239𓀴
1240𓀴“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five
1241𓀴inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you
1242𓀴rest it upon the desk?”
1243𓀴
1244𓀴“Well, but China?”
1245𓀴
1246𓀴“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist
1247𓀴could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo
1248𓀴marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That
1249𓀴trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite
1250𓀴peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from
1251𓀴your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”
1252𓀴
1253𓀴Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought
1254𓀴at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was
1255𓀴nothing in it after all.”
1256𓀴
1257𓀴“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in
1258𓀴explaining. ‘_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,’ you know, and my poor
1259𓀴little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so
1260𓀴candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”
1261𓀴
1262𓀴“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted
1263𓀴halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You
1264𓀴just read it for yourself, sir.”
1265𓀴
1266𓀴I took the paper from him and read as follows:
1267𓀴
1268𓀴“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
1269𓀴Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another
1270𓀴vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a
1271𓀴week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in
1272𓀴body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.
1273𓀴Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the
1274𓀴offices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”
1275𓀴
1276𓀴
1277𓀴“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read
1278𓀴over the extraordinary announcement.
1279𓀴
1280𓀴Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
1281𓀴high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he.
1282𓀴“And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about
1283𓀴yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had
1284𓀴upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper
1285𓀴and the date.”
1286𓀴
1287𓀴“It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”
1288𓀴
1289𓀴“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”
1290𓀴
1291𓀴“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”
1292𓀴said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s
1293𓀴business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair,
1294𓀴and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I
1295𓀴used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I
1296𓀴would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half
1297𓀴wages so as to learn the business.”
1298𓀴
1299𓀴“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.
1300𓀴
1301𓀴“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s
1302𓀴hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;
1303𓀴and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I
1304𓀴am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I
1305𓀴put ideas in his head?”
1306𓀴
1307𓀴“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes
1308𓀴under the full market price. It is not a common experience among
1309𓀴employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as
1310𓀴remarkable as your advertisement.”
1311𓀴
1312𓀴“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow
1313𓀴for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be
1314𓀴improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit
1315𓀴into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on
1316𓀴the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”
1317𓀴
1318𓀴“He is still with you, I presume?”
1319𓀴
1320𓀴“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking
1321𓀴and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a
1322𓀴widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three
1323𓀴of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do
1324𓀴nothing more.
1325𓀴
1326𓀴“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he
1327𓀴came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very
1328𓀴paper in his hand, and he says:
1329𓀴
1330𓀴“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’
1331𓀴
1332𓀴“‘Why that?’ I asks.
1333𓀴
1334𓀴“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the
1335𓀴Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets
1336𓀴it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,
1337𓀴so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.
1338𓀴If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all
1339𓀴ready for me to step into.’
1340𓀴
1341𓀴“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very
1342𓀴stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to
1343𓀴go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the
1344𓀴door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,
1345𓀴and I was always glad of a bit of news.
1346𓀴
1347𓀴“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked
1348𓀴with his eyes open.
1349𓀴
1350𓀴“‘Never.’
1351𓀴
1352𓀴“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the
1353𓀴vacancies.’
1354𓀴
1355𓀴“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.
1356𓀴
1357𓀴“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it
1358𓀴need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’
1359𓀴
1360𓀴“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the
1361𓀴business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of
1362𓀴hundred would have been very handy.
1363𓀴
1364𓀴“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.
1365𓀴
1366𓀴“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for
1367𓀴yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where
1368𓀴you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League
1369𓀴was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very
1370𓀴peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great
1371𓀴sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he
1372𓀴had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with
1373𓀴instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to
1374𓀴men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay
1375𓀴and very little to do.’
1376𓀴
1377𓀴“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would
1378𓀴apply.’
1379𓀴
1380𓀴“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really
1381𓀴confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from
1382𓀴London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.
1383𓀴Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is
1384𓀴light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery
1385𓀴red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;
1386𓀴but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of
1387𓀴the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’
1388𓀴
1389𓀴“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my
1390𓀴hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if
1391𓀴there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance
1392𓀴as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so
1393𓀴much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered
1394𓀴him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.
1395𓀴He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and
1396𓀴started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
1397𓀴
1398𓀴“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
1399𓀴north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his
1400𓀴hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet
1401𓀴Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a
1402𓀴coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in
1403𓀴the whole country as were brought together by that single
1404𓀴advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange,
1405𓀴brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were
1406𓀴not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how
1407𓀴many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding
1408𓀴would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed
1409𓀴and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
1410𓀴to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon
1411𓀴the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we
1412𓀴wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”
1413𓀴
1414𓀴“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as
1415𓀴his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
1416𓀴“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”
1417𓀴
1418𓀴“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a
1419𓀴deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even
1420𓀴redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,
1421𓀴and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would
1422𓀴disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy
1423𓀴matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much
1424𓀴more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door
1425𓀴as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
1426𓀴
1427𓀴“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to
1428𓀴fill a vacancy in the League.’
1429𓀴
1430𓀴“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every
1431𓀴requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He
1432𓀴took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair
1433𓀴until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my
1434𓀴hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
1435𓀴
1436𓀴“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am
1437𓀴sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized
1438𓀴my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.
1439𓀴‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive
1440𓀴that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have
1441𓀴twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales
1442𓀴of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped
1443𓀴over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that
1444𓀴the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
1445𓀴and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was
1446𓀴not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
1447𓀴
1448𓀴“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the
1449𓀴pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a
1450𓀴married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’
1451𓀴
1452𓀴“I answered that I had not.
1453𓀴
1454𓀴“His face fell immediately.
1455𓀴
1456𓀴“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry
1457𓀴to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and
1458𓀴spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is
1459𓀴exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’
1460𓀴
1461𓀴“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not
1462𓀴to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few
1463𓀴minutes he said that it would be all right.
1464𓀴
1465𓀴“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but
1466𓀴we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as
1467𓀴yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’
1468𓀴
1469𓀴“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.
1470𓀴
1471𓀴“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I
1472𓀴should be able to look after that for you.’
1473𓀴
1474𓀴“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.
1475𓀴
1476𓀴“‘Ten to two.’
1477𓀴
1478𓀴“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,
1479𓀴especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;
1480𓀴so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
1481𓀴Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see
1482𓀴to anything that turned up.
1483𓀴
1484𓀴“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’
1485𓀴
1486𓀴“‘Is £ 4 a week.’
1487𓀴
1488𓀴“‘And the work?’
1489𓀴
1490𓀴“‘Is purely nominal.’
1491𓀴
1492𓀴“‘What do you call purely nominal?’
1493𓀴
1494𓀴“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the
1495𓀴whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The
1496𓀴will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the
1497𓀴conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’
1498𓀴
1499𓀴“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said
1500𓀴I.
1501𓀴
1502𓀴“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor
1503𓀴business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your
1504𓀴billet.’
1505𓀴
1506𓀴“‘And the work?’
1507𓀴
1508𓀴“‘Is to copy out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. There is the first
1509𓀴volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
1510𓀴blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready
1511𓀴to-morrow?’
1512𓀴
1513𓀴“‘Certainly,’ I answered.
1514𓀴
1515𓀴“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once
1516𓀴more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to
1517𓀴gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,
1518𓀴hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good
1519𓀴fortune.
1520𓀴
1521𓀴“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low
1522𓀴spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair
1523𓀴must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I
1524𓀴could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could
1525𓀴make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything
1526𓀴so simple as copying out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. Vincent
1527𓀴Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had
1528𓀴reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I
1529𓀴determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of
1530𓀴ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I
1531𓀴started off for Pope’s Court.
1532𓀴
1533𓀴“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
1534𓀴The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to
1535𓀴see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and
1536𓀴then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all
1537𓀴was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me
1538𓀴upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office
1539𓀴after me.
1540𓀴
1541𓀴“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager
1542𓀴came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It
1543𓀴was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
1544𓀴was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
1545𓀴Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
1546𓀴time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
1547𓀴leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
1548𓀴and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
1549𓀴not risk the loss of it.
1550𓀴
1551𓀴“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
1552𓀴Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
1553𓀴diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me
1554𓀴something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
1555𓀴writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”
1556𓀴
1557𓀴“To an end?”
1558𓀴
1559𓀴“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
1560𓀴at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
1561𓀴of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
1562𓀴it is, and you can read for yourself.”
1563𓀴
1564𓀴He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
1565𓀴note-paper. It read in this fashion:
1566𓀴
1567𓀴“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”
1568𓀴
1569𓀴
1570𓀴Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
1571𓀴face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
1572𓀴overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
1573𓀴of laughter.
1574𓀴
1575𓀴“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,
1576𓀴flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing
1577𓀴better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”
1578𓀴
1579𓀴“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
1580𓀴had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is
1581𓀴most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
1582𓀴so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
1583𓀴take when you found the card upon the door?”
1584𓀴
1585𓀴“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
1586𓀴offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
1587𓀴Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
1588𓀴ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
1589𓀴the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
1590𓀴body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
1591𓀴name was new to him.
1592𓀴
1593𓀴“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’
1594𓀴
1595𓀴“‘What, the red-headed man?’
1596𓀴
1597𓀴“‘Yes.’
1598𓀴
1599𓀴“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
1600𓀴was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
1601𓀴were ready. He moved out yesterday.’
1602𓀴
1603𓀴“‘Where could I find him?’
1604𓀴
1605𓀴“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
1606𓀴Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’
1607𓀴
1608𓀴“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
1609𓀴manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
1610𓀴either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”
1611𓀴
1612𓀴“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.
1613𓀴
1614𓀴“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
1615𓀴assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
1616𓀴if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
1617𓀴Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
1618𓀴as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
1619𓀴who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”
1620𓀴
1621𓀴“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly
1622𓀴remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
1623𓀴have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
1624𓀴it than might at first sight appear.”
1625𓀴
1626𓀴“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a
1627𓀴week.”
1628𓀴
1629𓀴“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not
1630𓀴see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
1631𓀴the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say
1632𓀴nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
1633𓀴which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”
1634𓀴
1635𓀴“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
1636𓀴their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It
1637𓀴was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
1638𓀴pounds.”
1639𓀴
1640𓀴“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
1641𓀴or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
1642𓀴your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”
1643𓀴
1644𓀴“About a month then.”
1645𓀴
1646𓀴“How did he come?”
1647𓀴
1648𓀴“In answer to an advertisement.”
1649𓀴
1650𓀴“Was he the only applicant?”
1651𓀴
1652𓀴“No, I had a dozen.”
1653𓀴
1654𓀴“Why did you pick him?”
1655𓀴
1656𓀴“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”
1657𓀴
1658𓀴“At half wages, in fact.”
1659𓀴
1660𓀴“Yes.”
1661𓀴
1662𓀴“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”
1663𓀴
1664𓀴“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
1665𓀴though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
1666𓀴forehead.”
1667𓀴
1668𓀴Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as
1669𓀴much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
1670𓀴earrings?”
1671𓀴
1672𓀴“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
1673𓀴lad.”
1674𓀴
1675𓀴“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with
1676𓀴you?”
1677𓀴
1678𓀴“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”
1679𓀴
1680𓀴“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”
1681𓀴
1682𓀴“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a
1683𓀴morning.”
1684𓀴
1685𓀴“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
1686𓀴the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
1687𓀴hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”
1688𓀴
1689𓀴“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you
1690𓀴make of it all?”
1691𓀴
1692𓀴“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious
1693𓀴business.”
1694𓀴
1695𓀴“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less
1696𓀴mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
1697𓀴which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
1698𓀴difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”
1699𓀴
1700𓀴“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.
1701𓀴
1702𓀴“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
1703𓀴that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in
1704𓀴his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
1705𓀴there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
1706𓀴like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
1707𓀴he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
1708𓀴sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
1709𓀴mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
1710𓀴
1711𓀴“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.
1712𓀴“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few
1713𓀴hours?”
1714𓀴
1715𓀴“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”
1716𓀴
1717𓀴“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and
1718𓀴we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal
1719𓀴of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
1720𓀴Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come
1721𓀴along!”
1722𓀴
1723𓀴We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk
1724𓀴took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we
1725𓀴had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel
1726𓀴place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out
1727𓀴into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few
1728𓀴clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden
1729𓀴and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
1730𓀴“JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the
1731𓀴place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock
1732𓀴Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it
1733𓀴all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he
1734𓀴walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still
1735𓀴looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,
1736𓀴and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or
1737𓀴three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly
1738𓀴opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to
1739𓀴step in.
1740𓀴
1741𓀴“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go
1742𓀴from here to the Strand.”
1743𓀴
1744𓀴“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing
1745𓀴the door.
1746𓀴
1747𓀴“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my
1748𓀴judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not
1749𓀴sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him
1750𓀴before.”
1751𓀴
1752𓀴“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in
1753𓀴this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your
1754𓀴way merely in order that you might see him.”
1755𓀴
1756𓀴“Not him.”
1757𓀴
1758𓀴“What then?”
1759𓀴
1760𓀴“The knees of his trousers.”
1761𓀴
1762𓀴“And what did you see?”
1763𓀴
1764𓀴“What I expected to see.”
1765𓀴
1766𓀴“Why did you beat the pavement?”
1767𓀴
1768𓀴“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are
1769𓀴spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.
1770𓀴Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”
1771𓀴
1772𓀴The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from
1773𓀴the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as
1774𓀴the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main
1775𓀴arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.
1776𓀴The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in
1777𓀴a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with
1778𓀴the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we
1779𓀴looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that
1780𓀴they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant
1781𓀴square which we had just quitted.
1782𓀴
1783𓀴“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along
1784𓀴the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
1785𓀴It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is
1786𓀴Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg
1787𓀴branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and
1788𓀴McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the
1789𓀴other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had
1790𓀴some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,
1791𓀴where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
1792𓀴red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”
1793𓀴
1794𓀴My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very
1795𓀴capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the
1796𓀴afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,
1797𓀴gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his
1798𓀴gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those
1799𓀴of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,
1800𓀴ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his
1801𓀴singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his
1802𓀴extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,
1803𓀴the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which
1804𓀴occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
1805𓀴extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never
1806𓀴so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in
1807𓀴his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.
1808𓀴Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,
1809𓀴and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of
1810𓀴intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would
1811𓀴look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other
1812𓀴mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.
1813𓀴James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom
1814𓀴he had set himself to hunt down.
1815𓀴
1816𓀴“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.
1817𓀴
1818𓀴“Yes, it would be as well.”
1819𓀴
1820𓀴“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
1821𓀴business at Coburg Square is serious.”
1822𓀴
1823𓀴“Why serious?”
1824𓀴
1825𓀴“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
1826𓀴believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday
1827𓀴rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”
1828𓀴
1829𓀴“At what time?”
1830𓀴
1831𓀴“Ten will be early enough.”
1832𓀴
1833𓀴“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”
1834𓀴
1835𓀴“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so
1836𓀴kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,
1837𓀴turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
1838𓀴
1839𓀴I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always
1840𓀴oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock
1841𓀴Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had
1842𓀴seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not
1843𓀴only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the
1844𓀴whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my
1845𓀴house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story
1846𓀴of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to
1847𓀴Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from
1848𓀴me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
1849𓀴Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes
1850𓀴that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a
1851𓀴man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it
1852𓀴up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an
1853𓀴explanation.
1854𓀴
1855𓀴It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way
1856𓀴across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two
1857𓀴hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard
1858𓀴the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in
1859𓀴animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter
1860𓀴Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,
1861𓀴sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable
1862𓀴frock-coat.
1863𓀴
1864𓀴“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket
1865𓀴and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you
1866𓀴know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.
1867𓀴Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”
1868𓀴
1869𓀴“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his
1870𓀴consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a
1871𓀴chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”
1872𓀴
1873𓀴“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”
1874𓀴observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
1875𓀴
1876𓀴“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the
1877𓀴police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he
1878𓀴won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,
1879𓀴but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say
1880𓀴that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the
1881𓀴Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official
1882𓀴force.”
1883𓀴
1884𓀴“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with
1885𓀴deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first
1886𓀴Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my
1887𓀴rubber.”
1888𓀴
1889𓀴“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for
1890𓀴a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play
1891𓀴will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be
1892𓀴some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you
1893𓀴wish to lay your hands.”
1894𓀴
1895𓀴“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,
1896𓀴Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would
1897𓀴rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a
1898𓀴remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,
1899𓀴and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as
1900𓀴his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never
1901𓀴know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one
1902𓀴week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
1903𓀴I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”
1904𓀴
1905𓀴“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve
1906𓀴had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with
1907𓀴you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,
1908𓀴and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,
1909𓀴Watson and I will follow in the second.”
1910𓀴
1911𓀴Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and
1912𓀴lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
1913𓀴afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
1914𓀴until we emerged into Farrington Street.
1915𓀴
1916𓀴“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather
1917𓀴is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought
1918𓀴it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though
1919𓀴an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He
1920𓀴is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his
1921𓀴claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”
1922𓀴
1923𓀴We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
1924𓀴ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the
1925𓀴guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and
1926𓀴through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small
1927𓀴corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was
1928𓀴opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated
1929𓀴at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a
1930𓀴lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and
1931𓀴so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was
1932𓀴piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
1933𓀴
1934𓀴“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up
1935𓀴the lantern and gazed about him.
1936𓀴
1937𓀴“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the
1938𓀴flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he
1939𓀴remarked, looking up in surprise.
1940𓀴
1941𓀴“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes
1942𓀴severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our
1943𓀴expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down
1944𓀴upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”
1945𓀴
1946𓀴The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very
1947𓀴injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon
1948𓀴the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine
1949𓀴minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to
1950𓀴satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his
1951𓀴pocket.
1952𓀴
1953𓀴“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly
1954𓀴take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they
1955𓀴will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer
1956𓀴time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no
1957𓀴doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the
1958𓀴principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,
1959𓀴and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring
1960𓀴criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar
1961𓀴at present.”
1962𓀴
1963𓀴“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several
1964𓀴warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”
1965𓀴
1966𓀴“Your French gold?”
1967𓀴
1968𓀴“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and
1969𓀴borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It
1970𓀴has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,
1971𓀴and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit
1972𓀴contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our
1973𓀴reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a
1974𓀴single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the
1975𓀴subject.”
1976𓀴
1977𓀴“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time
1978𓀴that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters
1979𓀴will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the
1980𓀴screen over that dark lantern.”
1981𓀴
1982𓀴“And sit in the dark?”
1983𓀴
1984𓀴“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I
1985𓀴thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber
1986𓀴after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far
1987𓀴that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must
1988𓀴choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take
1989𓀴them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
1990𓀴I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind
1991𓀴those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they
1992𓀴fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”
1993𓀴
1994𓀴I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
1995𓀴which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
1996𓀴and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never
1997𓀴before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that
1998𓀴the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To
1999𓀴me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was
2000𓀴something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold
2001𓀴dank air of the vault.
2002𓀴
2003𓀴“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through
2004𓀴the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I
2005𓀴asked you, Jones?”
2006𓀴
2007𓀴“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”
2008𓀴
2009𓀴“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and
2010𓀴wait.”
2011𓀴
2012𓀴What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an
2013𓀴hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have
2014𓀴almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and
2015𓀴stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up
2016𓀴to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I
2017𓀴could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could
2018𓀴distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the
2019𓀴thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look
2020𓀴over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught
2021𓀴the glint of a light.
2022𓀴
2023𓀴At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it
2024𓀴lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any
2025𓀴warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,
2026𓀴almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area
2027𓀴of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,
2028𓀴protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it
2029𓀴appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which
2030𓀴marked a chink between the stones.
2031𓀴
2032𓀴Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing
2033𓀴sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and
2034𓀴left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a
2035𓀴lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which
2036𓀴looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the
2037𓀴aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee
2038𓀴rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the
2039𓀴hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like
2040𓀴himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
2041𓀴
2042𓀴“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?
2043𓀴Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”
2044𓀴
2045𓀴Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
2046𓀴The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth
2047𓀴as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a
2048𓀴revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and
2049𓀴the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
2050𓀴
2051𓀴“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at
2052𓀴all.”
2053𓀴
2054𓀴“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that
2055𓀴my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”
2056𓀴
2057𓀴“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.
2058𓀴
2059𓀴“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must
2060𓀴compliment you.”
2061𓀴
2062𓀴“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and
2063𓀴effective.”
2064𓀴
2065𓀴“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at
2066𓀴climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”
2067𓀴
2068𓀴“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our
2069𓀴prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be
2070𓀴aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,
2071𓀴when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”
2072𓀴
2073𓀴“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you
2074𓀴please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your
2075𓀴Highness to the police-station?”
2076𓀴
2077𓀴“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to
2078𓀴the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
2079𓀴
2080𓀴“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from
2081𓀴the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
2082𓀴There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most
2083𓀴complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
2084𓀴that have ever come within my experience.”
2085𓀴
2086𓀴“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John
2087𓀴Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this
2088𓀴matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am
2089𓀴amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,
2090𓀴and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”
2091𓀴
2092𓀴“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we
2093𓀴sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly
2094𓀴obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather
2095𓀴fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying
2096𓀴of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker
2097𓀴out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of
2098𓀴managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.
2099𓀴The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the
2100𓀴colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must
2101𓀴draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They
2102𓀴put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other
2103𓀴rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to
2104𓀴secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I
2105𓀴heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me
2106𓀴that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”
2107𓀴
2108𓀴“But how could you guess what the motive was?”
2109𓀴
2110𓀴“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere
2111𓀴vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s
2112𓀴business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which
2113𓀴could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure
2114𓀴as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What
2115𓀴could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and
2116𓀴his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end
2117𓀴of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious
2118𓀴assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most
2119𓀴daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the
2120𓀴cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What
2121𓀴could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was
2122𓀴running a tunnel to some other building.
2123𓀴
2124𓀴“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
2125𓀴surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
2126𓀴ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It
2127𓀴was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant
2128𓀴answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes
2129𓀴upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were
2130𓀴what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,
2131𓀴wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of
2132𓀴burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I
2133𓀴walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our
2134𓀴friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you
2135𓀴drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the
2136𓀴chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”
2137𓀴
2138𓀴“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I
2139𓀴asked.
2140𓀴
2141𓀴“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they
2142𓀴cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that
2143𓀴they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should
2144𓀴use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be
2145𓀴removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it
2146𓀴would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I
2147𓀴expected them to come to-night.”
2148𓀴
2149𓀴“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.
2150𓀴“It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”
2151𓀴
2152𓀴“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel
2153𓀴it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape
2154𓀴from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do
2155𓀴so.”
2156𓀴
2157𓀴“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.
2158𓀴
2159𓀴He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some
2160𓀴little use,” he remarked. “‘_L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout_,’
2161𓀴as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”
2162𓀴
2163𓀴
2164𓀴
2165𓀴
2166𓀴III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
2167𓀴
2168𓀴
2169𓀴“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the
2170𓀴fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than
2171𓀴anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to
2172𓀴conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If
2173𓀴we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great
2174𓀴city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which
2175𓀴are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the
2176𓀴cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
2177𓀴generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all
2178𓀴fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale
2179𓀴and unprofitable.”
2180𓀴
2181𓀴“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come
2182𓀴to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
2183𓀴We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and
2184𓀴yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor
2185𓀴artistic.”
2186𓀴
2187𓀴“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
2188𓀴realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police
2189𓀴report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the
2190𓀴magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the
2191𓀴vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so
2192𓀴unnatural as the commonplace.”
2193𓀴
2194𓀴I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,”
2195𓀴I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper
2196𓀴to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
2197𓀴you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But
2198𓀴here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a
2199𓀴practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A
2200𓀴husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I
2201𓀴know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There
2202𓀴is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
2203𓀴bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers
2204𓀴could invent nothing more crude.”
2205𓀴
2206𓀴“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said
2207𓀴Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the
2208𓀴Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing
2209𓀴up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a
2210𓀴teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was
2211𓀴that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking
2212𓀴out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will
2213𓀴allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the
2214𓀴average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge
2215𓀴that I have scored over you in your example.”
2216𓀴
2217𓀴He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the
2218𓀴centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely
2219𓀴ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
2220𓀴
2221𓀴“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is
2222𓀴a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance
2223𓀴in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”
2224𓀴
2225𓀴“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
2226𓀴sparkled upon his finger.
2227𓀴
2228𓀴“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which
2229𓀴I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to
2230𓀴you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
2231𓀴problems.”
2232𓀴
2233𓀴“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.
2234𓀴
2235𓀴“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
2236𓀴They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,
2237𓀴I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a
2238𓀴field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and
2239𓀴effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are
2240𓀴apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a
2241𓀴rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate
2242𓀴matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
2243𓀴which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that
2244𓀴I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this
2245𓀴is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”
2246𓀴
2247𓀴He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds
2248𓀴gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over
2249𓀴his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large
2250𓀴woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red
2251𓀴feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess
2252𓀴of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she
2253𓀴peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her
2254𓀴body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her
2255𓀴glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
2256𓀴the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of
2257𓀴the bell.
2258𓀴
2259𓀴“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his
2260𓀴cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an
2261𓀴_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the
2262𓀴matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may
2263𓀴discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no
2264𓀴longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we
2265𓀴may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so
2266𓀴much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to
2267𓀴resolve our doubts.”
2268𓀴
2269𓀴As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered
2270𓀴to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind
2271𓀴his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny
2272𓀴pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
2273𓀴which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into
2274𓀴an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted
2275𓀴fashion which was peculiar to him.
2276𓀴
2277𓀴“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little
2278𓀴trying to do so much typewriting?”
2279𓀴
2280𓀴“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are
2281𓀴without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his
2282𓀴words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
2283𓀴astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard about
2284𓀴me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”
2285𓀴
2286𓀴“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.
2287𓀴Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why
2288𓀴should you come to consult me?”
2289𓀴
2290𓀴“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose
2291𓀴husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up
2292𓀴for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not
2293𓀴rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the
2294𓀴little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what
2295𓀴has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
2296𓀴
2297𓀴“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock
2298𓀴Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
2299𓀴
2300𓀴Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary
2301𓀴Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made
2302𓀴me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my
2303𓀴father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go
2304𓀴to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that
2305𓀴there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things
2306𓀴and came right away to you.”
2307𓀴
2308𓀴“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is
2309𓀴different.”
2310𓀴
2311𓀴“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,
2312𓀴for he is only five years and two months older than myself.”
2313𓀴
2314𓀴“And your mother is alive?”
2315𓀴
2316𓀴“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,
2317𓀴when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was
2318𓀴nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the
2319𓀴Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which
2320𓀴mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank
2321𓀴came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a
2322𓀴traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,
2323𓀴which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been
2324𓀴alive.”
2325𓀴
2326𓀴I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and
2327𓀴inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with
2328𓀴the greatest concentration of attention.
2329𓀴
2330𓀴“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”
2331𓀴
2332𓀴“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in
2333𓀴Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand
2334𓀴five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”
2335𓀴
2336𓀴“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large
2337𓀴a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no
2338𓀴doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that
2339𓀴a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”
2340𓀴
2341𓀴“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand
2342𓀴that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and
2343𓀴so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of
2344𓀴course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest
2345𓀴every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do
2346𓀴pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a
2347𓀴sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”
2348𓀴
2349𓀴“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is
2350𓀴my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before
2351𓀴myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer
2352𓀴Angel.”
2353𓀴
2354𓀴A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at
2355𓀴the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”
2356𓀴she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then
2357𓀴afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank
2358𓀴did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would
2359𓀴get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But
2360𓀴this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
2361𓀴prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
2362𓀴father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit
2363𓀴to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken
2364𓀴out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to
2365𓀴France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with
2366𓀴Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.
2367𓀴Hosmer Angel.”
2368𓀴
2369𓀴“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from
2370𓀴France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”
2371𓀴
2372𓀴“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
2373𓀴shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a
2374𓀴woman, for she would have her way.”
2375𓀴
2376𓀴“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a
2377𓀴gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
2378𓀴
2379𓀴“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we
2380𓀴had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.
2381𓀴Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back
2382𓀴again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”
2383𓀴
2384𓀴“No?”
2385𓀴
2386𓀴“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t
2387𓀴have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman
2388𓀴should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to
2389𓀴mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got
2390𓀴mine yet.”
2391𓀴
2392𓀴“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”
2393𓀴
2394𓀴“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote
2395𓀴and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until
2396𓀴he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every
2397𓀴day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for
2398𓀴father to know.”
2399𓀴
2400𓀴“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”
2401𓀴
2402𓀴“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we
2403𓀴took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall
2404𓀴Street—and—”
2405𓀴
2406𓀴“What office?”
2407𓀴
2408𓀴“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”
2409𓀴
2410𓀴“Where did he live, then?”
2411𓀴
2412𓀴“He slept on the premises.”
2413𓀴
2414𓀴“And you don’t know his address?”
2415𓀴
2416𓀴“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”
2417𓀴
2418𓀴“Where did you address your letters, then?”
2419𓀴
2420𓀴“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He
2421𓀴said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all
2422𓀴the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to
2423𓀴typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said
2424𓀴that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were
2425𓀴typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That
2426𓀴will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little
2427𓀴things that he would think of.”
2428𓀴
2429𓀴“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of
2430𓀴mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you
2431𓀴remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”
2432𓀴
2433𓀴“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the
2434𓀴evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be
2435𓀴conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was
2436𓀴gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he
2437𓀴told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,
2438𓀴whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and
2439𓀴plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted
2440𓀴glasses against the glare.”
2441𓀴
2442𓀴“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned
2443𓀴to France?”
2444𓀴
2445𓀴“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should
2446𓀴marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me
2447𓀴swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would
2448𓀴always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,
2449𓀴and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour
2450𓀴from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they
2451𓀴talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but
2452𓀴they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
2453𓀴afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I
2454𓀴didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask
2455𓀴his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want
2456𓀴to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
2457𓀴company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the
2458𓀴very morning of the wedding.”
2459𓀴
2460𓀴“It missed him, then?”
2461𓀴
2462𓀴“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”
2463𓀴
2464𓀴“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the
2465𓀴Friday. Was it to be in church?”
2466𓀴
2467𓀴“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s
2468𓀴Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras
2469𓀴Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he
2470𓀴put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which
2471𓀴happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church
2472𓀴first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step
2473𓀴out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and
2474𓀴looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not
2475𓀴imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own
2476𓀴eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard
2477𓀴anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”
2478𓀴
2479𓀴“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said
2480𓀴Holmes.
2481𓀴
2482𓀴“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the
2483𓀴morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;
2484𓀴and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I
2485𓀴was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would
2486𓀴claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a
2487𓀴wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”
2488𓀴
2489𓀴“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
2490𓀴unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”
2491𓀴
2492𓀴“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not
2493𓀴have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”
2494𓀴
2495𓀴“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”
2496𓀴
2497𓀴“None.”
2498𓀴
2499𓀴“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”
2500𓀴
2501𓀴“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
2502𓀴again.”
2503𓀴
2504𓀴“And your father? Did you tell him?”
2505𓀴
2506𓀴“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and
2507𓀴that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could
2508𓀴anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving
2509𓀴me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got
2510𓀴my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was
2511𓀴very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of
2512𓀴mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?
2513𓀴Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at
2514𓀴night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to
2515𓀴sob heavily into it.
2516𓀴
2517𓀴“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I
2518𓀴have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight
2519𓀴of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it
2520𓀴further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your
2521𓀴memory, as he has done from your life.”
2522𓀴
2523𓀴“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”
2524𓀴
2525𓀴“I fear not.”
2526𓀴
2527𓀴“Then what has happened to him?”
2528𓀴
2529𓀴“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate
2530𓀴description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”
2531𓀴
2532𓀴“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,” said she. “Here
2533𓀴is the slip and here are four letters from him.”
2534𓀴
2535𓀴“Thank you. And your address?”
2536𓀴
2537𓀴“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”
2538𓀴
2539𓀴“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your
2540𓀴father’s place of business?”
2541𓀴
2542𓀴“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of
2543𓀴Fenchurch Street.”
2544𓀴
2545𓀴“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave
2546𓀴the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let
2547𓀴the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your
2548𓀴life.”
2549𓀴
2550𓀴“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true
2551𓀴to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”
2552𓀴
2553𓀴For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something
2554𓀴noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.
2555𓀴She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,
2556𓀴with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
2557𓀴
2558𓀴Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
2559𓀴pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze
2560𓀴directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old
2561𓀴and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit
2562𓀴it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths
2563𓀴spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
2564𓀴
2565𓀴“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her
2566𓀴more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather
2567𓀴a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in
2568𓀴Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last
2569𓀴year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which
2570𓀴were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”
2571𓀴
2572𓀴“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to
2573𓀴me,” I remarked.
2574𓀴
2575𓀴“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,
2576𓀴and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to
2577𓀴realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,
2578𓀴or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you
2579𓀴gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”
2580𓀴
2581𓀴“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
2582𓀴feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn
2583𓀴upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was
2584𓀴brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at
2585𓀴the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at
2586𓀴the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,
2587𓀴hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in
2588𓀴a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”
2589𓀴
2590𓀴Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
2591𓀴
2592𓀴“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
2593𓀴really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
2594𓀴everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you
2595𓀴have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my
2596𓀴boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always
2597𓀴at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the
2598𓀴knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her
2599𓀴sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double
2600𓀴line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against
2601𓀴the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand
2602𓀴type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
2603𓀴of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
2604𓀴broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing
2605𓀴the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark
2606𓀴upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”
2607𓀴
2608𓀴“It surprised me.”
2609𓀴
2610𓀴“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested
2611𓀴on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was
2612𓀴wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one
2613𓀴having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was
2614𓀴buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at
2615𓀴the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,
2616𓀴otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,
2617𓀴half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
2618𓀴hurry.”
2619𓀴
2620𓀴“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my
2621𓀴friend’s incisive reasoning.
2622𓀴
2623𓀴“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home
2624𓀴but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was
2625𓀴torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove
2626𓀴and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and
2627𓀴dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark
2628𓀴would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though
2629𓀴rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you
2630𓀴mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”
2631𓀴
2632𓀴I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on
2633𓀴the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About
2634𓀴five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black
2635𓀴hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and
2636𓀴moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,
2637𓀴when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,
2638𓀴gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters
2639𓀴over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
2640𓀴Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c, &c.
2641𓀴
2642𓀴“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,
2643𓀴glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in
2644𓀴them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one
2645𓀴remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”
2646𓀴
2647𓀴“They are typewritten,” I remarked.
2648𓀴
2649𓀴“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat
2650𓀴little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no
2651𓀴superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The
2652𓀴point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it
2653𓀴conclusive.”
2654𓀴
2655𓀴“Of what?”
2656𓀴
2657𓀴“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears
2658𓀴upon the case?”
2659𓀴
2660𓀴“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to
2661𓀴deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”
2662𓀴
2663𓀴“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which
2664𓀴should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to
2665𓀴the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could
2666𓀴meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that
2667𓀴we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can
2668𓀴do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our
2669𓀴little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”
2670𓀴
2671𓀴I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of
2672𓀴reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must
2673𓀴have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which
2674𓀴he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to
2675𓀴fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of
2676𓀴Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to
2677𓀴the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary
2678𓀴circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would
2679𓀴be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
2680𓀴
2681𓀴I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
2682𓀴conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that
2683𓀴he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity
2684𓀴of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
2685𓀴
2686𓀴A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at
2687𓀴the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the
2688𓀴sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself
2689𓀴free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,
2690𓀴half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of
2691𓀴the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half
2692𓀴asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his
2693𓀴armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the
2694𓀴pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent
2695𓀴his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
2696𓀴
2697𓀴“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.
2698𓀴
2699𓀴“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”
2700𓀴
2701𓀴“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.
2702𓀴
2703𓀴“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There
2704𓀴was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some
2705𓀴of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no
2706𓀴law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”
2707𓀴
2708𓀴“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
2709𓀴Sutherland?”
2710𓀴
2711𓀴The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened
2712𓀴his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a
2713𓀴tap at the door.
2714𓀴
2715𓀴“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He
2716𓀴has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”
2717𓀴
2718𓀴The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty
2719𓀴years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,
2720𓀴insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
2721𓀴grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny
2722𓀴top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the
2723𓀴nearest chair.
2724𓀴
2725𓀴“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this
2726𓀴typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with
2727𓀴me for six o’clock?”
2728𓀴
2729𓀴“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my
2730𓀴own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you
2731𓀴about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash
2732𓀴linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she
2733𓀴came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have
2734𓀴noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind
2735𓀴on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not
2736𓀴connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a
2737𓀴family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
2738𓀴expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”
2739𓀴
2740𓀴“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe
2741𓀴that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
2742𓀴
2743𓀴Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am
2744𓀴delighted to hear it,” he said.
2745𓀴
2746𓀴“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really
2747𓀴quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are
2748𓀴quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more
2749𓀴worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in
2750𓀴this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some
2751𓀴little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the
2752𓀴‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more
2753𓀴obvious.”
2754𓀴
2755𓀴“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no
2756𓀴doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at
2757𓀴Holmes with his bright little eyes.
2758𓀴
2759𓀴“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.
2760𓀴Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little
2761𓀴monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to
2762𓀴crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I
2763𓀴have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They
2764𓀴are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and
2765𓀴the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my
2766𓀴magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I
2767𓀴have alluded are there as well.”
2768𓀴
2769𓀴Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot
2770𓀴waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If
2771𓀴you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done
2772𓀴it.”
2773𓀴
2774𓀴“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the
2775𓀴door. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”
2776𓀴
2777𓀴“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and
2778𓀴glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
2779𓀴
2780𓀴“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no
2781𓀴possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,
2782𓀴and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible
2783𓀴for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us
2784𓀴talk it over.”
2785𓀴
2786𓀴Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter
2787𓀴of moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.
2788𓀴
2789𓀴“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
2790𓀴Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty
2791𓀴way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of
2792𓀴events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”
2793𓀴
2794𓀴The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
2795𓀴breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on
2796𓀴the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his
2797𓀴pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
2798𓀴
2799𓀴“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”
2800𓀴said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long
2801𓀴as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their
2802𓀴position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It
2803𓀴was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable
2804𓀴disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it
2805𓀴was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little
2806𓀴income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her
2807𓀴marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what
2808𓀴does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
2809𓀴keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of
2810𓀴her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She
2811𓀴became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her
2812𓀴positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever
2813𓀴stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
2814𓀴than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he
2815𓀴disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked
2816𓀴the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear
2817𓀴voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
2818𓀴girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other
2819𓀴lovers by making love himself.”
2820𓀴
2821𓀴“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought
2822𓀴that she would have been so carried away.”
2823𓀴
2824𓀴“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
2825𓀴decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her
2826𓀴stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an
2827𓀴instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s
2828𓀴attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
2829𓀴admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was
2830𓀴obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a
2831𓀴real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an
2832𓀴engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from
2833𓀴turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up
2834𓀴forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The
2835𓀴thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a
2836𓀴dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the
2837𓀴young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor
2838𓀴for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a
2839𓀴Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something
2840𓀴happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished
2841𓀴Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
2842𓀴his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen
2843𓀴to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as
2844𓀴he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
2845𓀴of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I
2846𓀴think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”
2847𓀴
2848𓀴Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had
2849𓀴been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his
2850𓀴pale face.
2851𓀴
2852𓀴“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so
2853𓀴very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are
2854𓀴breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from
2855𓀴the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself
2856𓀴open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”
2857𓀴
2858𓀴“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and
2859𓀴throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved
2860𓀴punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought
2861𓀴to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing
2862𓀴up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not
2863𓀴part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I
2864𓀴think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the
2865𓀴whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps
2866𓀴upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we
2867𓀴could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the
2868𓀴road.
2869𓀴
2870𓀴“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw
2871𓀴himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from
2872𓀴crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.
2873𓀴The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”
2874𓀴
2875𓀴“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I
2876𓀴remarked.
2877𓀴
2878𓀴“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer
2879𓀴Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was
2880𓀴equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as
2881𓀴far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men
2882𓀴were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other
2883𓀴was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious
2884𓀴voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
2885𓀴suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his
2886𓀴signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so
2887𓀴familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of
2888𓀴it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,
2889𓀴all pointed in the same direction.”
2890𓀴
2891𓀴“And how did you verify them?”
2892𓀴
2893𓀴“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew
2894𓀴the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
2895𓀴description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result
2896𓀴of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to
2897𓀴the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered
2898𓀴to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed
2899𓀴the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at
2900𓀴his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,
2901𓀴his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
2902𓀴characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
2903𓀴Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description
2904𓀴tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.
2905𓀴_Voilà tout_!”
2906𓀴
2907𓀴“And Miss Sutherland?”
2908𓀴
2909𓀴“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
2910𓀴Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and
2911𓀴danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as
2912𓀴much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”
2913𓀴
2914𓀴
2915𓀴
2916𓀴
2917𓀴IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
2918𓀴
2919𓀴
2920𓀴We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid
2921𓀴brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:
2922𓀴
2923𓀴“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the
2924𓀴west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be
2925𓀴glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave
2926𓀴Paddington by the 11:15.”
2927𓀴
2928𓀴“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you
2929𓀴go?”
2930𓀴
2931𓀴“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
2932𓀴present.”
2933𓀴
2934𓀴“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a
2935𓀴little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you
2936𓀴are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.”
2937𓀴
2938𓀴“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one
2939𓀴of them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I
2940𓀴have only half an hour.”
2941𓀴
2942𓀴My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
2943𓀴of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and
2944𓀴simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my
2945𓀴valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing
2946𓀴up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and
2947𓀴taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
2948𓀴
2949𓀴“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a
2950𓀴considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can
2951𓀴thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.
2952𓀴If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”
2953𓀴
2954𓀴We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
2955𓀴which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,
2956𓀴with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past
2957𓀴Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and
2958𓀴tossed them up onto the rack.
2959𓀴
2960𓀴“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.
2961𓀴
2962𓀴“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”
2963𓀴
2964𓀴“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been
2965𓀴looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
2966𓀴particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple
2967𓀴cases which are so extremely difficult.”
2968𓀴
2969𓀴“That sounds a little paradoxical.”
2970𓀴
2971𓀴“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.
2972𓀴The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it
2973𓀴is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a
2974𓀴very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”
2975𓀴
2976𓀴“It is a murder, then?”
2977𓀴
2978𓀴“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted
2979𓀴until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will
2980𓀴explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to
2981𓀴understand it, in a very few words.
2982𓀴
2983𓀴“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
2984𓀴Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John
2985𓀴Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to
2986𓀴the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was
2987𓀴let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had
2988𓀴known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that
2989𓀴when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as
2990𓀴possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
2991𓀴tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as
2992𓀴they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,
2993𓀴and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them
2994𓀴had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the
2995𓀴neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though
2996𓀴both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the
2997𓀴race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man
2998𓀴and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
2999𓀴least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
3000𓀴families. Now for the facts.
3001𓀴
3002𓀴“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
3003𓀴Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe
3004𓀴Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream
3005𓀴which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his
3006𓀴serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he
3007𓀴must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.
3008𓀴From that appointment he never came back alive.
3009𓀴
3010𓀴“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,
3011𓀴and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old
3012𓀴woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,
3013𓀴a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose
3014𓀴that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a
3015𓀴few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.
3016𓀴James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the
3017𓀴best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and
3018𓀴the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he
3019𓀴heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
3020𓀴
3021𓀴“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the
3022𓀴game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded
3023𓀴round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl
3024𓀴of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of
3025𓀴the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
3026𓀴She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood
3027𓀴and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared
3028𓀴to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using
3029𓀴very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
3030𓀴hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
3031𓀴violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home
3032𓀴that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and
3033𓀴that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said
3034𓀴the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say
3035𓀴that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help
3036𓀴of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his
3037𓀴hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
3038𓀴fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out
3039𓀴upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
3040𓀴blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might
3041𓀴very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which
3042𓀴was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under
3043𓀴these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict
3044𓀴of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he
3045𓀴was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have
3046𓀴referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the
3047𓀴case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”
3048𓀴
3049𓀴“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever
3050𓀴circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”
3051𓀴
3052𓀴“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes
3053𓀴thoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if
3054𓀴you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in
3055𓀴an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It
3056𓀴must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave
3057𓀴against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the
3058𓀴culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and
3059𓀴among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who
3060𓀴believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may
3061𓀴recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case
3062𓀴in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case
3063𓀴to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying
3064𓀴westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their
3065𓀴breakfasts at home.”
3066𓀴
3067𓀴“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will
3068𓀴find little credit to be gained out of this case.”
3069𓀴
3070𓀴“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,
3071𓀴laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
3072𓀴which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me
3073𓀴too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either
3074𓀴confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of
3075𓀴employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,
3076𓀴I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the
3077𓀴right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have
3078𓀴noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”
3079𓀴
3080𓀴“How on earth—”
3081𓀴
3082𓀴“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which
3083𓀴characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you
3084𓀴shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete
3085𓀴as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively
3086𓀴slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear
3087𓀴that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine
3088𓀴a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being
3089𓀴satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of
3090𓀴observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just
3091𓀴possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies
3092𓀴before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
3093𓀴the inquest, and which are worth considering.”
3094𓀴
3095𓀴“What are they?”
3096𓀴
3097𓀴“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the
3098𓀴return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing
3099𓀴him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to
3100𓀴hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of
3101𓀴his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might
3102𓀴have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”
3103𓀴
3104𓀴“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.
3105𓀴
3106𓀴“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”
3107𓀴
3108𓀴“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least
3109𓀴a most suspicious remark.”
3110𓀴
3111𓀴“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can
3112𓀴at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could
3113𓀴not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances
3114𓀴were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own
3115𓀴arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as
3116𓀴highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural
3117𓀴under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to
3118𓀴a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
3119𓀴either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint
3120𓀴and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
3121𓀴unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his
3122𓀴father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far
3123𓀴forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,
3124𓀴according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise
3125𓀴his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which
3126𓀴are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy
3127𓀴mind rather than of a guilty one.”
3128𓀴
3129𓀴I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”
3130𓀴I remarked.
3131𓀴
3132𓀴“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”
3133𓀴
3134𓀴“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”
3135𓀴
3136𓀴“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though
3137𓀴there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find
3138𓀴it here, and may read it for yourself.”
3139𓀴
3140𓀴He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,
3141𓀴and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which
3142𓀴the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had
3143𓀴occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read
3144𓀴it very carefully. It ran in this way:
3145𓀴
3146𓀴“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and
3147𓀴gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at
3148𓀴Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,
3149𓀴the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and
3150𓀴I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John
3151𓀴Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap
3152𓀴in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk
3153𓀴rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he
3154𓀴was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the
3155𓀴Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which
3156𓀴is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the
3157𓀴game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in
3158𓀴thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in
3159𓀴front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of
3160𓀴“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then
3161𓀴hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be
3162𓀴much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was
3163𓀴doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost
3164𓀴to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that
3165𓀴his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards
3166𓀴Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I
3167𓀴heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I
3168𓀴found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly
3169𓀴injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost
3170𓀴instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made
3171𓀴my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to
3172𓀴ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I
3173𓀴have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,
3174𓀴being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far
3175𓀴as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’
3176𓀴
3177𓀴“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
3178𓀴
3179𓀴“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion
3180𓀴to a rat.
3181𓀴
3182𓀴“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
3183𓀴
3184𓀴“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
3185𓀴delirious.
3186𓀴
3187𓀴“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had
3188𓀴this final quarrel?
3189𓀴
3190𓀴“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
3191𓀴
3192𓀴“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
3193𓀴
3194𓀴“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you
3195𓀴that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
3196𓀴
3197𓀴“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to
3198𓀴you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably
3199𓀴in any future proceedings which may arise.
3200𓀴
3201𓀴“Witness: I must still refuse.
3202𓀴
3203𓀴“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal
3204𓀴between you and your father?
3205𓀴
3206𓀴“Witness: It was.
3207𓀴
3208𓀴“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,
3209𓀴and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
3210𓀴
3211𓀴“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
3212𓀴
3213𓀴“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you
3214𓀴returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
3215𓀴
3216𓀴“Witness: Nothing definite.
3217𓀴
3218𓀴“The Coroner: What do you mean?
3219𓀴
3220𓀴“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,
3221𓀴that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague
3222𓀴impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the
3223𓀴left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of
3224𓀴some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked
3225𓀴round for it, but it was gone.
3226𓀴
3227𓀴“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’
3228𓀴
3229𓀴“‘Yes, it was gone.’
3230𓀴
3231𓀴“‘You cannot say what it was?’
3232𓀴
3233𓀴“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’
3234𓀴
3235𓀴“‘How far from the body?’
3236𓀴
3237𓀴“‘A dozen yards or so.’
3238𓀴
3239𓀴“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’
3240𓀴
3241𓀴“‘About the same.’
3242𓀴
3243𓀴“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of
3244𓀴it?’
3245𓀴
3246𓀴“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’
3247𓀴
3248𓀴“This concluded the examination of the witness.”
3249𓀴
3250𓀴“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his
3251𓀴concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls
3252𓀴attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
3253𓀴signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details
3254𓀴of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his
3255𓀴father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against
3256𓀴the son.”
3257𓀴
3258𓀴Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
3259𓀴cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”
3260𓀴said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s
3261𓀴favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having
3262𓀴too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent
3263𓀴a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too
3264𓀴much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so
3265𓀴_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the
3266𓀴vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of
3267𓀴view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither
3268𓀴that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
3269𓀴not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of
3270𓀴action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty
3271𓀴minutes.”
3272𓀴
3273𓀴It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the
3274𓀴beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found
3275𓀴ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,
3276𓀴ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
3277𓀴platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings
3278𓀴which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no
3279𓀴difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove
3280𓀴to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.
3281𓀴
3282𓀴“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.
3283𓀴“I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until
3284𓀴you had been on the scene of the crime.”
3285𓀴
3286𓀴“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is
3287𓀴entirely a question of barometric pressure.”
3288𓀴
3289𓀴Lestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.
3290𓀴
3291𓀴“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the
3292𓀴sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the
3293𓀴sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do
3294𓀴not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”
3295𓀴
3296𓀴Lestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your
3297𓀴conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a
3298𓀴pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,
3299𓀴of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
3300𓀴She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly
3301𓀴told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not
3302𓀴already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”
3303𓀴
3304𓀴He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most
3305𓀴lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes
3306𓀴shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of
3307𓀴her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
3308𓀴
3309𓀴“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of
3310𓀴us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my
3311𓀴companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell
3312𓀴you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to
3313𓀴start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon
3314𓀴that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and
3315𓀴I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
3316𓀴hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”
3317𓀴
3318𓀴“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may
3319𓀴rely upon my doing all that I can.”
3320𓀴
3321𓀴“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do
3322𓀴you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he
3323𓀴is innocent?”
3324𓀴
3325𓀴“I think that it is very probable.”
3326𓀴
3327𓀴“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly
3328𓀴at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”
3329𓀴
3330𓀴Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has
3331𓀴been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.
3332𓀴
3333𓀴“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And
3334𓀴about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he
3335𓀴would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in
3336𓀴it.”
3337𓀴
3338𓀴“In what way?” asked Holmes.
3339𓀴
3340𓀴“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many
3341𓀴disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should
3342𓀴be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as
3343𓀴brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little
3344𓀴of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything
3345𓀴like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of
3346𓀴them.”
3347𓀴
3348𓀴“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”
3349𓀴
3350𓀴“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of
3351𓀴it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one
3352𓀴of his keen, questioning glances at her.
3353𓀴
3354𓀴“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I
3355𓀴call to-morrow?”
3356𓀴
3357𓀴“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”
3358𓀴
3359𓀴“The doctor?”
3360𓀴
3361𓀴“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years
3362𓀴back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,
3363𓀴and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is
3364𓀴shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the
3365𓀴old days in Victoria.”
3366𓀴
3367𓀴“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”
3368𓀴
3369𓀴“Yes, at the mines.”
3370𓀴
3371𓀴“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made
3372𓀴his money.”
3373𓀴
3374𓀴“Yes, certainly.”
3375𓀴
3376𓀴“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”
3377𓀴
3378𓀴“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go
3379𓀴to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that
3380𓀴I know him to be innocent.”
3381𓀴
3382𓀴“I will, Miss Turner.”
3383𓀴
3384𓀴“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I
3385𓀴leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried
3386𓀴from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the
3387𓀴wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
3388𓀴
3389𓀴“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few
3390𓀴minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to
3391𓀴disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”
3392𓀴
3393𓀴“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.
3394𓀴“Have you an order to see him in prison?”
3395𓀴
3396𓀴“Yes, but only for you and me.”
3397𓀴
3398𓀴“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still
3399𓀴time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”
3400𓀴
3401𓀴“Ample.”
3402𓀴
3403𓀴“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but
3404𓀴I shall only be away a couple of hours.”
3405𓀴
3406𓀴I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the
3407𓀴streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay
3408𓀴upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
3409𓀴The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the
3410𓀴deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention
3411𓀴wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung
3412𓀴it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of
3413𓀴the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story
3414𓀴were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
3415𓀴unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the
3416𓀴time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by
3417𓀴his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and
3418𓀴deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal
3419𓀴something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the
3420𓀴weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
3421𓀴In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of
3422𓀴the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
3423𓀴shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon
3424𓀴my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.
3425𓀴That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen
3426𓀴quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go
3427𓀴for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the
3428𓀴blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to
3429𓀴it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could
3430𓀴that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow
3431𓀴does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an
3432𓀴attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I
3433𓀴cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the
3434𓀴incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true
3435𓀴the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
3436𓀴overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and
3437𓀴to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back
3438𓀴turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and
3439𓀴improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s
3440𓀴opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I
3441𓀴could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen
3442𓀴his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.
3443𓀴
3444𓀴It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for
3445𓀴Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
3446𓀴
3447𓀴“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is
3448𓀴of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the
3449𓀴ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest
3450𓀴for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by
3451𓀴a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”
3452𓀴
3453𓀴“And what did you learn from him?”
3454𓀴
3455𓀴“Nothing.”
3456𓀴
3457𓀴“Could he throw no light?”
3458𓀴
3459𓀴“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had
3460𓀴done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is
3461𓀴as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,
3462𓀴though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”
3463𓀴
3464𓀴“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that
3465𓀴he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss
3466𓀴Turner.”
3467𓀴
3468𓀴“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
3469𓀴insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a
3470𓀴lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at
3471𓀴a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of
3472𓀴a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a
3473𓀴word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him
3474𓀴to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,
3475𓀴but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of
3476𓀴this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his
3477𓀴father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
3478𓀴Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and
3479𓀴his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown
3480𓀴him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife
3481𓀴that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did
3482𓀴not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has
3483𓀴come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
3484𓀴that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him
3485𓀴over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband
3486𓀴already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between
3487𓀴them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
3488𓀴that he has suffered.”
3489𓀴
3490𓀴“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”
3491𓀴
3492𓀴“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
3493𓀴One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the
3494𓀴pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was
3495𓀴away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the
3496𓀴murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had
3497𓀴returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And
3498𓀴now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall
3499𓀴leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”
3500𓀴
3501𓀴There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright
3502𓀴and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the
3503𓀴carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
3504𓀴
3505𓀴“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said
3506𓀴that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”
3507𓀴
3508𓀴“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.
3509𓀴
3510𓀴“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
3511𓀴abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business
3512𓀴has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,
3513𓀴and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he
3514𓀴gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”
3515𓀴
3516𓀴“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.
3517𓀴
3518𓀴“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about
3519𓀴here speaks of his kindness to him.”
3520𓀴
3521𓀴“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
3522𓀴McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been
3523𓀴under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son
3524𓀴to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and
3525𓀴that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a
3526𓀴proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we
3527𓀴know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us
3528𓀴as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”
3529𓀴
3530𓀴“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,
3531𓀴winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without
3532𓀴flying away after theories and fancies.”
3533𓀴
3534𓀴“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to
3535𓀴tackle the facts.”
3536𓀴
3537𓀴“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to
3538𓀴get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.
3539𓀴
3540𓀴“And that is—”
3541𓀴
3542𓀴“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all
3543𓀴theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”
3544𓀴
3545𓀴“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.
3546𓀴“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the
3547𓀴left.”
3548𓀴
3549𓀴“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,
3550𓀴two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon
3551𓀴the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
3552𓀴gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay
3553𓀴heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’
3554𓀴request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his
3555𓀴death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had
3556𓀴then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight
3557𓀴different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from
3558𓀴which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
3559𓀴
3560𓀴Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as
3561𓀴this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker
3562𓀴Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and
3563𓀴darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his
3564𓀴eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was
3565𓀴bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins
3566𓀴stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed
3567𓀴to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so
3568𓀴absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or
3569𓀴remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a
3570𓀴quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
3571𓀴along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the
3572𓀴woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that
3573𓀴district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and
3574𓀴amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes
3575𓀴would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little
3576𓀴detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective
3577𓀴indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the
3578𓀴interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions
3579𓀴was directed towards a definite end.
3580𓀴
3581𓀴The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some
3582𓀴fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley
3583𓀴Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods
3584𓀴which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting
3585𓀴pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On
3586𓀴the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was
3587𓀴a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of
3588𓀴the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the
3589𓀴exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was
3590𓀴the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by
3591𓀴the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
3592𓀴face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the
3593𓀴trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and
3594𓀴then turned upon my companion.
3595𓀴
3596𓀴“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.
3597𓀴
3598𓀴“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or
3599𓀴other trace. But how on earth—”
3600𓀴
3601𓀴“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward
3602𓀴twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it
3603𓀴vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I
3604𓀴been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over
3605𓀴it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have
3606𓀴covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are
3607𓀴three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay
3608𓀴down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time
3609𓀴rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice
3610𓀴he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply
3611𓀴marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran
3612𓀴when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet
3613𓀴as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the
3614𓀴gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?
3615𓀴Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,
3616𓀴they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they
3617𓀴come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the
3618𓀴track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the
3619𓀴shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes
3620𓀴traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
3621𓀴his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained
3622𓀴there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what
3623𓀴seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens
3624𓀴not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could
3625𓀴reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he
3626𓀴carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the
3627𓀴wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.
3628𓀴
3629𓀴“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning
3630𓀴to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must
3631𓀴be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and
3632𓀴perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our
3633𓀴luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”
3634𓀴
3635𓀴It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into
3636𓀴Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up
3637𓀴in the wood.
3638𓀴
3639𓀴“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The
3640𓀴murder was done with it.”
3641𓀴
3642𓀴“I see no marks.”
3643𓀴
3644𓀴“There are none.”
3645𓀴
3646𓀴“How do you know, then?”
3647𓀴
3648𓀴“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.
3649𓀴There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds
3650𓀴with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”
3651𓀴
3652𓀴“And the murderer?”
3653𓀴
3654𓀴“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
3655𓀴thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses
3656𓀴a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are
3657𓀴several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our
3658𓀴search.”
3659𓀴
3660𓀴Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.
3661𓀴“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed
3662𓀴British jury.”
3663𓀴
3664𓀴“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own method,
3665𓀴and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall
3666𓀴probably return to London by the evening train.”
3667𓀴
3668𓀴“And leave your case unfinished?”
3669𓀴
3670𓀴“No, finished.”
3671𓀴
3672𓀴“But the mystery?”
3673𓀴
3674𓀴“It is solved.”
3675𓀴
3676𓀴“Who was the criminal, then?”
3677𓀴
3678𓀴“The gentleman I describe.”
3679𓀴
3680𓀴“But who is he?”
3681𓀴
3682𓀴“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
3683𓀴populous neighbourhood.”
3684𓀴
3685𓀴Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and
3686𓀴I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a
3687𓀴left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
3688𓀴laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”
3689𓀴
3690𓀴“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here
3691𓀴are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”
3692𓀴
3693𓀴Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we
3694𓀴found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought
3695𓀴with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a
3696𓀴perplexing position.
3697𓀴
3698𓀴“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down
3699𓀴in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite
3700𓀴what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me
3701𓀴expound.”
3702𓀴
3703𓀴 “Pray do so.”
3704𓀴
3705𓀴“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young
3706𓀴McCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they
3707𓀴impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that
3708𓀴his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing
3709𓀴him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled
3710𓀴several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s
3711𓀴ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will
3712𓀴begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”
3713𓀴
3714𓀴“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”
3715𓀴
3716𓀴“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as
3717𓀴far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within
3718𓀴earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it
3719𓀴was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly
3720𓀴Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a
3721𓀴strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him
3722𓀴at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”
3723𓀴
3724𓀴“What of the rat, then?”
3725𓀴
3726𓀴Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it
3727𓀴out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said.
3728𓀴“I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of
3729𓀴the map. “What do you read?”
3730𓀴
3731𓀴“ARAT,” I read.
3732𓀴
3733𓀴“And now?” He raised his hand.
3734𓀴
3735𓀴“BALLARAT.”
3736𓀴
3737𓀴“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only
3738𓀴caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his
3739𓀴murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”
3740𓀴
3741𓀴“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.
3742𓀴
3743𓀴“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
3744𓀴considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,
3745𓀴granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have
3746𓀴come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an
3747𓀴Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.”
3748𓀴
3749𓀴“Certainly.”
3750𓀴
3751𓀴“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be
3752𓀴approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly
3753𓀴wander.”
3754𓀴
3755𓀴“Quite so.”
3756𓀴
3757𓀴“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I
3758𓀴gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as
3759𓀴to the personality of the criminal.”
3760𓀴
3761𓀴“But how did you gain them?”
3762𓀴
3763𓀴“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”
3764𓀴
3765𓀴“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his
3766𓀴stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”
3767𓀴
3768𓀴“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”
3769𓀴
3770𓀴“But his lameness?”
3771𓀴
3772𓀴“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his
3773𓀴left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”
3774𓀴
3775𓀴“But his left-handedness.”
3776𓀴
3777𓀴“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by
3778𓀴the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately
3779𓀴behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it
3780𓀴were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the
3781𓀴interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found
3782𓀴the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables
3783𓀴me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some
3784𓀴attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140
3785𓀴different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found
3786𓀴the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
3787𓀴where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which
3788𓀴are rolled in Rotterdam.”
3789𓀴
3790𓀴“And the cigar-holder?”
3791𓀴
3792𓀴“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used
3793𓀴a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not
3794𓀴a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”
3795𓀴
3796𓀴“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he
3797𓀴cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if
3798𓀴you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in
3799𓀴which all this points. The culprit is—”
3800𓀴
3801𓀴“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our
3802𓀴sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
3803𓀴
3804𓀴The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,
3805𓀴limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,
3806𓀴and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs
3807𓀴showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of
3808𓀴character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping
3809𓀴eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his
3810𓀴appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the
3811𓀴corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear
3812𓀴to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic
3813𓀴disease.
3814𓀴
3815𓀴“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”
3816𓀴
3817𓀴“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see
3818𓀴me here to avoid scandal.”
3819𓀴
3820𓀴“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”
3821𓀴
3822𓀴“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with
3823𓀴despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
3824𓀴
3825𓀴“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is
3826𓀴so. I know all about McCarthy.”
3827𓀴
3828𓀴The old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I
3829𓀴would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that
3830𓀴I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”
3831𓀴
3832𓀴“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.
3833𓀴
3834𓀴“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would
3835𓀴break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am
3836𓀴arrested.”
3837𓀴
3838𓀴“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.
3839𓀴
3840𓀴“What?”
3841𓀴
3842𓀴“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who
3843𓀴required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young
3844𓀴McCarthy must be got off, however.”
3845𓀴
3846𓀴“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My
3847𓀴doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would
3848𓀴rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”
3849𓀴
3850𓀴Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a
3851𓀴bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall
3852𓀴jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.
3853𓀴Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save
3854𓀴young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is
3855𓀴absolutely needed.”
3856𓀴
3857𓀴“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live
3858𓀴to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare
3859𓀴Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has
3860𓀴been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
3861𓀴
3862𓀴“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I
3863𓀴tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
3864𓀴His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my
3865𓀴life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
3866𓀴
3867𓀴“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,
3868𓀴hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got
3869𓀴among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to
3870𓀴the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway
3871𓀴robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,
3872𓀴sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the
3873𓀴road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,
3874𓀴and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
3875𓀴
3876𓀴“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay
3877𓀴in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,
3878𓀴so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the
3879𓀴first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the
3880𓀴swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this
3881𓀴very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I
3882𓀴spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as
3883𓀴though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became
3884𓀴wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.
3885𓀴There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a
3886𓀴quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be
3887𓀴in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to
3888𓀴make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and
3889𓀴though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when
3890𓀴she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path
3891𓀴as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and
3892𓀴did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy
3893𓀴laid his grip upon me.
3894𓀴
3895𓀴“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent
3896𓀴Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
3897𓀴
3898𓀴“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as
3899𓀴good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can
3900𓀴have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country
3901𓀴is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’
3902𓀴
3903𓀴“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them
3904𓀴off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
3905𓀴There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I
3906𓀴would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse
3907𓀴as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my
3908𓀴past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever
3909𓀴it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last
3910𓀴he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
3911𓀴
3912𓀴“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known
3913𓀴to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad
3914𓀴should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not
3915𓀴have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to
3916𓀴the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.
3917𓀴McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at
3918𓀴the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
3919𓀴
3920𓀴“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a
3921𓀴cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I
3922𓀴listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come
3923𓀴uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little
3924𓀴regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the
3925𓀴streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear
3926𓀴should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the
3927𓀴bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind
3928𓀴and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my
3929𓀴memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that
3930𓀴foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I
3931𓀴have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that
3932𓀴my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
3933𓀴than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if
3934𓀴he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;
3935𓀴but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back
3936𓀴to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true
3937𓀴story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”
3938𓀴
3939𓀴“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man
3940𓀴signed the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may
3941𓀴never be exposed to such a temptation.”
3942𓀴
3943𓀴“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”
3944𓀴
3945𓀴“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will
3946𓀴soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I
3947𓀴will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be
3948𓀴forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and
3949𓀴your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”
3950𓀴
3951𓀴“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when
3952𓀴they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you
3953𓀴have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he
3954𓀴stumbled slowly from the room.
3955𓀴
3956𓀴“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play
3957𓀴such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as
3958𓀴this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for
3959𓀴the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”
3960𓀴
3961𓀴James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number
3962𓀴of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the
3963𓀴defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our
3964𓀴interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son
3965𓀴and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the
3966𓀴black cloud which rests upon their past.
3967𓀴
3968𓀴
3969𓀴
3970𓀴
3971𓀴V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
3972𓀴
3973𓀴
3974𓀴When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases
3975𓀴between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present
3976𓀴strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
3977𓀴which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained
3978𓀴publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for
3979𓀴those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,
3980𓀴and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,
3981𓀴have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
3982𓀴beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
3983𓀴cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
3984𓀴and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
3985𓀴him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
3986𓀴its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give
3987𓀴some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in
3988𓀴connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
3989𓀴entirely cleared up.
3990𓀴
3991𓀴The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or
3992𓀴less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under
3993𓀴this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the
3994𓀴Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious
3995𓀴club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
3996𓀴connected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the
3997𓀴singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and
3998𓀴finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be
3999𓀴remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s
4000𓀴watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
4001𓀴therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction
4002𓀴which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these
4003𓀴I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
4004𓀴singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have
4005𓀴now taken up my pen to describe.
4006𓀴
4007𓀴It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had
4008𓀴set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the
4009𓀴rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of
4010𓀴great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the
4011𓀴instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
4012𓀴great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his
4013𓀴civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the
4014𓀴storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
4015𓀴child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
4016𓀴fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was
4017𓀴deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the
4018𓀴gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
4019𓀴rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was
4020𓀴on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once
4021𓀴more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
4022𓀴
4023𓀴“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell.
4024𓀴Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”
4025𓀴
4026𓀴“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage
4027𓀴visitors.”
4028𓀴
4029𓀴“A client, then?”
4030𓀴
4031𓀴“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
4032𓀴such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to
4033𓀴be some crony of the landlady’s.”
4034𓀴
4035𓀴Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a
4036𓀴step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his
4037𓀴long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
4038𓀴chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
4039𓀴
4040𓀴“Come in!” said he.
4041𓀴
4042𓀴The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
4043𓀴well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
4044𓀴in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
4045𓀴his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
4046𓀴had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I
4047𓀴could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
4048𓀴man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
4049𓀴
4050𓀴“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his
4051𓀴eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some
4052𓀴traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”
4053𓀴
4054𓀴“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on
4055𓀴the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
4056𓀴south-west, I see.”
4057𓀴
4058𓀴“Yes, from Horsham.”
4059𓀴
4060𓀴“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite
4061𓀴distinctive.”
4062𓀴
4063𓀴“I have come for advice.”
4064𓀴
4065𓀴“That is easily got.”
4066𓀴
4067𓀴“And help.”
4068𓀴
4069𓀴“That is not always so easy.”
4070𓀴
4071𓀴“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how
4072𓀴you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”
4073𓀴
4074𓀴“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”
4075𓀴
4076𓀴“He said that you could solve anything.”
4077𓀴
4078𓀴“He said too much.”
4079𓀴
4080𓀴“That you are never beaten.”
4081𓀴
4082𓀴“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a
4083𓀴woman.”
4084𓀴
4085𓀴“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”
4086𓀴
4087𓀴“It is true that I have been generally successful.”
4088𓀴
4089𓀴“Then you may be so with me.”
4090𓀴
4091𓀴“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with
4092𓀴some details as to your case.”
4093𓀴
4094𓀴“It is no ordinary one.”
4095𓀴
4096𓀴“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”
4097𓀴
4098𓀴“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
4099𓀴ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
4100𓀴than those which have happened in my own family.”
4101𓀴
4102𓀴“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential
4103𓀴facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
4104𓀴those details which seem to me to be most important.”
4105𓀴
4106𓀴The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
4107𓀴the blaze.
4108𓀴
4109𓀴“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far
4110𓀴as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a
4111𓀴hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must
4112𓀴go back to the commencement of the affair.
4113𓀴
4114𓀴“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my
4115𓀴father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he
4116𓀴enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee
4117𓀴of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such
4118𓀴success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome
4119𓀴competence.
4120𓀴
4121𓀴“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became
4122𓀴a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At
4123𓀴the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under
4124𓀴Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my
4125𓀴uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four
4126𓀴years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small
4127𓀴estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune
4128𓀴in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the
4129𓀴negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the
4130𓀴franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,
4131𓀴very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
4132𓀴disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if
4133𓀴ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields
4134𓀴round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very
4135𓀴often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great
4136𓀴deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and
4137𓀴did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
4138𓀴
4139𓀴“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time
4140𓀴when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be
4141𓀴in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He
4142𓀴begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in
4143𓀴his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and
4144𓀴draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the
4145𓀴servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was
4146𓀴sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could
4147𓀴go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him
4148𓀴in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a
4149𓀴single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
4150𓀴locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to
4151𓀴enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I
4152𓀴was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and
4153𓀴bundles as would be expected in such a room.
4154𓀴
4155𓀴“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon
4156𓀴the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing
4157𓀴for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,
4158𓀴and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it
4159𓀴up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out
4160𓀴there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon
4161𓀴his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my
4162𓀴lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were
4163𓀴protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope
4164𓀴which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and
4165𓀴then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’
4166𓀴
4167𓀴“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.
4168𓀴
4169𓀴“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,
4170𓀴leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw
4171𓀴scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter
4172𓀴K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried
4173𓀴pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the
4174𓀴breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with
4175𓀴an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,
4176𓀴and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
4177𓀴
4178𓀴“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he
4179𓀴with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,
4180𓀴and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’
4181𓀴
4182𓀴“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step
4183𓀴up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there
4184𓀴was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass
4185𓀴box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,
4186𓀴with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had
4187𓀴read in the morning upon the envelope.
4188𓀴
4189𓀴“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my
4190𓀴estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my
4191𓀴brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you
4192𓀴can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my
4193𓀴advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to
4194𓀴give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are
4195𓀴going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’
4196𓀴
4197𓀴“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
4198𓀴The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression
4199𓀴upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind
4200𓀴without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off
4201𓀴the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation
4202𓀴grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the
4203𓀴usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.
4204𓀴He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of
4205𓀴society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door
4206𓀴locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of
4207𓀴drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the
4208𓀴garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of
4209𓀴no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
4210𓀴man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
4211𓀴tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man
4212𓀴who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the
4213𓀴roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold
4214𓀴day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
4215𓀴
4216𓀴“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse
4217𓀴your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
4218𓀴sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to
4219𓀴search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
4220𓀴at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the
4221𓀴water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
4222𓀴known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew
4223𓀴how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
4224𓀴myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
4225𓀴however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of
4226𓀴some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”
4227𓀴
4228𓀴“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of
4229𓀴the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date
4230𓀴of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his
4231𓀴supposed suicide.”
4232𓀴
4233𓀴“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,
4234𓀴upon the night of May 2nd.”
4235𓀴
4236𓀴“Thank you. Pray proceed.”
4237𓀴
4238𓀴“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made
4239𓀴a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We
4240𓀴found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On
4241𓀴the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.
4242𓀴K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’
4243𓀴written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers
4244𓀴which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
4245𓀴nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered
4246𓀴papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of
4247𓀴them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and
4248𓀴had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during
4249𓀴the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned
4250𓀴with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the
4251𓀴carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
4252𓀴
4253𓀴“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at
4254𓀴Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of
4255𓀴’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a
4256𓀴sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There
4257𓀴he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
4258𓀴orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always
4259𓀴laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but
4260𓀴he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
4261𓀴himself.
4262𓀴
4263𓀴“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.
4264𓀴
4265𓀴“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.
4266𓀴
4267𓀴“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the
4268𓀴very letters. But what is this written above them?’
4269𓀴
4270𓀴“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.
4271𓀴
4272𓀴“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.
4273𓀴
4274𓀴“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the
4275𓀴papers must be those that are destroyed.’
4276𓀴
4277𓀴“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised
4278𓀴land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the
4279𓀴thing come from?’
4280𓀴
4281𓀴“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.
4282𓀴
4283𓀴“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with
4284𓀴sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’
4285𓀴
4286𓀴“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.
4287𓀴
4288𓀴“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’
4289𓀴
4290𓀴“‘Then let me do so?’
4291𓀴
4292𓀴“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’
4293𓀴
4294𓀴“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I
4295𓀴went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
4296𓀴
4297𓀴“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from
4298𓀴home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command
4299𓀴of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,
4300𓀴for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
4301𓀴from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his
4302𓀴absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at
4303𓀴once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
4304𓀴in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
4305𓀴I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
4306𓀴consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in
4307𓀴the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
4308𓀴unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death
4309𓀴from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected
4310𓀴with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
4311𓀴idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
4312𓀴robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And
4313𓀴yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
4314𓀴was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
4315𓀴
4316𓀴“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I
4317𓀴did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our
4318𓀴troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s
4319𓀴life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
4320𓀴another.
4321𓀴
4322𓀴“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years
4323𓀴and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
4324𓀴happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed
4325𓀴away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I
4326𓀴had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow
4327𓀴fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”
4328𓀴
4329𓀴The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning
4330𓀴to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
4331𓀴
4332𓀴“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern
4333𓀴division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last
4334𓀴message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”
4335𓀴
4336𓀴“What have you done?” asked Holmes.
4337𓀴
4338𓀴“Nothing.”
4339𓀴
4340𓀴“Nothing?”
4341𓀴
4342𓀴“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have
4343𓀴felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
4344𓀴snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
4345𓀴resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
4346𓀴guard against.”
4347𓀴
4348𓀴“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.
4349𓀴Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”
4350𓀴
4351𓀴“I have seen the police.”
4352𓀴
4353𓀴“Ah!”
4354𓀴
4355𓀴“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
4356𓀴inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
4357𓀴jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
4358𓀴the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”
4359𓀴
4360𓀴Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he
4361𓀴cried.
4362𓀴
4363𓀴“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
4364𓀴house with me.”
4365𓀴
4366𓀴“Has he come with you to-night?”
4367𓀴
4368𓀴“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”
4369𓀴
4370𓀴Again Holmes raved in the air.
4371𓀴
4372𓀴“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not
4373𓀴come at once?”
4374𓀴
4375𓀴“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
4376𓀴about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”
4377𓀴
4378𓀴“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
4379𓀴before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which
4380𓀴you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”
4381𓀴
4382𓀴“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
4383𓀴pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he
4384𓀴laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that
4385𓀴on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,
4386𓀴unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
4387𓀴colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am
4388𓀴inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
4389𓀴fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped
4390𓀴destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us
4391𓀴much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The
4392𓀴writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”
4393𓀴
4394𓀴Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
4395𓀴showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
4396𓀴was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical
4397𓀴notices:
4398𓀴
4399𓀴“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
4400𓀴
4401𓀴“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.
4402𓀴Augustine.
4403𓀴
4404𓀴“9th. McCauley cleared.
4405𓀴
4406𓀴“10th. John Swain cleared.
4407𓀴
4408𓀴“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”
4409𓀴
4410𓀴“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our
4411𓀴visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
4412𓀴cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
4413𓀴home instantly and act.”
4414𓀴
4415𓀴“What shall I do?”
4416𓀴
4417𓀴“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put
4418𓀴this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
4419𓀴you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the
4420𓀴other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one
4421𓀴which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry
4422𓀴conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box
4423𓀴out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”
4424𓀴
4425𓀴“Entirely.”
4426𓀴
4427𓀴“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
4428𓀴that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
4429𓀴weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to
4430𓀴remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear
4431𓀴up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”
4432𓀴
4433𓀴“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
4434𓀴“You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you
4435𓀴advise.”
4436𓀴
4437𓀴“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the
4438𓀴meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
4439𓀴threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”
4440𓀴
4441𓀴“By train from Waterloo.”
4442𓀴
4443𓀴“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you
4444𓀴may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”
4445𓀴
4446𓀴“I am armed.”
4447𓀴
4448𓀴“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”
4449𓀴
4450𓀴“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”
4451𓀴
4452𓀴“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”
4453𓀴
4454𓀴“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
4455𓀴the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.”
4456𓀴He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still
4457𓀴screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This
4458𓀴strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
4459𓀴elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to
4460𓀴have been reabsorbed by them once more.
4461𓀴
4462𓀴Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
4463𓀴forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
4464𓀴his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
4465𓀴as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
4466𓀴
4467𓀴“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have
4468𓀴had none more fantastic than this.”
4469𓀴
4470𓀴“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”
4471𓀴
4472𓀴“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me
4473𓀴to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”
4474𓀴
4475𓀴“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what
4476𓀴these perils are?”
4477𓀴
4478𓀴“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.
4479𓀴
4480𓀴“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this
4481𓀴unhappy family?”
4482𓀴
4483𓀴Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of
4484𓀴his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he
4485𓀴remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its
4486𓀴bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up
4487𓀴to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier
4488𓀴could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a
4489𓀴single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in
4490𓀴a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other
4491𓀴ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which
4492𓀴the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
4493𓀴which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of
4494𓀴their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is
4495𓀴necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
4496𓀴which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you
4497𓀴will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these
4498𓀴days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare
4499𓀴accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should
4500𓀴possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
4501𓀴and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,
4502𓀴you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my
4503𓀴limits in a very precise fashion.”
4504𓀴
4505𓀴“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy,
4506𓀴astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany
4507𓀴variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
4508𓀴within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
4509𓀴sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
4510𓀴swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I
4511𓀴think, were the main points of my analysis.”
4512𓀴
4513𓀴Holmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said
4514𓀴then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
4515𓀴the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in
4516𓀴the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
4517𓀴Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
4518𓀴to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me
4519𓀴down the letter K of the _American Encyclopædia_ which stands upon the
4520𓀴shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see
4521𓀴what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a
4522𓀴strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason
4523𓀴for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
4524𓀴habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the
4525𓀴lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude
4526𓀴in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
4527𓀴something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of
4528𓀴someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he
4529𓀴feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters
4530𓀴which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the
4531𓀴postmarks of those letters?”
4532𓀴
4533𓀴“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third
4534𓀴from London.”
4535𓀴
4536𓀴“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”
4537𓀴
4538𓀴“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”
4539𓀴
4540𓀴“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the
4541𓀴probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a
4542𓀴ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
4543𓀴Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
4544𓀴in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest
4545𓀴anything?”
4546𓀴
4547𓀴“A greater distance to travel.”
4548𓀴
4549𓀴“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”
4550𓀴
4551𓀴“Then I do not see the point.”
4552𓀴
4553𓀴“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or
4554𓀴men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their
4555𓀴singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
4556𓀴You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
4557𓀴Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have
4558𓀴arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven
4559𓀴weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the
4560𓀴difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the
4561𓀴sailing vessel which brought the writer.”
4562𓀴
4563𓀴“It is possible.”
4564𓀴
4565𓀴“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of
4566𓀴this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has
4567𓀴always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
4568𓀴travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we
4569𓀴cannot count upon delay.”
4570𓀴
4571𓀴“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”
4572𓀴
4573𓀴“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to
4574𓀴the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite
4575𓀴clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not
4576𓀴have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s
4577𓀴jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men
4578𓀴of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the
4579𓀴holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be
4580𓀴the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”
4581𓀴
4582𓀴“But of what society?”
4583𓀴
4584𓀴“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his
4585𓀴voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”
4586𓀴
4587𓀴“I never have.”
4588𓀴
4589𓀴Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,”
4590𓀴said he presently:
4591𓀴
4592𓀴“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
4593𓀴sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
4594𓀴formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the
4595𓀴Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of
4596𓀴the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,
4597𓀴and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for
4598𓀴the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from
4599𓀴the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were
4600𓀴usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
4601𓀴but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,
4602𓀴melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim
4603𓀴might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the
4604𓀴country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon
4605𓀴him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was
4606𓀴the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
4607𓀴there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving
4608𓀴it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to
4609𓀴the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
4610𓀴of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
4611𓀴classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,
4612𓀴the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been
4613𓀴sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’
4614𓀴
4615𓀴“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the
4616𓀴sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
4617𓀴of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause
4618𓀴and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
4619𓀴more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this
4620𓀴register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,
4621𓀴and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
4622𓀴recovered.”
4623𓀴
4624𓀴“Then the page we have seen—”
4625𓀴
4626𓀴“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the
4627𓀴pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then
4628𓀴there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,
4629𓀴and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.
4630𓀴Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,
4631𓀴and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime
4632𓀴is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to
4633𓀴be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
4634𓀴for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
4635𓀴ways of our fellow men.”
4636𓀴
4637𓀴It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
4638𓀴brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
4639𓀴Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
4640𓀴
4641𓀴“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I
4642𓀴foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
4643𓀴Openshaw’s.”
4644𓀴
4645𓀴“What steps will you take?” I asked.
4646𓀴
4647𓀴“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may
4648𓀴have to go down to Horsham, after all.”
4649𓀴
4650𓀴“You will not go there first?”
4651𓀴
4652𓀴“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid
4653𓀴will bring up your coffee.”
4654𓀴
4655𓀴As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
4656𓀴my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my
4657𓀴heart.
4658𓀴
4659𓀴“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”
4660𓀴
4661𓀴“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it
4662𓀴done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
4663𓀴
4664𓀴“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near
4665𓀴Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:
4666𓀴
4667𓀴“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
4668𓀴Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a
4669𓀴splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,
4670𓀴so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite
4671𓀴impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by
4672𓀴the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It
4673𓀴proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from
4674𓀴an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose
4675𓀴residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been
4676𓀴hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that
4677𓀴in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
4678𓀴over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
4679𓀴The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt
4680𓀴that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which
4681𓀴should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to
4682𓀴the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”
4683𓀴
4684𓀴We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken
4685𓀴than I had ever seen him.
4686𓀴
4687𓀴“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling,
4688𓀴no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me
4689𓀴now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.
4690𓀴That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to
4691𓀴his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in
4692𓀴uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a
4693𓀴nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
4694𓀴
4695𓀴“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they
4696𓀴have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line
4697𓀴to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
4698𓀴night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in
4699𓀴the long run. I am going out now!”
4700𓀴
4701𓀴“To the police?”
4702𓀴
4703𓀴“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
4704𓀴the flies, but not before.”
4705𓀴
4706𓀴All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
4707𓀴evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come
4708𓀴back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and
4709𓀴worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf
4710𓀴he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
4711𓀴water.
4712𓀴
4713𓀴“You are hungry,” I remarked.
4714𓀴
4715𓀴“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
4716𓀴breakfast.”
4717𓀴
4718𓀴“Nothing?”
4719𓀴
4720𓀴“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”
4721𓀴
4722𓀴“And how have you succeeded?”
4723𓀴
4724𓀴“Well.”
4725𓀴
4726𓀴“You have a clue?”
4727𓀴
4728𓀴“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long
4729𓀴remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
4730𓀴upon them. It is well thought of!”
4731𓀴
4732𓀴“What do you mean?”
4733𓀴
4734𓀴He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
4735𓀴squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust
4736𓀴them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.
4737𓀴O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun,
4738𓀴Barque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.”
4739𓀴
4740𓀴“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may
4741𓀴give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his
4742𓀴fate as Openshaw did before him.”
4743𓀴
4744𓀴“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”
4745𓀴
4746𓀴“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”
4747𓀴
4748𓀴“How did you trace it, then?”
4749𓀴
4750𓀴He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
4751𓀴and names.
4752𓀴
4753𓀴“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and
4754𓀴files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
4755𓀴which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were
4756𓀴thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those
4757𓀴months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my
4758𓀴attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
4759𓀴London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the
4760𓀴Union.”
4761𓀴
4762𓀴“Texas, I think.”
4763𓀴
4764𓀴“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an
4765𓀴American origin.”
4766𓀴
4767𓀴“What then?”
4768𓀴
4769𓀴“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone
4770𓀴Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I
4771𓀴then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
4772𓀴London.”
4773𓀴
4774𓀴“Yes?”
4775𓀴
4776𓀴“The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert
4777𓀴Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide
4778𓀴this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and
4779𓀴learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
4780𓀴I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from
4781𓀴the Isle of Wight.”
4782𓀴
4783𓀴“What will you do, then?”
4784𓀴
4785𓀴“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the
4786𓀴only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and
4787𓀴Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
4788𓀴night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By
4789𓀴the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will
4790𓀴have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
4791𓀴of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
4792𓀴charge of murder.”
4793𓀴
4794𓀴There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the
4795𓀴murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which
4796𓀴would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,
4797𓀴was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial
4798𓀴gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of
4799𓀴Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere
4800𓀴far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen
4801𓀴swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon
4802𓀴it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone
4803𓀴Star_.
4804𓀴
4805𓀴
4806𓀴
4807𓀴
4808𓀴VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
4809𓀴
4810𓀴
4811𓀴Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the
4812𓀴Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The
4813𓀴habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he
4814𓀴was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams
4815𓀴and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
4816𓀴to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that
4817𓀴the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
4818𓀴he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
4819𓀴pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,
4820𓀴pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
4821𓀴chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
4822𓀴
4823𓀴One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the
4824𓀴hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up
4825𓀴in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
4826𓀴a little face of disappointment.
4827𓀴
4828𓀴“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”
4829𓀴
4830𓀴I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
4831𓀴
4832𓀴We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon
4833𓀴the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some
4834𓀴dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
4835𓀴
4836𓀴“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly
4837𓀴losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
4838𓀴wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!”
4839𓀴she cried; “I do so want a little help.”
4840𓀴
4841𓀴“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you
4842𓀴startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”
4843𓀴
4844𓀴“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always
4845𓀴the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
4846𓀴lighthouse.
4847𓀴
4848𓀴“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and
4849𓀴water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you
4850𓀴rather that I sent James off to bed?”
4851𓀴
4852𓀴“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.
4853𓀴He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”
4854𓀴
4855𓀴It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s
4856𓀴trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school
4857𓀴companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
4858𓀴Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring
4859𓀴him back to her?
4860𓀴
4861𓀴It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he
4862𓀴had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
4863𓀴east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
4864𓀴day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But
4865𓀴now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
4866𓀴there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
4867𓀴or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of
4868𓀴it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?
4869𓀴How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
4870𓀴and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
4871𓀴
4872𓀴There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
4873𓀴Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
4874𓀴why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as
4875𓀴such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were
4876𓀴alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab
4877𓀴within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given
4878𓀴me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery
4879𓀴sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
4880𓀴strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
4881𓀴could show how strange it was to be.
4882𓀴
4883𓀴But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
4884𓀴Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
4885𓀴which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
4886𓀴Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
4887𓀴steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
4888𓀴den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down
4889𓀴the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
4890𓀴feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found
4891𓀴the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with
4892𓀴the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
4893𓀴forecastle of an emigrant ship.
4894𓀴
4895𓀴Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
4896𓀴strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown
4897𓀴back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
4898𓀴lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows
4899𓀴there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as
4900𓀴the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The
4901𓀴most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked
4902𓀴together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming
4903𓀴in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling
4904𓀴out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
4905𓀴neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,
4906𓀴beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
4907𓀴man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
4908𓀴knees, staring into the fire.
4909𓀴
4910𓀴As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
4911𓀴me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
4912𓀴
4913𓀴“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of
4914𓀴mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”
4915𓀴
4916𓀴There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering
4917𓀴through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
4918𓀴out at me.
4919𓀴
4920𓀴“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,
4921𓀴with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”
4922𓀴
4923𓀴“Nearly eleven.”
4924𓀴
4925𓀴“Of what day?”
4926𓀴
4927𓀴“Of Friday, June 19th.”
4928𓀴
4929𓀴“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you
4930𓀴want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began
4931𓀴to sob in a high treble key.
4932𓀴
4933𓀴“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two
4934𓀴days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”
4935𓀴
4936𓀴“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few
4937𓀴hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with
4938𓀴you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have
4939𓀴you a cab?”
4940𓀴
4941𓀴“Yes, I have one waiting.”
4942𓀴
4943𓀴“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,
4944𓀴Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”
4945𓀴
4946𓀴I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
4947𓀴holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
4948𓀴and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by
4949𓀴the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
4950𓀴whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell
4951𓀴quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come
4952𓀴from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,
4953𓀴very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
4954𓀴from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
4955𓀴from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
4956𓀴my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
4957𓀴astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.
4958𓀴His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
4959𓀴regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my
4960𓀴surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion
4961𓀴to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round
4962𓀴to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
4963𓀴senility.
4964𓀴
4965𓀴“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”
4966𓀴
4967𓀴“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would
4968𓀴have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I
4969𓀴should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”
4970𓀴
4971𓀴“I have a cab outside.”
4972𓀴
4973𓀴“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
4974𓀴appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you
4975𓀴also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
4976𓀴thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with
4977𓀴you in five minutes.”
4978𓀴
4979𓀴It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they
4980𓀴were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
4981𓀴air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in
4982𓀴the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I
4983𓀴could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in
4984𓀴one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his
4985𓀴existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill,
4986𓀴led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
4987𓀴very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I
4988𓀴was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he
4989𓀴shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing
4990𓀴quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit
4991𓀴of laughter.
4992𓀴
4993𓀴“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added
4994𓀴opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
4995𓀴weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”
4996𓀴
4997𓀴“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”
4998𓀴
4999𓀴“But not more so than I to find you.”
5000𓀴
5001𓀴“I came to find a friend.”
5002𓀴
5003𓀴“And I to find an enemy.”
5004𓀴
5005𓀴“An enemy?”
5006𓀴
5007𓀴“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
5008𓀴Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I
5009𓀴have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
5010𓀴I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would
5011𓀴not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now
5012𓀴for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to
5013𓀴have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
5014𓀴building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some
5015𓀴strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”
5016𓀴
5017𓀴“What! You do not mean bodies?”
5018𓀴
5019𓀴“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every
5020𓀴poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest
5021𓀴murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair
5022𓀴has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He
5023𓀴put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal
5024𓀴which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
5025𓀴shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.
5026𓀴
5027𓀴“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
5028𓀴gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
5029𓀴lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”
5030𓀴
5031𓀴“If I can be of use.”
5032𓀴
5033𓀴“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
5034𓀴My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”
5035𓀴
5036𓀴“The Cedars?”
5037𓀴
5038𓀴“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct
5039𓀴the inquiry.”
5040𓀴
5041𓀴“Where is it, then?”
5042𓀴
5043𓀴“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”
5044𓀴
5045𓀴“But I am all in the dark.”
5046𓀴
5047𓀴“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.
5048𓀴All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out
5049𓀴for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”
5050𓀴
5051𓀴He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
5052𓀴endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
5053𓀴gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
5054𓀴the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull
5055𓀴wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
5056𓀴regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
5057𓀴belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
5058𓀴sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
5059𓀴of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
5060𓀴breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside
5061𓀴him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
5062𓀴his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
5063𓀴his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to
5064𓀴the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
5065𓀴shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
5066𓀴has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
5067𓀴
5068𓀴“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you
5069𓀴quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for
5070𓀴me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
5071𓀴over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little
5072𓀴woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”
5073𓀴
5074𓀴“You forget that I know nothing about it.”
5075𓀴
5076𓀴“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
5077𓀴to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to
5078𓀴go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of
5079𓀴it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,
5080𓀴Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”
5081𓀴
5082𓀴“Proceed, then.”
5083𓀴
5084𓀴“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a
5085𓀴gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of
5086𓀴money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and
5087𓀴lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the
5088𓀴neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,
5089𓀴by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was
5090𓀴interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the
5091𓀴morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.
5092𓀴Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a
5093𓀴good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with
5094𓀴all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
5095𓀴as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while
5096𓀴he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
5097𓀴There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
5098𓀴weighing upon his mind.
5099𓀴
5100𓀴“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than
5101𓀴usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
5102𓀴commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
5103𓀴box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
5104𓀴upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect
5105𓀴that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting
5106𓀴was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
5107𓀴Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office
5108𓀴of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam
5109𓀴Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,
5110𓀴started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s
5111𓀴office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking
5112𓀴through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed
5113𓀴me so far?”
5114𓀴
5115𓀴“It is very clear.”
5116𓀴
5117𓀴“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair
5118𓀴walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did
5119𓀴not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was
5120𓀴walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an
5121𓀴ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down
5122𓀴at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor
5123𓀴window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she
5124𓀴describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to
5125𓀴her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to
5126𓀴her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from
5127𓀴behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
5128𓀴although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he
5129𓀴had on neither collar nor necktie.
5130𓀴
5131𓀴“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
5132𓀴steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you
5133𓀴found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to
5134𓀴ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the
5135𓀴stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,
5136𓀴who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,
5137𓀴pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts
5138𓀴and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in
5139𓀴Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their
5140𓀴way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and
5141𓀴in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their
5142𓀴way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
5143𓀴sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one
5144𓀴to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,
5145𓀴made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one
5146𓀴else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was
5147𓀴their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to
5148𓀴believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she
5149𓀴sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid
5150𓀴from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy
5151𓀴which he had promised to bring home.
5152𓀴
5153𓀴“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
5154𓀴made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were
5155𓀴carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The
5156𓀴front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small
5157𓀴bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between
5158𓀴the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low
5159𓀴tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of
5160𓀴water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
5161𓀴examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and
5162𓀴several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the
5163𓀴bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the
5164𓀴clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His
5165𓀴boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no
5166𓀴signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other
5167𓀴traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently
5168𓀴have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous
5169𓀴bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save
5170𓀴himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment
5171𓀴of the tragedy.
5172𓀴
5173𓀴“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in
5174𓀴the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,
5175𓀴but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the
5176𓀴foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance
5177𓀴at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the
5178𓀴crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that
5179𓀴he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and
5180𓀴that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
5181𓀴gentleman’s clothes.
5182𓀴
5183𓀴“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives
5184𓀴upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last
5185𓀴human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh
5186𓀴Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who
5187𓀴goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to
5188𓀴avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax
5189𓀴vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the
5190𓀴left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in
5191𓀴the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
5192𓀴cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a
5193𓀴piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy
5194𓀴leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the
5195𓀴fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional
5196𓀴acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has
5197𓀴reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that
5198𓀴no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a
5199𓀴pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
5200𓀴turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair
5201𓀴of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the
5202𓀴colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of
5203𓀴mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply
5204𓀴to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
5205𓀴This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium
5206𓀴den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are
5207𓀴in quest.”
5208𓀴
5209𓀴“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against
5210𓀴a man in the prime of life?”
5211𓀴
5212𓀴“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other
5213𓀴respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your
5214𓀴medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is
5215𓀴often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”
5216𓀴
5217𓀴“Pray continue your narrative.”
5218𓀴
5219𓀴“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,
5220𓀴and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could
5221𓀴be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who
5222𓀴had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the
5223𓀴premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the
5224𓀴matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as
5225𓀴he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated
5226𓀴with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he
5227𓀴was seized and searched, without anything being found which could
5228𓀴incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his
5229𓀴right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
5230𓀴cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,
5231𓀴adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the
5232𓀴stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same
5233𓀴source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
5234𓀴and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a
5235𓀴mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that
5236𓀴she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she
5237𓀴must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly
5238𓀴protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon
5239𓀴the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
5240𓀴clue.
5241𓀴
5242𓀴“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
5243𓀴feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.
5244𓀴Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think
5245𓀴they found in the pockets?”
5246𓀴
5247𓀴“I cannot imagine.”
5248𓀴
5249𓀴“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies
5250𓀴and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder
5251𓀴that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a
5252𓀴different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the
5253𓀴house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when
5254𓀴the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”
5255𓀴
5256𓀴“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
5257𓀴Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”
5258𓀴
5259𓀴“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that
5260𓀴this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there
5261𓀴is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?
5262𓀴It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the
5263𓀴tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of
5264𓀴throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not
5265𓀴sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when
5266𓀴the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard
5267𓀴from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
5268𓀴There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,
5269𓀴where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
5270𓀴the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure
5271𓀴of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same
5272𓀴with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and
5273𓀴only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”
5274𓀴
5275𓀴“It certainly sounds feasible.”
5276𓀴
5277𓀴“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
5278𓀴Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but
5279𓀴it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against
5280𓀴him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life
5281𓀴appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter
5282𓀴stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what
5283𓀴Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when
5284𓀴there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his
5285𓀴disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I
5286𓀴cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
5287𓀴glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”
5288𓀴
5289𓀴While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
5290𓀴events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town
5291𓀴until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled
5292𓀴along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,
5293𓀴however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights
5294𓀴still glimmered in the windows.
5295𓀴
5296𓀴“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched
5297𓀴on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,
5298𓀴passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light
5299𓀴among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman
5300𓀴whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink
5301𓀴of our horse’s feet.”
5302𓀴
5303𓀴“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.
5304𓀴
5305𓀴“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.
5306𓀴Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest
5307𓀴assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and
5308𓀴colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her
5309𓀴husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”
5310𓀴
5311𓀴We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own
5312𓀴grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing
5313𓀴down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to
5314𓀴the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde
5315𓀴woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de
5316𓀴soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She
5317𓀴stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand
5318𓀴upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly
5319𓀴bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a
5320𓀴standing question.
5321𓀴
5322𓀴“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us,
5323𓀴she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my
5324𓀴companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
5325𓀴
5326𓀴“No good news?”
5327𓀴
5328𓀴“None.”
5329𓀴
5330𓀴“No bad?”
5331𓀴
5332𓀴“No.”
5333𓀴
5334𓀴“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a
5335𓀴long day.”
5336𓀴
5337𓀴“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in
5338𓀴several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to
5339𓀴bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”
5340𓀴
5341𓀴“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You
5342𓀴will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
5343𓀴arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly
5344𓀴upon us.”
5345𓀴
5346𓀴“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I
5347𓀴can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any
5348𓀴assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed
5349𓀴happy.”
5350𓀴
5351𓀴“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit
5352𓀴dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,
5353𓀴“I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
5354𓀴which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”
5355𓀴
5356𓀴“Certainly, madam.”
5357𓀴
5358𓀴“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to
5359𓀴fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”
5360𓀴
5361𓀴“Upon what point?”
5362𓀴
5363𓀴“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”
5364𓀴
5365𓀴Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,
5366𓀴now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at
5367𓀴him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
5368𓀴
5369𓀴“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”
5370𓀴
5371𓀴“You think that he is dead?”
5372𓀴
5373𓀴“I do.”
5374𓀴
5375𓀴“Murdered?”
5376𓀴
5377𓀴“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”
5378𓀴
5379𓀴“And on what day did he meet his death?”
5380𓀴
5381𓀴“On Monday.”
5382𓀴
5383𓀴“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is
5384𓀴that I have received a letter from him to-day.”
5385𓀴
5386𓀴Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
5387𓀴
5388𓀴“What!” he roared.
5389𓀴
5390𓀴“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in
5391𓀴the air.
5392𓀴
5393𓀴“May I see it?”
5394𓀴
5395𓀴“Certainly.”
5396𓀴
5397𓀴He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the
5398𓀴table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my
5399𓀴chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very
5400𓀴coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the
5401𓀴date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was
5402𓀴considerably after midnight.
5403𓀴
5404𓀴“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s
5405𓀴writing, madam.”
5406𓀴
5407𓀴“No, but the enclosure is.”
5408𓀴
5409𓀴“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and
5410𓀴inquire as to the address.”
5411𓀴
5412𓀴“How can you tell that?”
5413𓀴
5414𓀴“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
5415𓀴The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has
5416𓀴been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none
5417𓀴would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and
5418𓀴there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only
5419𓀴mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but
5420𓀴there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.
5421𓀴Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”
5422𓀴
5423𓀴“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”
5424𓀴
5425𓀴“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”
5426𓀴
5427𓀴“One of his hands.”
5428𓀴
5429𓀴“One?”
5430𓀴
5431𓀴“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,
5432𓀴and yet I know it well.”
5433𓀴
5434𓀴“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge
5435𓀴error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in
5436𓀴patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,
5437𓀴octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man
5438𓀴with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very
5439𓀴much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have
5440𓀴no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”
5441𓀴
5442𓀴“None. Neville wrote those words.”
5443𓀴
5444𓀴“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the
5445𓀴clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is
5446𓀴over.”
5447𓀴
5448𓀴“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”
5449𓀴
5450𓀴“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The
5451𓀴ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”
5452𓀴
5453𓀴“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”
5454𓀴
5455𓀴“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
5456𓀴posted to-day.”
5457𓀴
5458𓀴“That is possible.”
5459𓀴
5460𓀴“If so, much may have happened between.”
5461𓀴
5462𓀴“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well
5463𓀴with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if
5464𓀴evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself
5465𓀴in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly
5466𓀴with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think
5467𓀴that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his
5468𓀴death?”
5469𓀴
5470𓀴“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be
5471𓀴more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in
5472𓀴this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
5473𓀴corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write
5474𓀴letters, why should he remain away from you?”
5475𓀴
5476𓀴“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”
5477𓀴
5478𓀴“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”
5479𓀴
5480𓀴“No.”
5481𓀴
5482𓀴“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”
5483𓀴
5484𓀴“Very much so.”
5485𓀴
5486𓀴“Was the window open?”
5487𓀴
5488𓀴“Yes.”
5489𓀴
5490𓀴“Then he might have called to you?”
5491𓀴
5492𓀴“He might.”
5493𓀴
5494𓀴“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”
5495𓀴
5496𓀴“Yes.”
5497𓀴
5498𓀴“A call for help, you thought?”
5499𓀴
5500𓀴“Yes. He waved his hands.”
5501𓀴
5502𓀴“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
5503𓀴unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”
5504𓀴
5505𓀴“It is possible.”
5506𓀴
5507𓀴“And you thought he was pulled back?”
5508𓀴
5509𓀴“He disappeared so suddenly.”
5510𓀴
5511𓀴“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”
5512𓀴
5513𓀴“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the
5514𓀴Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”
5515𓀴
5516𓀴“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary
5517𓀴clothes on?”
5518𓀴
5519𓀴“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”
5520𓀴
5521𓀴“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”
5522𓀴
5523𓀴“Never.”
5524𓀴
5525𓀴“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”
5526𓀴
5527𓀴“Never.”
5528𓀴
5529𓀴“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which
5530𓀴I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and
5531𓀴then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”
5532𓀴
5533𓀴A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
5534𓀴disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after
5535𓀴my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he
5536𓀴had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for
5537𓀴a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking
5538𓀴at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or
5539𓀴convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident
5540𓀴to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off
5541𓀴his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then
5542𓀴wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions
5543𓀴from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
5544𓀴Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an
5545𓀴ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In
5546𓀴the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe
5547𓀴between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the
5548𓀴ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with
5549𓀴the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I
5550𓀴dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
5551𓀴to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The
5552𓀴pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the
5553𓀴room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap
5554𓀴of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
5555𓀴
5556𓀴“Awake, Watson?” he asked.
5557𓀴
5558𓀴“Yes.”
5559𓀴
5560𓀴“Game for a morning drive?”
5561𓀴
5562𓀴“Certainly.”
5563𓀴
5564𓀴“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy
5565𓀴sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as
5566𓀴he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
5567𓀴sombre thinker of the previous night.
5568𓀴
5569𓀴As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was
5570𓀴stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished
5571𓀴when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the
5572𓀴horse.
5573𓀴
5574𓀴“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his
5575𓀴boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of
5576𓀴one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from
5577𓀴here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”
5578𓀴
5579𓀴“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.
5580𓀴
5581𓀴“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he
5582𓀴continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and
5583𓀴I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,
5584𓀴my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”
5585𓀴
5586𓀴We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the
5587𓀴bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the
5588𓀴half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away
5589𓀴we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,
5590𓀴bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on
5591𓀴either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
5592𓀴
5593𓀴“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the
5594𓀴horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,
5595𓀴but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”
5596𓀴
5597𓀴In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from
5598𓀴their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.
5599𓀴Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and
5600𓀴dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found
5601𓀴ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,
5602𓀴and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the
5603𓀴horse’s head while the other led us in.
5604𓀴
5605𓀴“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.
5606𓀴
5607𓀴“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”
5608𓀴
5609𓀴“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the
5610𓀴stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to
5611𓀴have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”
5612𓀴
5613𓀴“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”
5614𓀴
5615𓀴It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
5616𓀴and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
5617𓀴desk.
5618𓀴
5619𓀴“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”
5620𓀴
5621𓀴“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with
5622𓀴being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”
5623𓀴
5624𓀴“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”
5625𓀴
5626𓀴“So I heard. You have him here?”
5627𓀴
5628𓀴“In the cells.”
5629𓀴
5630𓀴“Is he quiet?”
5631𓀴
5632𓀴“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”
5633𓀴
5634𓀴“Dirty?”
5635𓀴
5636𓀴“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is
5637𓀴as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he
5638𓀴will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would
5639𓀴agree with me that he needed it.”
5640𓀴
5641𓀴“I should like to see him very much.”
5642𓀴
5643𓀴“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your
5644𓀴bag.”
5645𓀴
5646𓀴“No, I think that I’ll take it.”
5647𓀴
5648𓀴“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,
5649𓀴opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a
5650𓀴whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
5651𓀴
5652𓀴“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He
5653𓀴quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced
5654𓀴through.
5655𓀴
5656𓀴“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”
5657𓀴
5658𓀴We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face
5659𓀴towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was
5660𓀴a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a
5661𓀴coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He
5662𓀴was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which
5663𓀴covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad
5664𓀴wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its
5665𓀴contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three
5666𓀴teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red
5667𓀴hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
5668𓀴
5669𓀴“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.
5670𓀴
5671𓀴“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he
5672𓀴might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened
5673𓀴the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very
5674𓀴large bath-sponge.
5675𓀴
5676𓀴“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.
5677𓀴
5678𓀴“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
5679𓀴quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”
5680𓀴
5681𓀴“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a
5682𓀴credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the
5683𓀴lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half
5684𓀴turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes
5685𓀴stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it
5686𓀴twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.
5687𓀴
5688𓀴“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,
5689𓀴in the county of Kent.”
5690𓀴
5691𓀴Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off
5692𓀴under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown
5693𓀴tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and
5694𓀴the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A
5695𓀴twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his
5696𓀴bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
5697𓀴smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy
5698𓀴bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a
5699𓀴scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
5700𓀴
5701𓀴“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.
5702𓀴I know him from the photograph.”
5703𓀴
5704𓀴The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
5705𓀴to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”
5706𓀴
5707𓀴“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged
5708𓀴with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the
5709𓀴inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the
5710𓀴force, but this really takes the cake.”
5711𓀴
5712𓀴“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has
5713𓀴been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”
5714𓀴
5715𓀴“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.
5716𓀴“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”
5717𓀴
5718𓀴“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God
5719𓀴help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an
5720𓀴exposure! What can I do?”
5721𓀴
5722𓀴Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly
5723𓀴on the shoulder.
5724𓀴
5725𓀴“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,
5726𓀴“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you
5727𓀴convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against
5728𓀴you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should
5729𓀴find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,
5730𓀴make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the
5731𓀴proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”
5732𓀴
5733𓀴“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured
5734𓀴imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable
5735𓀴secret as a family blot to my children.
5736𓀴
5737𓀴“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
5738𓀴schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.
5739𓀴I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a
5740𓀴reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to
5741𓀴have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I
5742𓀴volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my
5743𓀴adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I
5744𓀴could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I
5745𓀴had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been
5746𓀴famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my
5747𓀴attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as
5748𓀴possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by
5749𓀴the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head
5750𓀴of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
5751𓀴part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
5752𓀴For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the
5753𓀴evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.
5754𓀴4_d_.
5755𓀴
5756𓀴“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some
5757𓀴time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me
5758𓀴for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden
5759𓀴idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked
5760𓀴for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the
5761𓀴City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the
5762𓀴debt.
5763𓀴
5764𓀴“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work
5765𓀴at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by
5766𓀴smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
5767𓀴sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but
5768𓀴the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day
5769𓀴in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly
5770𓀴face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.
5771𓀴He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam
5772𓀴Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the
5773𓀴evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This
5774𓀴fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew
5775𓀴that my secret was safe in his possession.
5776𓀴
5777𓀴“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.
5778𓀴I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700
5779𓀴a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional
5780𓀴advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of
5781𓀴repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised
5782𓀴character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,
5783𓀴poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
5784𓀴£ 2.
5785𓀴
5786𓀴“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,
5787𓀴and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real
5788𓀴occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She
5789𓀴little knew what.
5790𓀴
5791𓀴“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room
5792𓀴above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my
5793𓀴horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with
5794𓀴her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms
5795𓀴to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated
5796𓀴him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice
5797𓀴downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off
5798𓀴my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and
5799𓀴wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But
5800𓀴then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and
5801𓀴that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by
5802𓀴my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the
5803𓀴bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the
5804𓀴coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in
5805𓀴which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it
5806𓀴disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but
5807𓀴at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few
5808𓀴minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of
5809𓀴being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his
5810𓀴murderer.
5811𓀴
5812𓀴“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was
5813𓀴determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my
5814𓀴preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly
5815𓀴anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a
5816𓀴moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried
5817𓀴scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”
5818𓀴
5819𓀴“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.
5820𓀴
5821𓀴“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”
5822𓀴
5823𓀴“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and
5824𓀴I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter
5825𓀴unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who
5826𓀴forgot all about it for some days.”
5827𓀴
5828𓀴“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of
5829𓀴it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”
5830𓀴
5831𓀴“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”
5832𓀴
5833𓀴“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to
5834𓀴hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”
5835𓀴
5836𓀴“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”
5837𓀴
5838𓀴“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be
5839𓀴taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,
5840𓀴Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
5841𓀴the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”
5842𓀴
5843𓀴“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and
5844𓀴consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker
5845𓀴Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”
5846𓀴
5847𓀴
5848𓀴
5849𓀴
5850𓀴VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
5851𓀴
5852𓀴
5853𓀴I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning
5854𓀴after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of
5855𓀴the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a
5856𓀴pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled
5857𓀴morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch
5858𓀴was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and
5859𓀴disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in
5860𓀴several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
5861𓀴suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
5862𓀴purpose of examination.
5863𓀴
5864𓀴“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”
5865𓀴
5866𓀴“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my
5867𓀴results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in
5868𓀴the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with
5869𓀴it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”
5870𓀴
5871𓀴I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
5872𓀴crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were
5873𓀴thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as
5874𓀴it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is
5875𓀴the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the
5876𓀴punishment of some crime.”
5877𓀴
5878𓀴“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those
5879𓀴whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million
5880𓀴human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square
5881𓀴miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,
5882𓀴every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and
5883𓀴many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and
5884𓀴bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of
5885𓀴such.”
5886𓀴
5887𓀴“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have
5888𓀴added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”
5889𓀴
5890𓀴“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,
5891𓀴to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of
5892𓀴the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small
5893𓀴matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,
5894𓀴the commissionaire?”
5895𓀴
5896𓀴“Yes.”
5897𓀴
5898𓀴“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”
5899𓀴
5900𓀴“It is his hat.”
5901𓀴
5902𓀴“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look
5903𓀴upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.
5904𓀴And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,
5905𓀴in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting
5906𓀴at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about
5907𓀴four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a
5908𓀴very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was
5909𓀴making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he
5910𓀴saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
5911𓀴carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
5912𓀴corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a
5913𓀴little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on
5914𓀴which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his
5915𓀴head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward
5916𓀴to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at
5917𓀴having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in
5918𓀴uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and
5919𓀴vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of
5920𓀴Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
5921𓀴Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and
5922𓀴also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a
5923𓀴most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”
5924𓀴
5925𓀴“Which surely he restored to their owner?”
5926𓀴
5927𓀴“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.
5928𓀴Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s
5929𓀴left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible
5930𓀴upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,
5931𓀴and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy
5932𓀴to restore lost property to any one of them.”
5933𓀴
5934𓀴“What, then, did Peterson do?”
5935𓀴
5936𓀴“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
5937𓀴knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The
5938𓀴goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in
5939𓀴spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten
5940𓀴without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to
5941𓀴fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the
5942𓀴hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”
5943𓀴
5944𓀴“Did he not advertise?”
5945𓀴
5946𓀴“No.”
5947𓀴
5948𓀴“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”
5949𓀴
5950𓀴“Only as much as we can deduce.”
5951𓀴
5952𓀴“From his hat?”
5953𓀴
5954𓀴“Precisely.”
5955𓀴
5956𓀴“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”
5957𓀴
5958𓀴“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as
5959𓀴to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”
5960𓀴
5961𓀴I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
5962𓀴ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,
5963𓀴hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but
5964𓀴was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes
5965𓀴had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was
5966𓀴pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For
5967𓀴the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several
5968𓀴places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
5969𓀴discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
5970𓀴
5971𓀴“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.
5972𓀴
5973𓀴“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to
5974𓀴reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your
5975𓀴inferences.”
5976𓀴
5977𓀴“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”
5978𓀴
5979𓀴He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
5980𓀴which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it
5981𓀴might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences
5982𓀴which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a
5983𓀴strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is
5984𓀴of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly
5985𓀴well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon
5986𓀴evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing
5987𓀴to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
5988𓀴fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at
5989𓀴work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife
5990𓀴has ceased to love him.”
5991𓀴
5992𓀴“My dear Holmes!”
5993𓀴
5994𓀴“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,
5995𓀴disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,
5996𓀴goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has
5997𓀴grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which
5998𓀴he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are
5999𓀴to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely
6000𓀴improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”
6001𓀴
6002𓀴“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”
6003𓀴
6004𓀴“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these
6005𓀴results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”
6006𓀴
6007𓀴“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am
6008𓀴unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was
6009𓀴intellectual?”
6010𓀴
6011𓀴For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the
6012𓀴forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of
6013𓀴cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have
6014𓀴something in it.”
6015𓀴
6016𓀴“The decline of his fortunes, then?”
6017𓀴
6018𓀴“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came
6019𓀴in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of
6020𓀴ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy
6021𓀴so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he
6022𓀴has assuredly gone down in the world.”
6023𓀴
6024𓀴“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and
6025𓀴the moral retrogression?”
6026𓀴
6027𓀴Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his
6028𓀴finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are
6029𓀴never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a
6030𓀴certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this
6031𓀴precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the
6032𓀴elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has
6033𓀴less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
6034𓀴weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some
6035𓀴of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign
6036𓀴that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”
6037𓀴
6038𓀴“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”
6039𓀴
6040𓀴“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,
6041𓀴that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to
6042𓀴be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.
6043𓀴The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the
6044𓀴scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a
6045𓀴distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the
6046𓀴gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
6047𓀴showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the
6048𓀴marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer
6049𓀴perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of
6050𓀴training.”
6051𓀴
6052𓀴“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”
6053𓀴
6054𓀴“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
6055𓀴Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your
6056𓀴wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also
6057𓀴have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”
6058𓀴
6059𓀴“But he might be a bachelor.”
6060𓀴
6061𓀴“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.
6062𓀴Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”
6063𓀴
6064𓀴“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that
6065𓀴the gas is not laid on in his house?”
6066𓀴
6067𓀴“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no
6068𓀴less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the
6069𓀴individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
6070𓀴tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a
6071𓀴guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from
6072𓀴a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”
6073𓀴
6074𓀴“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said
6075𓀴just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the
6076𓀴loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”
6077𓀴
6078𓀴Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,
6079𓀴and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with
6080𓀴flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
6081𓀴
6082𓀴“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.
6083𓀴
6084𓀴“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through
6085𓀴the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get
6086𓀴a fairer view of the man’s excited face.
6087𓀴
6088𓀴“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his
6089𓀴hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
6090𓀴scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of
6091𓀴such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the
6092𓀴dark hollow of his hand.
6093𓀴
6094𓀴Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he,
6095𓀴“this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”
6096𓀴
6097𓀴“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were
6098𓀴putty.”
6099𓀴
6100𓀴“It’s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.”
6101𓀴
6102𓀴“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.
6103𓀴
6104𓀴“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have
6105𓀴read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It is
6106𓀴absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the
6107𓀴reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of
6108𓀴the market price.”
6109𓀴
6110𓀴“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped
6111𓀴down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
6112𓀴
6113𓀴“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
6114𓀴sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the
6115𓀴Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the
6116𓀴gem.”
6117𓀴
6118𓀴“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I
6119𓀴remarked.
6120𓀴
6121𓀴“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a
6122𓀴plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s
6123𓀴jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has
6124𓀴been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I
6125𓀴believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,
6126𓀴until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the
6127𓀴following paragraph:
6128𓀴
6129𓀴“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
6130𓀴brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted
6131𓀴from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as
6132𓀴the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his
6133𓀴evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room
6134𓀴of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he
6135𓀴might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
6136𓀴remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called
6137𓀴away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the
6138𓀴bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in
6139𓀴which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep
6140𓀴her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly
6141𓀴gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone
6142𓀴could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine
6143𓀴Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of
6144𓀴dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
6145𓀴where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector
6146𓀴Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who
6147𓀴struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest
6148𓀴terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given
6149𓀴against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the
6150𓀴offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of
6151𓀴intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion
6152𓀴and was carried out of court.”
6153𓀴
6154𓀴“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing
6155𓀴aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of
6156𓀴events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a
6157𓀴goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little
6158𓀴deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less
6159𓀴innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and
6160𓀴the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and
6161𓀴all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we
6162𓀴must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
6163𓀴ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do
6164𓀴this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly
6165𓀴in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall
6166𓀴have recourse to other methods.”
6167𓀴
6168𓀴“What will you say?”
6169𓀴
6170𓀴“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the
6171𓀴corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker
6172𓀴can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker
6173𓀴Street.’ That is clear and concise.”
6174𓀴
6175𓀴“Very. But will he see it?”
6176𓀴
6177𓀴“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,
6178𓀴the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in
6179𓀴breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of
6180𓀴nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the
6181𓀴impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the
6182𓀴introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who
6183𓀴knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run
6184𓀴down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening
6185𓀴papers.”
6186𓀴
6187𓀴“In which, sir?”
6188𓀴
6189𓀴“Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James’s Gazette_,
6190𓀴_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.”
6191𓀴
6192𓀴“Very well, sir. And this stone?”
6193𓀴
6194𓀴“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just
6195𓀴buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must
6196𓀴have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your
6197𓀴family is now devouring.”
6198𓀴
6199𓀴When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it
6200𓀴against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it
6201𓀴glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
6202𓀴Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and
6203𓀴older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not
6204𓀴yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in
6205𓀴southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
6206𓀴carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite
6207𓀴of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two
6208𓀴murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought
6209𓀴about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
6210𓀴Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows
6211𓀴and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to
6212𓀴the Countess to say that we have it.”
6213𓀴
6214𓀴“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”
6215𓀴
6216𓀴“I cannot tell.”
6217𓀴
6218𓀴“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
6219𓀴anything to do with the matter?”
6220𓀴
6221𓀴“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely
6222𓀴innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was
6223𓀴of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,
6224𓀴however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer
6225𓀴to our advertisement.”
6226𓀴
6227𓀴“And you can do nothing until then?”
6228𓀴
6229𓀴“Nothing.”
6230𓀴
6231𓀴“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come
6232𓀴back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like
6233𓀴to see the solution of so tangled a business.”
6234𓀴
6235𓀴“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.
6236𓀴By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.
6237𓀴Hudson to examine its crop.”
6238𓀴
6239𓀴I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six
6240𓀴when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the
6241𓀴house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was
6242𓀴buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which
6243𓀴was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,
6244𓀴and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.
6245𓀴
6246𓀴“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and
6247𓀴greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so
6248𓀴readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a
6249𓀴cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for
6250𓀴summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right
6251𓀴time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”
6252𓀴
6253𓀴“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”
6254𓀴
6255𓀴He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,
6256𓀴intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A
6257𓀴touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended
6258𓀴hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black
6259𓀴frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,
6260𓀴and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff
6261𓀴or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with
6262𓀴care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
6263𓀴letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
6264𓀴
6265𓀴“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we
6266𓀴expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at
6267𓀴a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”
6268𓀴
6269𓀴Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so
6270𓀴plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that
6271𓀴the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the
6272𓀴bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at
6273𓀴recovering them.”
6274𓀴
6275𓀴“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat
6276𓀴it.”
6277𓀴
6278𓀴“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
6279𓀴
6280𓀴“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I
6281𓀴presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the
6282𓀴same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally
6283𓀴well?”
6284𓀴
6285𓀴“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.
6286𓀴
6287𓀴“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your
6288𓀴own bird, so if you wish—”
6289𓀴
6290𓀴The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as
6291𓀴relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see
6292𓀴what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be
6293𓀴to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my
6294𓀴attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”
6295𓀴
6296𓀴Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his
6297𓀴shoulders.
6298𓀴
6299𓀴“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way,
6300𓀴would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am
6301𓀴somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown
6302𓀴goose.”
6303𓀴
6304𓀴“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained
6305𓀴property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha
6306𓀴Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the
6307𓀴day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,
6308𓀴instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence
6309𓀴every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were
6310𓀴duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,
6311𓀴sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”
6312𓀴With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
6313𓀴strode off upon his way.
6314𓀴
6315𓀴“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door
6316𓀴behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about
6317𓀴the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”
6318𓀴
6319𓀴“Not particularly.”
6320𓀴
6321𓀴“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up
6322𓀴this clue while it is still hot.”
6323𓀴
6324𓀴“By all means.”
6325𓀴
6326𓀴It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats
6327𓀴about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a
6328𓀴cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
6329𓀴like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as
6330𓀴we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,
6331𓀴and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an
6332𓀴hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small
6333𓀴public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into
6334𓀴Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two
6335𓀴glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
6336𓀴
6337𓀴“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said
6338𓀴he.
6339𓀴
6340𓀴“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.
6341𓀴
6342𓀴“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was
6343𓀴a member of your goose club.”
6344𓀴
6345𓀴“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”
6346𓀴
6347𓀴“Indeed! Whose, then?”
6348𓀴
6349𓀴“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”
6350𓀴
6351𓀴“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”
6352𓀴
6353𓀴“Breckinridge is his name.”
6354𓀴
6355𓀴“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and
6356𓀴prosperity to your house. Good-night.”
6357𓀴
6358𓀴“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we
6359𓀴came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so
6360𓀴homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the
6361𓀴other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless
6362𓀴we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but
6363𓀴confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation
6364𓀴which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has
6365𓀴placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to
6366𓀴the south, then, and quick march!”
6367𓀴
6368𓀴We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag
6369𓀴of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the
6370𓀴name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,
6371𓀴with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up
6372𓀴the shutters.
6373𓀴
6374𓀴“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.
6375𓀴
6376𓀴The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
6377𓀴
6378𓀴“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare
6379𓀴slabs of marble.
6380𓀴
6381𓀴“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”
6382𓀴
6383𓀴“That’s no good.”
6384𓀴
6385𓀴“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”
6386𓀴
6387𓀴“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”
6388𓀴
6389𓀴“Who by?”
6390𓀴
6391𓀴“The landlord of the Alpha.”
6392𓀴
6393𓀴“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”
6394𓀴
6395𓀴“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”
6396𓀴
6397𓀴To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
6398𓀴salesman.
6399𓀴
6400𓀴“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,
6401𓀴“what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”
6402𓀴
6403𓀴“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese
6404𓀴which you supplied to the Alpha.”
6405𓀴
6406𓀴“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”
6407𓀴
6408𓀴“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should
6409𓀴be so warm over such a trifle.”
6410𓀴
6411𓀴“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I
6412𓀴pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the
6413𓀴business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the
6414𓀴geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they
6415𓀴were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over
6416𓀴them.”
6417𓀴
6418𓀴“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making
6419𓀴inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is
6420𓀴off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter
6421𓀴of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country
6422𓀴bred.”
6423𓀴
6424𓀴“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the
6425𓀴salesman.
6426𓀴
6427𓀴“It’s nothing of the kind.”
6428𓀴
6429𓀴“I say it is.”
6430𓀴
6431𓀴“I don’t believe it.”
6432𓀴
6433𓀴“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them
6434𓀴ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the
6435𓀴Alpha were town bred.”
6436𓀴
6437𓀴“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”
6438𓀴
6439𓀴“Will you bet, then?”
6440𓀴
6441𓀴“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll
6442𓀴have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”
6443𓀴
6444𓀴The salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.
6445𓀴
6446𓀴The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
6447𓀴greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
6448𓀴
6449𓀴“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out
6450𓀴of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left
6451𓀴in my shop. You see this little book?”
6452𓀴
6453𓀴“Well?”
6454𓀴
6455𓀴“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,
6456𓀴here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their
6457𓀴names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You
6458𓀴see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town
6459𓀴suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”
6460𓀴
6461𓀴“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.
6462𓀴
6463𓀴“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”
6464𓀴
6465𓀴Holmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,
6466𓀴117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”
6467𓀴
6468𓀴“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”
6469𓀴
6470𓀴“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.’”
6471𓀴
6472𓀴“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”
6473𓀴
6474𓀴“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.’”
6475𓀴
6476𓀴“What have you to say now?”
6477𓀴
6478𓀴Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his
6479𓀴pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a
6480𓀴man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped
6481𓀴under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which
6482𓀴was peculiar to him.
6483𓀴
6484𓀴“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’
6485𓀴protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said
6486𓀴he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man
6487𓀴would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him
6488𓀴by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I
6489𓀴fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains
6490𓀴to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott
6491𓀴to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear
6492𓀴from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides
6493𓀴ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”
6494𓀴
6495𓀴His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out
6496𓀴from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little
6497𓀴rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
6498𓀴which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the
6499𓀴salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists
6500𓀴fiercely at the cringing figure.
6501𓀴
6502𓀴“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were
6503𓀴all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your
6504𓀴silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and
6505𓀴I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese
6506𓀴off you?”
6507𓀴
6508𓀴“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.
6509𓀴
6510𓀴“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”
6511𓀴
6512𓀴“She told me to ask you.”
6513𓀴
6514𓀴“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough
6515𓀴of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer
6516𓀴flitted away into the darkness.
6517𓀴
6518𓀴“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come
6519𓀴with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding
6520𓀴through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring
6521𓀴stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him
6522𓀴upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light
6523𓀴that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
6524𓀴
6525𓀴“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.
6526𓀴
6527𓀴“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help
6528𓀴overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I
6529𓀴think that I could be of assistance to you.”
6530𓀴
6531𓀴“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”
6532𓀴
6533𓀴“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
6534𓀴people don’t know.”
6535𓀴
6536𓀴“But you can know nothing of this?”
6537𓀴
6538𓀴“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some
6539𓀴geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman
6540𓀴named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and
6541𓀴by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”
6542𓀴
6543𓀴“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the
6544𓀴little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can
6545𓀴hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”
6546𓀴
6547𓀴Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case
6548𓀴we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept
6549𓀴market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it
6550𓀴is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”
6551𓀴
6552𓀴The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he
6553𓀴answered with a sidelong glance.
6554𓀴
6555𓀴“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward
6556𓀴doing business with an alias.”
6557𓀴
6558𓀴A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said
6559𓀴he, “my real name is James Ryder.”
6560𓀴
6561𓀴“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into
6562𓀴the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you
6563𓀴would wish to know.”
6564𓀴
6565𓀴The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
6566𓀴half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he
6567𓀴is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into
6568𓀴the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker
6569𓀴Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin
6570𓀴breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of
6571𓀴his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
6572𓀴
6573𓀴“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. “The
6574𓀴fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.
6575𓀴Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we
6576𓀴settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what
6577𓀴became of those geese?”
6578𓀴
6579𓀴“Yes, sir.”
6580𓀴
6581𓀴“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which
6582𓀴you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”
6583𓀴
6584𓀴Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me
6585𓀴where it went to?”
6586𓀴
6587𓀴“It came here.”
6588𓀴
6589𓀴“Here?”
6590𓀴
6591𓀴“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you
6592𓀴should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the
6593𓀴bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here
6594𓀴in my museum.”
6595𓀴
6596𓀴Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his
6597𓀴right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue
6598𓀴carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,
6599𓀴many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain
6600𓀴whether to claim or to disown it.
6601𓀴
6602𓀴“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll
6603𓀴be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not
6604𓀴got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of
6605𓀴brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to
6606𓀴be sure!”
6607𓀴
6608𓀴For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought
6609𓀴a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened
6610𓀴eyes at his accuser.
6611𓀴
6612𓀴“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could
6613𓀴possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that
6614𓀴little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had
6615𓀴heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”
6616𓀴
6617𓀴“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling
6618𓀴voice.
6619𓀴
6620𓀴“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden
6621𓀴wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for
6622𓀴better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means
6623𓀴you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very
6624𓀴pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had
6625𓀴been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would
6626𓀴rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some
6627𓀴small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you
6628𓀴managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you
6629𓀴rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
6630𓀴arrested. You then—”
6631𓀴
6632𓀴Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
6633𓀴companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of
6634𓀴my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went
6635𓀴wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.
6636𓀴Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”
6637𓀴
6638𓀴“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to
6639𓀴cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner
6640𓀴in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”
6641𓀴
6642𓀴“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge
6643𓀴against him will break down.”
6644𓀴
6645𓀴“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of
6646𓀴the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose
6647𓀴into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope
6648𓀴of safety.”
6649𓀴
6650𓀴Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just
6651𓀴as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it
6652𓀴seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at
6653𓀴once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it
6654𓀴into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the
6655𓀴hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and
6656𓀴I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and
6657𓀴lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the
6658𓀴way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
6659𓀴detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring
6660𓀴down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what
6661𓀴was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been
6662𓀴upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard
6663𓀴and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
6664𓀴
6665𓀴“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just
6666𓀴been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell
6667𓀴into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what
6668𓀴they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two
6669𓀴things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where
6670𓀴he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn
6671𓀴the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the
6672𓀴agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any
6673𓀴moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my
6674𓀴waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and
6675𓀴looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and
6676𓀴suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
6677𓀴best detective that ever lived.
6678𓀴
6679𓀴“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of
6680𓀴her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as
6681𓀴good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my
6682𓀴stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this
6683𓀴I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I
6684𓀴caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat
6685𓀴as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the
6686𓀴stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature
6687𓀴flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
6688𓀴matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered
6689𓀴off among the others.
6690𓀴
6691𓀴“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.
6692𓀴
6693𓀴“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was
6694𓀴feeling which was the fattest.’
6695𓀴
6696𓀴“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it.
6697𓀴It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which
6698𓀴makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’
6699𓀴
6700𓀴“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d
6701𓀴rather have that one I was handling just now.’
6702𓀴
6703𓀴“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened
6704𓀴it expressly for you.’
6705𓀴
6706𓀴“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.
6707𓀴
6708𓀴“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you
6709𓀴want, then?’
6710𓀴
6711𓀴“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
6712𓀴flock.’
6713𓀴
6714𓀴“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’
6715𓀴
6716𓀴“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the
6717𓀴way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it
6718𓀴was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and
6719𓀴we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for
6720𓀴there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake
6721𓀴had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried
6722𓀴into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
6723𓀴
6724𓀴“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.
6725𓀴
6726𓀴“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’
6727𓀴
6728𓀴“‘Which dealer’s?’
6729𓀴
6730𓀴“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’
6731𓀴
6732𓀴“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the
6733𓀴one I chose?’
6734𓀴
6735𓀴“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell
6736𓀴them apart.’
6737𓀴
6738𓀴“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet
6739𓀴would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at
6740𓀴once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You
6741𓀴heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like
6742𓀴that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am
6743𓀴myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever
6744𓀴having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!
6745𓀴God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in
6746𓀴his hands.
6747𓀴
6748𓀴There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the
6749𓀴measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger-tips upon the edge of the
6750𓀴table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
6751𓀴
6752𓀴“Get out!” said he.
6753𓀴
6754𓀴“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”
6755𓀴
6756𓀴“No more words. Get out!”
6757𓀴
6758𓀴And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the
6759𓀴stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls
6760𓀴from the street.
6761𓀴
6762𓀴“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay
6763𓀴pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If
6764𓀴Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will
6765𓀴not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am
6766𓀴commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
6767𓀴This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
6768𓀴Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,
6769𓀴it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most
6770𓀴singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If
6771𓀴you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
6772𓀴another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
6773𓀴feature.”
6774𓀴
6775𓀴
6776𓀴
6777𓀴
6778𓀴VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
6779𓀴
6780𓀴
6781𓀴On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have
6782𓀴during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock
6783𓀴Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,
6784𓀴but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his
6785𓀴art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself
6786𓀴with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even
6787𓀴the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any
6788𓀴which presented more singular features than that which was associated
6789𓀴with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The
6790𓀴events in question occurred in the early days of my association with
6791𓀴Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is
6792𓀴possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a
6793𓀴promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been
6794𓀴freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom
6795𓀴the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now
6796𓀴come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread
6797𓀴rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the
6798𓀴matter even more terrible than the truth.
6799𓀴
6800𓀴It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find
6801𓀴Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was
6802𓀴a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me
6803𓀴that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some
6804𓀴surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself
6805𓀴regular in my habits.
6806𓀴
6807𓀴“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot
6808𓀴this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,
6809𓀴and I on you.”
6810𓀴
6811𓀴“What is it, then—a fire?”
6812𓀴
6813𓀴“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable
6814𓀴state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in
6815𓀴the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at
6816𓀴this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,
6817𓀴I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to
6818𓀴communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am
6819𓀴sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I
6820𓀴should call you and give you the chance.”
6821𓀴
6822𓀴“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”
6823𓀴
6824𓀴I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional
6825𓀴investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as
6826𓀴intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he
6827𓀴unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on
6828𓀴my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down
6829𓀴to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who
6830𓀴had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
6831𓀴
6832𓀴“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock
6833𓀴Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before
6834𓀴whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see
6835𓀴that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up
6836𓀴to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that
6837𓀴you are shivering.”
6838𓀴
6839𓀴“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice,
6840𓀴changing her seat as requested.
6841𓀴
6842𓀴“What, then?”
6843𓀴
6844𓀴“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she
6845𓀴spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
6846𓀴agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,
6847𓀴like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of
6848𓀴a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her
6849𓀴expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one
6850𓀴of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
6851𓀴
6852𓀴“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting
6853𓀴her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You
6854𓀴have come in by train this morning, I see.”
6855𓀴
6856𓀴“You know me, then?”
6857𓀴
6858𓀴“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of
6859𓀴your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good
6860𓀴drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
6861𓀴station.”
6862𓀴
6863𓀴The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
6864𓀴companion.
6865𓀴
6866𓀴“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm
6867𓀴of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The
6868𓀴marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which
6869𓀴throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand
6870𓀴side of the driver.”
6871𓀴
6872𓀴“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I
6873𓀴started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and
6874𓀴came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no
6875𓀴longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,
6876𓀴save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little
6877𓀴aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.
6878𓀴Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from
6879𓀴her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could
6880𓀴help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense
6881𓀴darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
6882𓀴you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,
6883𓀴with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find
6884𓀴me ungrateful.”
6885𓀴
6886𓀴Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
6887𓀴case-book, which he consulted.
6888𓀴
6889𓀴“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with
6890𓀴an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,
6891𓀴madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I
6892𓀴did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own
6893𓀴reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put
6894𓀴to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay
6895𓀴before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
6896𓀴matter.”
6897𓀴
6898𓀴“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in
6899𓀴the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so
6900𓀴entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that
6901𓀴even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and
6902𓀴advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a
6903𓀴nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing
6904𓀴answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can
6905𓀴see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may
6906𓀴advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”
6907𓀴
6908𓀴“I am all attention, madam.”
6909𓀴
6910𓀴“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is
6911𓀴the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the
6912𓀴Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”
6913𓀴
6914𓀴Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.
6915𓀴
6916𓀴“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
6917𓀴estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and
6918𓀴Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive
6919𓀴heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin
6920𓀴was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.
6921𓀴Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the
6922𓀴two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy
6923𓀴mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the
6924𓀴horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my
6925𓀴stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
6926𓀴obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a
6927𓀴medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional
6928𓀴skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a
6929𓀴fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been
6930𓀴perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and
6931𓀴narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term
6932𓀴of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and
6933𓀴disappointed man.
6934𓀴
6935𓀴“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the
6936𓀴young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister
6937𓀴Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of
6938𓀴my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less
6939𓀴than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely
6940𓀴while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum
6941𓀴should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly
6942𓀴after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years
6943𓀴ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
6944𓀴attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live
6945𓀴with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my
6946𓀴mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no
6947𓀴obstacle to our happiness.
6948𓀴
6949𓀴“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
6950𓀴Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,
6951𓀴who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in
6952𓀴the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came
6953𓀴out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his
6954𓀴path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in
6955𓀴the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe,
6956𓀴been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
6957𓀴disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,
6958𓀴until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would
6959𓀴fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and
6960𓀴absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
6961𓀴
6962𓀴“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,
6963𓀴and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather
6964𓀴together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no
6965𓀴friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these
6966𓀴vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land
6967𓀴which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the
6968𓀴hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for
6969𓀴weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent
6970𓀴over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and
6971𓀴a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
6972𓀴villagers almost as much as their master.
6973𓀴
6974𓀴“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no
6975𓀴great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a
6976𓀴long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the
6977𓀴time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even
6978𓀴as mine has.”
6979𓀴
6980𓀴“Your sister is dead, then?”
6981𓀴
6982𓀴“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to
6983𓀴speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have
6984𓀴described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and
6985𓀴position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss
6986𓀴Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally
6987𓀴allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at
6988𓀴Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to
6989𓀴whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when
6990𓀴my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within
6991𓀴a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the
6992𓀴terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”
6993𓀴
6994𓀴Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed
6995𓀴and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and
6996𓀴glanced across at his visitor.
6997𓀴
6998𓀴“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.
6999𓀴
7000𓀴“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is
7001𓀴seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very
7002𓀴old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are
7003𓀴on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of
7004𓀴the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second
7005𓀴my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between
7006𓀴them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself
7007𓀴plain?”
7008𓀴
7009𓀴“Perfectly so.”
7010𓀴
7011𓀴“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal
7012𓀴night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he
7013𓀴had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the
7014𓀴strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her
7015𓀴room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,
7016𓀴chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to
7017𓀴leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
7018𓀴
7019𓀴“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the
7020𓀴dead of the night?’
7021𓀴
7022𓀴“‘Never,’ said I.
7023𓀴
7024𓀴“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your
7025𓀴sleep?’
7026𓀴
7027𓀴“‘Certainly not. But why?’
7028𓀴
7029𓀴“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the
7030𓀴morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has
7031𓀴awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next
7032𓀴room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you
7033𓀴whether you had heard it.’
7034𓀴
7035𓀴“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’
7036𓀴
7037𓀴“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did
7038𓀴not hear it also.’
7039𓀴
7040𓀴“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’
7041𓀴
7042𓀴“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at
7043𓀴me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the
7044𓀴lock.”
7045𓀴
7046𓀴“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in
7047𓀴at night?”
7048𓀴
7049𓀴“Always.”
7050𓀴
7051𓀴“And why?”
7052𓀴
7053𓀴“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a
7054𓀴baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”
7055𓀴
7056𓀴“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”
7057𓀴
7058𓀴“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune
7059𓀴impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you
7060𓀴know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely
7061𓀴allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain
7062𓀴was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the
7063𓀴hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified
7064𓀴woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,
7065𓀴wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my
7066𓀴door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a
7067𓀴few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.
7068𓀴As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved
7069𓀴slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing
7070𓀴what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I
7071𓀴saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her
7072𓀴hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that
7073𓀴of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
7074𓀴moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She
7075𓀴writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully
7076𓀴convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I
7077𓀴bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never
7078𓀴forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There
7079𓀴was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with
7080𓀴her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a
7081𓀴fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling
7082𓀴loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
7083𓀴dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,
7084𓀴and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid
7085𓀴from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and
7086𓀴died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful
7087𓀴end of my beloved sister.”
7088𓀴
7089𓀴“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and
7090𓀴metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”
7091𓀴
7092𓀴“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my
7093𓀴strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale
7094𓀴and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”
7095𓀴
7096𓀴“Was your sister dressed?”
7097𓀴
7098𓀴“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
7099𓀴charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”
7100𓀴
7101𓀴“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the
7102𓀴alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the
7103𓀴coroner come to?”
7104𓀴
7105𓀴“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct
7106𓀴had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any
7107𓀴satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been
7108𓀴fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by
7109𓀴old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every
7110𓀴night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite
7111𓀴solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with
7112𓀴the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large
7113𓀴staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when
7114𓀴she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon
7115𓀴her.”
7116𓀴
7117𓀴“How about poison?”
7118𓀴
7119𓀴“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”
7120𓀴
7121𓀴“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”
7122𓀴
7123𓀴“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though
7124𓀴what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”
7125𓀴
7126𓀴“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”
7127𓀴
7128𓀴“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”
7129𓀴
7130𓀴“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled
7131𓀴band?”
7132𓀴
7133𓀴“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,
7134𓀴sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to
7135𓀴these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted
7136𓀴handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have
7137𓀴suggested the strange adjective which she used.”
7138𓀴
7139𓀴Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
7140𓀴
7141𓀴“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your
7142𓀴narrative.”
7143𓀴
7144𓀴“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately
7145𓀴lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have
7146𓀴known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in
7147𓀴marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr.
7148𓀴Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no
7149𓀴opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the
7150𓀴spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the
7151𓀴building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to
7152𓀴move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very
7153𓀴bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
7154𓀴night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly
7155𓀴heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the
7156𓀴herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was
7157𓀴to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,
7158𓀴so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a
7159𓀴dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,
7160𓀴from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing
7161𓀴you and asking your advice.”
7162𓀴
7163𓀴“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”
7164𓀴
7165𓀴“Yes, all.”
7166𓀴
7167𓀴“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”
7168𓀴
7169𓀴“Why, what do you mean?”
7170𓀴
7171𓀴For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the
7172𓀴hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the
7173𓀴marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
7174𓀴
7175𓀴“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.
7176𓀴
7177𓀴The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a
7178𓀴hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”
7179𓀴
7180𓀴There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his
7181𓀴hands and stared into the crackling fire.
7182𓀴
7183𓀴“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand
7184𓀴details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course
7185𓀴of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to
7186𓀴Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms
7187𓀴without the knowledge of your stepfather?”
7188𓀴
7189𓀴“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most
7190𓀴important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and
7191𓀴that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,
7192𓀴but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”
7193𓀴
7194𓀴“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”
7195𓀴
7196𓀴“By no means.”
7197𓀴
7198𓀴“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”
7199𓀴
7200𓀴“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in
7201𓀴town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there
7202𓀴in time for your coming.”
7203𓀴
7204𓀴“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small
7205𓀴business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”
7206𓀴
7207𓀴“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my
7208𓀴trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this
7209𓀴afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
7210𓀴from the room.
7211𓀴
7212𓀴“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,
7213𓀴leaning back in his chair.
7214𓀴
7215𓀴“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”
7216𓀴
7217𓀴“Dark enough and sinister enough.”
7218𓀴
7219𓀴“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are
7220𓀴sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her
7221𓀴sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
7222𓀴end.”
7223𓀴
7224𓀴“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very
7225𓀴peculiar words of the dying woman?”
7226𓀴
7227𓀴“I cannot think.”
7228𓀴
7229𓀴“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a
7230𓀴band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the
7231𓀴fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an
7232𓀴interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion
7233𓀴to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a
7234𓀴metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars
7235𓀴that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that
7236𓀴there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along
7237𓀴those lines.”
7238𓀴
7239𓀴“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”
7240𓀴
7241𓀴“I cannot imagine.”
7242𓀴
7243𓀴“I see many objections to any such theory.”
7244𓀴
7245𓀴“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to
7246𓀴Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,
7247𓀴or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”
7248𓀴
7249𓀴The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our
7250𓀴door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed
7251𓀴himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the
7252𓀴professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long
7253𓀴frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in
7254𓀴his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of
7255𓀴the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to
7256𓀴side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with
7257𓀴the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the
7258𓀴other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
7259𓀴fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird
7260𓀴of prey.
7261𓀴
7262𓀴“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.
7263𓀴
7264𓀴“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion
7265𓀴quietly.
7266𓀴
7267𓀴“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”
7268𓀴
7269𓀴“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”
7270𓀴
7271𓀴“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have
7272𓀴traced her. What has she been saying to you?”
7273𓀴
7274𓀴“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.
7275𓀴
7276𓀴“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.
7277𓀴
7278𓀴“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my
7279𓀴companion imperturbably.
7280𓀴
7281𓀴“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step
7282𓀴forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I
7283𓀴have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”
7284𓀴
7285𓀴My friend smiled.
7286𓀴
7287𓀴“Holmes, the busybody!”
7288𓀴
7289𓀴His smile broadened.
7290𓀴
7291𓀴“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”
7292𓀴
7293𓀴Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”
7294𓀴said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided
7295𓀴draught.”
7296𓀴
7297𓀴“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my
7298𓀴affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a
7299𓀴dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,
7300𓀴seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
7301𓀴
7302𓀴“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling
7303𓀴the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
7304𓀴
7305𓀴“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not
7306𓀴quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my
7307𓀴grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up
7308𓀴the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
7309𓀴
7310𓀴“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
7311𓀴detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
7312𓀴however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from
7313𓀴her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we
7314𓀴shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’
7315𓀴Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this
7316𓀴matter.”
7317𓀴
7318𓀴It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
7319𓀴excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
7320𓀴with notes and figures.
7321𓀴
7322𓀴“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its
7323𓀴exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the
7324𓀴investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the
7325𓀴time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through
7326𓀴the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can
7327𓀴claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,
7328𓀴therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a
7329𓀴mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very
7330𓀴serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has
7331𓀴proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way
7332𓀴of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for
7333𓀴dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting
7334𓀴ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and
7335𓀴drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your
7336𓀴revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument
7337𓀴with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a
7338𓀴tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”
7339𓀴
7340𓀴At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,
7341𓀴where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five
7342𓀴miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a
7343𓀴bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and
7344𓀴wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the
7345𓀴air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least
7346𓀴there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring
7347𓀴and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
7348𓀴the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his
7349𓀴eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.
7350𓀴Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed
7351𓀴over the meadows.
7352𓀴
7353𓀴“Look there!” said he.
7354𓀴
7355𓀴A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into
7356𓀴a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out
7357𓀴the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
7358𓀴
7359𓀴“Stoke Moran?” said he.
7360𓀴
7361𓀴“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the
7362𓀴driver.
7363𓀴
7364𓀴“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we
7365𓀴are going.”
7366𓀴
7367𓀴“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs
7368𓀴some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll
7369𓀴find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the
7370𓀴fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”
7371𓀴
7372𓀴“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his
7373𓀴eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”
7374𓀴
7375𓀴We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to
7376𓀴Leatherhead.
7377𓀴
7378𓀴“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this
7379𓀴fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite
7380𓀴business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see
7381𓀴that we have been as good as our word.”
7382𓀴
7383𓀴Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
7384𓀴which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she
7385𓀴cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.
7386𓀴Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back
7387𓀴before evening.”
7388𓀴
7389𓀴“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said
7390𓀴Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss
7391𓀴Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
7392𓀴
7393𓀴“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”
7394𓀴
7395𓀴“So it appears.”
7396𓀴
7397𓀴“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will
7398𓀴he say when he returns?”
7399𓀴
7400𓀴“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more
7401𓀴cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him
7402𓀴to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at
7403𓀴Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us
7404𓀴at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”
7405𓀴
7406𓀴The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central
7407𓀴portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on
7408𓀴each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked
7409𓀴with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of
7410𓀴ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the
7411𓀴right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the
7412𓀴windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that
7413𓀴this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected
7414𓀴against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but
7415𓀴there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes
7416𓀴walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep
7417𓀴attention the outsides of the windows.
7418𓀴
7419𓀴“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the
7420𓀴centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to
7421𓀴Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”
7422𓀴
7423𓀴“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”
7424𓀴
7425𓀴“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not
7426𓀴seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”
7427𓀴
7428𓀴“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my
7429𓀴room.”
7430𓀴
7431𓀴“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing
7432𓀴runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows
7433𓀴in it, of course?”
7434𓀴
7435𓀴“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”
7436𓀴
7437𓀴“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable
7438𓀴from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room
7439𓀴and bar your shutters?”
7440𓀴
7441𓀴Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the
7442𓀴open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but
7443𓀴without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be
7444𓀴passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but
7445𓀴they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”
7446𓀴said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly
7447𓀴presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they
7448𓀴were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the
7449𓀴matter.”
7450𓀴
7451𓀴A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the
7452𓀴three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so
7453𓀴we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now
7454𓀴sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a
7455𓀴homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after
7456𓀴the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in
7457𓀴one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a
7458𓀴dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,
7459𓀴with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the
7460𓀴room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round
7461𓀴and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
7462𓀴and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of
7463𓀴the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,
7464𓀴while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in
7465𓀴every detail of the apartment.
7466𓀴
7467𓀴“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a
7468𓀴thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually
7469𓀴lying upon the pillow.
7470𓀴
7471𓀴“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”
7472𓀴
7473𓀴“It looks newer than the other things?”
7474𓀴
7475𓀴“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”
7476𓀴
7477𓀴“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”
7478𓀴
7479𓀴“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
7480𓀴wanted for ourselves.”
7481𓀴
7482𓀴“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You
7483𓀴will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this
7484𓀴floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
7485𓀴and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks
7486𓀴between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which
7487𓀴the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent
7488𓀴some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.
7489𓀴Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
7490𓀴
7491𓀴“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.
7492𓀴
7493𓀴“Won’t it ring?”
7494𓀴
7495𓀴“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You
7496𓀴can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little
7497𓀴opening for the ventilator is.”
7498𓀴
7499𓀴“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”
7500𓀴
7501𓀴“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or
7502𓀴two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a
7503𓀴builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the
7504𓀴same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”
7505𓀴
7506𓀴“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.
7507𓀴
7508𓀴“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.
7509𓀴
7510𓀴“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”
7511𓀴
7512𓀴“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy
7513𓀴bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
7514𓀴permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the
7515𓀴inner apartment.”
7516𓀴
7517𓀴Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his
7518𓀴step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden
7519𓀴shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair
7520𓀴beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,
7521𓀴and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.
7522𓀴Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the
7523𓀴keenest interest.
7524𓀴
7525𓀴“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.
7526𓀴
7527𓀴“My stepfather’s business papers.”
7528𓀴
7529𓀴“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”
7530𓀴
7531𓀴“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”
7532𓀴
7533𓀴“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”
7534𓀴
7535𓀴“No. What a strange idea!”
7536𓀴
7537𓀴“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on
7538𓀴the top of it.
7539𓀴
7540𓀴“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”
7541𓀴
7542𓀴“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
7543𓀴saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.
7544𓀴There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down
7545𓀴in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the
7546𓀴greatest attention.
7547𓀴
7548𓀴“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his
7549𓀴lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”
7550𓀴
7551𓀴The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one
7552𓀴corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied
7553𓀴so as to make a loop of whipcord.
7554𓀴
7555𓀴“What do you make of that, Watson?”
7556𓀴
7557𓀴“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”
7558𓀴
7559𓀴“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and
7560𓀴when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I
7561𓀴think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your
7562𓀴permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”
7563𓀴
7564𓀴I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was
7565𓀴when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked
7566𓀴several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself
7567𓀴liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his
7568𓀴reverie.
7569𓀴
7570𓀴“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should
7571𓀴absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”
7572𓀴
7573𓀴“I shall most certainly do so.”
7574𓀴
7575𓀴“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend
7576𓀴upon your compliance.”
7577𓀴
7578𓀴“I assure you that I am in your hands.”
7579𓀴
7580𓀴“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your
7581𓀴room.”
7582𓀴
7583𓀴Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
7584𓀴
7585𓀴“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village
7586𓀴inn over there?”
7587𓀴
7588𓀴“Yes, that is the Crown.”
7589𓀴
7590𓀴“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”
7591𓀴
7592𓀴“Certainly.”
7593𓀴
7594𓀴“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
7595𓀴when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the
7596𓀴night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put
7597𓀴your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with
7598𓀴everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to
7599𓀴occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage
7600𓀴there for one night.”
7601𓀴
7602𓀴“Oh, yes, easily.”
7603𓀴
7604𓀴“The rest you will leave in our hands.”
7605𓀴
7606𓀴“But what will you do?”
7607𓀴
7608𓀴“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the
7609𓀴cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”
7610𓀴
7611𓀴“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said
7612𓀴Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.
7613𓀴
7614𓀴“Perhaps I have.”
7615𓀴
7616𓀴“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s
7617𓀴death.”
7618𓀴
7619𓀴“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”
7620𓀴
7621𓀴“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she
7622𓀴died from some sudden fright.”
7623𓀴
7624𓀴“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
7625𓀴tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.
7626𓀴Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and
7627𓀴be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured
7628𓀴that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”
7629𓀴
7630𓀴Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
7631𓀴sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from
7632𓀴our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the
7633𓀴inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby
7634𓀴Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure
7635𓀴of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing
7636𓀴the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s
7637𓀴voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.
7638𓀴The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring
7639𓀴up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
7640𓀴
7641𓀴“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering
7642𓀴darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There
7643𓀴is a distinct element of danger.”
7644𓀴
7645𓀴“Can I be of assistance?”
7646𓀴
7647𓀴“Your presence might be invaluable.”
7648𓀴
7649𓀴“Then I shall certainly come.”
7650𓀴
7651𓀴“It is very kind of you.”
7652𓀴
7653𓀴“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than
7654𓀴was visible to me.”
7655𓀴
7656𓀴“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that
7657𓀴you saw all that I did.”
7658𓀴
7659𓀴“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that
7660𓀴could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”
7661𓀴
7662𓀴“You saw the ventilator, too?”
7663𓀴
7664𓀴“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a
7665𓀴small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could
7666𓀴hardly pass through.”
7667𓀴
7668𓀴“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke
7669𓀴Moran.”
7670𓀴
7671𓀴“My dear Holmes!”
7672𓀴
7673𓀴“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister
7674𓀴could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once
7675𓀴that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only
7676𓀴be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s
7677𓀴inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”
7678𓀴
7679𓀴“But what harm can there be in that?”
7680𓀴
7681𓀴“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator
7682𓀴is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does
7683𓀴not that strike you?”
7684𓀴
7685𓀴“I cannot as yet see any connection.”
7686𓀴
7687𓀴“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”
7688𓀴
7689𓀴“No.”
7690𓀴
7691𓀴“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that
7692𓀴before?”
7693𓀴
7694𓀴“I cannot say that I have.”
7695𓀴
7696𓀴“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
7697𓀴relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call
7698𓀴it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”
7699𓀴
7700𓀴“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are
7701𓀴only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”
7702𓀴
7703𓀴“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is
7704𓀴the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and
7705𓀴Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes
7706𓀴even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike
7707𓀴deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is
7708𓀴over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds
7709𓀴for a few hours to something more cheerful.”
7710𓀴
7711𓀴About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all
7712𓀴was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly
7713𓀴away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright
7714𓀴light shone out right in front of us.
7715𓀴
7716𓀴“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes
7717𓀴from the middle window.”
7718𓀴
7719𓀴As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining
7720𓀴that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was
7721𓀴possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were
7722𓀴out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow
7723𓀴light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our
7724𓀴sombre errand.
7725𓀴
7726𓀴There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired
7727𓀴breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we
7728𓀴reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the
7729𓀴window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed
7730𓀴to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass
7731𓀴with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the
7732𓀴darkness.
7733𓀴
7734𓀴“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”
7735𓀴
7736𓀴Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice
7737𓀴upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put
7738𓀴his lips to my ear.
7739𓀴
7740𓀴“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”
7741𓀴
7742𓀴I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a
7743𓀴cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any
7744𓀴moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following
7745𓀴Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the
7746𓀴bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp
7747𓀴onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had
7748𓀴seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of
7749𓀴his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that
7750𓀴I could do to distinguish the words:
7751𓀴
7752𓀴“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”
7753𓀴
7754𓀴I nodded to show that I had heard.
7755𓀴
7756𓀴“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”
7757𓀴
7758𓀴I nodded again.
7759𓀴
7760𓀴“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol
7761𓀴ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and
7762𓀴you in that chair.”
7763𓀴
7764𓀴I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
7765𓀴
7766𓀴Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed
7767𓀴beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
7768𓀴Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
7769𓀴
7770𓀴How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,
7771𓀴not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat
7772𓀴open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous
7773𓀴tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of
7774𓀴light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
7775𓀴
7776𓀴From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our
7777𓀴very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah
7778𓀴was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the
7779𓀴parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they
7780𓀴seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and
7781𓀴still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
7782𓀴
7783𓀴Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction
7784𓀴of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a
7785𓀴strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room
7786𓀴had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then
7787𓀴all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an
7788𓀴hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became
7789𓀴audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of
7790𓀴steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,
7791𓀴Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
7792𓀴his cane at the bell-pull.
7793𓀴
7794𓀴“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”
7795𓀴
7796𓀴But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a
7797𓀴low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes
7798𓀴made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed
7799𓀴so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and
7800𓀴filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing
7801𓀴up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the
7802𓀴night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled
7803𓀴up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all
7804𓀴mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
7805𓀴village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
7806𓀴sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood
7807𓀴gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died
7808𓀴away into the silence from which it rose.
7809𓀴
7810𓀴“What can it mean?” I gasped.
7811𓀴
7812𓀴“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after
7813𓀴all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.
7814𓀴Roylott’s room.”
7815𓀴
7816𓀴With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.
7817𓀴Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then
7818𓀴he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked
7819𓀴pistol in my hand.
7820𓀴
7821𓀴It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
7822𓀴dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of
7823𓀴light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this
7824𓀴table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long
7825𓀴grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet
7826𓀴thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short
7827𓀴stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin
7828𓀴was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at
7829𓀴the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow
7830𓀴band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
7831𓀴his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
7832𓀴
7833𓀴“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.
7834𓀴
7835𓀴I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to
7836𓀴move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
7837𓀴diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
7838𓀴
7839𓀴“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He
7840𓀴has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,
7841𓀴recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he
7842𓀴digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we
7843𓀴can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county
7844𓀴police know what has happened.”
7845𓀴
7846𓀴As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and
7847𓀴throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid
7848𓀴perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,
7849𓀴which he closed upon it.
7850𓀴
7851𓀴Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke
7852𓀴Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has
7853𓀴already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news
7854𓀴to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the
7855𓀴care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official
7856𓀴inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while
7857𓀴indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet
7858𓀴to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled
7859𓀴back next day.
7860𓀴
7861𓀴“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
7862𓀴shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
7863𓀴insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word
7864𓀴‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the
7865𓀴appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of
7866𓀴her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I
7867𓀴can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position
7868𓀴when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an
7869𓀴occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.
7870𓀴My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to
7871𓀴this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
7872𓀴discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the
7873𓀴floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as
7874𓀴a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.
7875𓀴The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it
7876𓀴with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of
7877𓀴creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.
7878𓀴The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be
7879𓀴discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a
7880𓀴clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity
7881𓀴with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point
7882𓀴of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who
7883𓀴could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
7884𓀴the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of
7885𓀴course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to
7886𓀴the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we
7887𓀴saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this
7888𓀴ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it
7889𓀴would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not
7890𓀴bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
7891𓀴sooner or later she must fall a victim.
7892𓀴
7893𓀴“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An
7894𓀴inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of
7895𓀴standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he
7896𓀴should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,
7897𓀴and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which
7898𓀴may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was
7899𓀴obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe
7900𓀴upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the
7901𓀴steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the
7902𓀴creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit
7903𓀴the light and attacked it.”
7904𓀴
7905𓀴“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”
7906𓀴
7907𓀴“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the
7908𓀴other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its
7909𓀴snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this
7910𓀴way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s
7911𓀴death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my
7912𓀴conscience.”

7917𓀴IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB
7918𓀴
7919𓀴
7920𓀴Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
7921𓀴Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there
7922𓀴were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that
7923𓀴of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of
7924𓀴these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and
7925𓀴original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so
7926𓀴dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed
7927𓀴upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those
7928𓀴deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable
7929𓀴results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the
7930𓀴newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less
7931𓀴striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than
7932𓀴when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery
7933𓀴clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which
7934𓀴leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
7935𓀴deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served
7936𓀴to weaken the effect.
7937𓀴
7938𓀴It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the
7939𓀴events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to
7940𓀴civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street
7941𓀴rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even
7942𓀴persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit
7943𓀴us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no
7944𓀴very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from
7945𓀴among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and
7946𓀴lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of
7947𓀴endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any
7948𓀴influence.
7949𓀴
7950𓀴One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the
7951𓀴maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from
7952𓀴Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed
7953𓀴hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom
7954𓀴trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the
7955𓀴guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
7956𓀴
7957𓀴“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;
7958𓀴“he’s all right.”
7959𓀴
7960𓀴“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some
7961𓀴strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
7962𓀴
7963𓀴“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round
7964𓀴myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I
7965𓀴must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off
7966𓀴he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
7967𓀴
7968𓀴I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.
7969𓀴He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
7970𓀴which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a
7971𓀴handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He
7972𓀴was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,
7973𓀴masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression
7974𓀴of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took
7975𓀴all his strength of mind to control.
7976𓀴
7977𓀴“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had
7978𓀴a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this
7979𓀴morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a
7980𓀴doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a
7981𓀴card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”
7982𓀴
7983𓀴I took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
7984𓀴engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,
7985𓀴and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you
7986𓀴waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from
7987𓀴a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous
7988𓀴occupation.”
7989𓀴
7990𓀴“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He
7991𓀴laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his
7992𓀴chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against
7993𓀴that laugh.
7994𓀴
7995𓀴“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some
7996𓀴water from a caraffe.
7997𓀴
7998𓀴It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
7999𓀴outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is
8000𓀴over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and
8001𓀴pale-looking.
8002𓀴
8003𓀴“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.
8004𓀴
8005𓀴“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the
8006𓀴colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
8007𓀴
8008𓀴“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly
8009𓀴attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”
8010𓀴
8011𓀴He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my
8012𓀴hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding
8013𓀴fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have
8014𓀴been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
8015𓀴
8016𓀴“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled
8017𓀴considerably.”
8018𓀴
8019𓀴“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have
8020𓀴been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was
8021𓀴still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round
8022𓀴the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”
8023𓀴
8024𓀴“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”
8025𓀴
8026𓀴“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
8027𓀴province.”
8028𓀴
8029𓀴“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and
8030𓀴sharp instrument.”
8031𓀴
8032𓀴“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.
8033𓀴
8034𓀴“An accident, I presume?”
8035𓀴
8036𓀴“By no means.”
8037𓀴
8038𓀴“What! a murderous attack?”
8039𓀴
8040𓀴“Very murderous indeed.”
8041𓀴
8042𓀴“You horrify me.”
8043𓀴
8044𓀴I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it
8045𓀴over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without
8046𓀴wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
8047𓀴
8048𓀴“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.
8049𓀴
8050𓀴“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was
8051𓀴very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”
8052𓀴
8053𓀴“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying
8054𓀴to your nerves.”
8055𓀴
8056𓀴“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,
8057𓀴between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
8058𓀴wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for
8059𓀴it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof
8060𓀴with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which
8061𓀴I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will
8062𓀴be done.”
8063𓀴
8064𓀴“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you
8065𓀴desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my
8066𓀴friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”
8067𓀴
8068𓀴“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should
8069𓀴be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must
8070𓀴use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to
8071𓀴him?”
8072𓀴
8073𓀴“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”
8074𓀴
8075𓀴“I should be immensely obliged to you.”
8076𓀴
8077𓀴“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a
8078𓀴little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”
8079𓀴
8080𓀴“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”
8081𓀴
8082𓀴“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
8083𓀴instant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,
8084𓀴and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new
8085𓀴acquaintance to Baker Street.
8086𓀴
8087𓀴Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in
8088𓀴his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking
8089𓀴his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and
8090𓀴dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and
8091𓀴collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his
8092𓀴quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us
8093𓀴in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance
8094𓀴upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
8095𓀴brandy and water within his reach.
8096𓀴
8097𓀴“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.
8098𓀴Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely
8099𓀴at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up
8100𓀴your strength with a little stimulant.”
8101𓀴
8102𓀴“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the
8103𓀴doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the
8104𓀴cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I
8105𓀴shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”
8106𓀴
8107𓀴Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
8108𓀴which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,
8109𓀴and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor
8110𓀴detailed to us.
8111𓀴
8112𓀴“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing
8113𓀴alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,
8114𓀴and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven
8115𓀴years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,
8116𓀴of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also
8117𓀴come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I
8118𓀴determined to start in business for myself and took professional
8119𓀴chambers in Victoria Street.
8120𓀴
8121𓀴“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business
8122𓀴a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two
8123𓀴years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is
8124𓀴absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings
8125𓀴amount to £ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in
8126𓀴the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began
8127𓀴to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at
8128𓀴all.
8129𓀴
8130𓀴“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my
8131𓀴clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me
8132𓀴upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel
8133𓀴Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel
8134𓀴himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding
8135𓀴thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole
8136𓀴face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was
8137𓀴drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation
8138𓀴seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was
8139𓀴bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but
8140𓀴neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
8141𓀴thirty.
8142𓀴
8143𓀴“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have
8144𓀴been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only
8145𓀴proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of
8146𓀴preserving a secret.’
8147𓀴
8148𓀴“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
8149𓀴address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’
8150𓀴
8151𓀴“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at
8152𓀴this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan
8153𓀴and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’
8154𓀴
8155𓀴“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say
8156𓀴that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
8157𓀴qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that
8158𓀴you wished to speak to me?’
8159𓀴
8160𓀴“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the
8161𓀴point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy
8162𓀴is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we
8163𓀴may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in
8164𓀴the bosom of his family.’
8165𓀴
8166𓀴“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend
8167𓀴upon my doing so.’
8168𓀴
8169𓀴“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had
8170𓀴never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
8171𓀴
8172𓀴“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.
8173𓀴
8174𓀴“‘Yes, I promise.’
8175𓀴
8176𓀴“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference
8177𓀴to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’
8178𓀴
8179𓀴“‘I have already given you my word.’
8180𓀴
8181𓀴“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across
8182𓀴the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
8183𓀴
8184𓀴“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are
8185𓀴sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in
8186𓀴safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at
8187𓀴me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
8188𓀴
8189𓀴“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to
8190𓀴rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my
8191𓀴dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my
8192𓀴impatience.
8193𓀴
8194𓀴“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of
8195𓀴value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to
8196𓀴my lips.
8197𓀴
8198𓀴“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.
8199𓀴
8200𓀴“‘Most admirably.’
8201𓀴
8202𓀴“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I
8203𓀴simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has
8204𓀴got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it
8205𓀴right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’
8206𓀴
8207𓀴“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’
8208𓀴
8209𓀴“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’
8210𓀴
8211𓀴“‘Where to?’
8212𓀴
8213𓀴“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of
8214𓀴Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from
8215𓀴Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’
8216𓀴
8217𓀴“‘Very good.’
8218𓀴
8219𓀴“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’
8220𓀴
8221𓀴“‘There is a drive, then?’
8222𓀴
8223𓀴“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven
8224𓀴miles from Eyford Station.’
8225𓀴
8226𓀴“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would
8227𓀴be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’
8228𓀴
8229𓀴“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’
8230𓀴
8231𓀴“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’
8232𓀴
8233𓀴“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense
8234𓀴you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and
8235𓀴unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of
8236𓀴your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the
8237𓀴business, there is plenty of time to do so.’
8238𓀴
8239𓀴“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be
8240𓀴to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate
8241𓀴myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little
8242𓀴more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’
8243𓀴
8244𓀴“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have
8245𓀴exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to
8246𓀴commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I
8247𓀴suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’
8248𓀴
8249𓀴“‘Entirely.’
8250𓀴
8251𓀴“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
8252𓀴fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one
8253𓀴or two places in England?’
8254𓀴
8255𓀴“‘I have heard so.’
8256𓀴
8257𓀴“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within
8258𓀴ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was
8259𓀴a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,
8260𓀴however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and
8261𓀴that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
8262𓀴and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These
8263𓀴good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that
8264𓀴which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
8265𓀴interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but
8266𓀴unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few
8267𓀴of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we
8268𓀴should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in
8269𓀴this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the
8270𓀴neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in
8271𓀴order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This
8272𓀴press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish
8273𓀴your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,
8274𓀴however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers
8275𓀴coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if
8276𓀴the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
8277𓀴fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise
8278𓀴me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford
8279𓀴to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’
8280𓀴
8281𓀴“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite
8282𓀴understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in
8283𓀴excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like
8284𓀴gravel from a pit.’
8285𓀴
8286𓀴“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the
8287𓀴earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they
8288𓀴are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my
8289𓀴confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’
8290𓀴He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’
8291𓀴
8292𓀴“‘I shall certainly be there.’
8293𓀴
8294𓀴“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long,
8295𓀴questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he
8296𓀴hurried from the room.
8297𓀴
8298𓀴“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much
8299𓀴astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had
8300𓀴been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the
8301𓀴fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price
8302𓀴upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to
8303𓀴other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had
8304𓀴made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his
8305𓀴explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the
8306𓀴necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I
8307𓀴should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the
8308𓀴winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,
8309𓀴having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
8310𓀴
8311𓀴“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
8312𓀴However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the
8313𓀴little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger
8314𓀴who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single
8315𓀴sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,
8316𓀴however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow
8317𓀴upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me
8318𓀴into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the
8319𓀴windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as
8320𓀴fast as the horse could go.”
8321𓀴
8322𓀴“One horse?” interjected Holmes.
8323𓀴
8324𓀴“Yes, only one.”
8325𓀴
8326𓀴“Did you observe the colour?”
8327𓀴
8328𓀴“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
8329𓀴carriage. It was a chestnut.”
8330𓀴
8331𓀴“Tired-looking or fresh?”
8332𓀴
8333𓀴“Oh, fresh and glossy.”
8334𓀴
8335𓀴“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most
8336𓀴interesting statement.”
8337𓀴
8338𓀴“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander
8339𓀴Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from
8340𓀴the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it
8341𓀴must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the
8342𓀴time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,
8343𓀴that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem
8344𓀴to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and
8345𓀴jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of
8346𓀴where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make
8347𓀴out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and
8348𓀴then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but
8349𓀴the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon
8350𓀴flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for
8351𓀴the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a
8352𓀴stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,
8353𓀴pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,
8354𓀴as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I
8355𓀴failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The
8356𓀴instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily
8357𓀴behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
8358𓀴drove away.
8359𓀴
8360𓀴“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about
8361𓀴looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door
8362𓀴opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light
8363𓀴shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a
8364𓀴lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face
8365𓀴forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from
8366𓀴the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it
8367𓀴was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a
8368𓀴tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
8369𓀴gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from
8370𓀴her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,
8371𓀴and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he
8372𓀴walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
8373𓀴
8374𓀴“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few
8375𓀴minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,
8376𓀴plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which
8377𓀴several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp
8378𓀴on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you
8379𓀴waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.
8380𓀴
8381𓀴“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of
8382𓀴German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the
8383𓀴others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,
8384𓀴hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak
8385𓀴shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully
8386𓀴silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the
8387𓀴passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of
8388𓀴uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and
8389𓀴what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
8390𓀴where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I
8391𓀴knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that
8392𓀴matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that
8393𓀴radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was
8394𓀴quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the
8395𓀴country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath
8396𓀴to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my
8397𓀴fifty-guinea fee.
8398𓀴
8399𓀴“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter
8400𓀴stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was
8401𓀴standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the
8402𓀴yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I
8403𓀴could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a
8404𓀴chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be
8405𓀴silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her
8406𓀴eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom
8407𓀴behind her.
8408𓀴
8409𓀴“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak
8410𓀴calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you
8411𓀴to do.’
8412𓀴
8413𓀴“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot
8414𓀴possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’
8415𓀴
8416𓀴“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass
8417𓀴through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and
8418𓀴shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step
8419𓀴forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she
8420𓀴whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’
8421𓀴
8422𓀴“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage
8423𓀴in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my
8424𓀴fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night
8425𓀴which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should
8426𓀴I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the
8427𓀴payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a
8428𓀴monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had
8429𓀴shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and
8430𓀴declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew
8431𓀴her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several
8432𓀴footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw
8433𓀴up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as
8434𓀴noiselessly as she had come.
8435𓀴
8436𓀴“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a
8437𓀴chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was
8438𓀴introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
8439𓀴
8440𓀴“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I
8441𓀴was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear
8442𓀴that you have felt the draught.’
8443𓀴
8444𓀴“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt
8445𓀴the room to be a little close.’
8446𓀴
8447𓀴“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better
8448𓀴proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you
8449𓀴up to see the machine.’
8450𓀴
8451𓀴“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’
8452𓀴
8453𓀴“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’
8454𓀴
8455𓀴“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’
8456𓀴
8457𓀴“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All
8458𓀴we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is
8459𓀴wrong with it.’
8460𓀴
8461𓀴“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat
8462𓀴manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with
8463𓀴corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,
8464𓀴the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had
8465𓀴crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above
8466𓀴the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the
8467𓀴damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put
8468𓀴on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the
8469𓀴warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen
8470𓀴eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
8471𓀴man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least
8472𓀴a fellow-countryman.
8473𓀴
8474𓀴“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he
8475𓀴unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us
8476𓀴could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the
8477𓀴colonel ushered me in.
8478𓀴
8479𓀴“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it
8480𓀴would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn
8481𓀴it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the
8482𓀴descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon
8483𓀴this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside
8484𓀴which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the
8485𓀴manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but
8486𓀴there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little
8487𓀴of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to
8488𓀴show us how we can set it right.’
8489𓀴
8490𓀴“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.
8491𓀴It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous
8492𓀴pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers
8493𓀴which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there
8494𓀴was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through
8495𓀴one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the
8496𓀴india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk
8497𓀴so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was
8498𓀴clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my
8499𓀴companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several
8500𓀴practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When
8501𓀴I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
8502𓀴machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was
8503𓀴obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest
8504𓀴fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an
8505𓀴engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of
8506𓀴wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came
8507𓀴to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I
8508𓀴had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I
8509𓀴heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of
8510𓀴the colonel looking down at me.
8511𓀴
8512𓀴“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.
8513𓀴
8514𓀴“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that
8515𓀴which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I
8516𓀴think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if
8517𓀴I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’
8518𓀴
8519𓀴“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my
8520𓀴speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey
8521𓀴eyes.
8522𓀴
8523𓀴“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took
8524𓀴a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the
8525𓀴lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite
8526𓀴secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’
8527𓀴I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’
8528𓀴
8529𓀴“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart
8530𓀴into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the
8531𓀴leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood
8532𓀴upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its
8533𓀴light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
8534𓀴jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must
8535𓀴within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,
8536𓀴screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I
8537𓀴implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the
8538𓀴levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my
8539𓀴head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.
8540𓀴Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
8541𓀴very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the
8542𓀴weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that
8543𓀴dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve
8544𓀴to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
8545𓀴Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which
8546𓀴brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
8547𓀴
8548𓀴“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls
8549𓀴were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line
8550𓀴of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and
8551𓀴broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could
8552𓀴hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.
8553𓀴The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the
8554𓀴other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the
8555𓀴lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,
8556𓀴told me how narrow had been my escape.
8557𓀴
8558𓀴“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I
8559𓀴found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a
8560𓀴woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held
8561𓀴a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had
8562𓀴so foolishly rejected.
8563𓀴
8564𓀴“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.
8565𓀴They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious
8566𓀴time, but come!’
8567𓀴
8568𓀴“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my
8569𓀴feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The
8570𓀴latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard
8571𓀴the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering
8572𓀴the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My
8573𓀴guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.
8574𓀴Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window
8575𓀴of which the moon was shining brightly.
8576𓀴
8577𓀴“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that
8578𓀴you can jump it.’
8579𓀴
8580𓀴“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
8581𓀴passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing
8582𓀴forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s
8583𓀴cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the
8584𓀴window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden
8585𓀴looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet
8586𓀴down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I
8587𓀴should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who
8588𓀴pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to
8589𓀴go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my
8590𓀴mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw
8591𓀴her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
8592𓀴
8593𓀴“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the
8594𓀴last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he
8595𓀴will be silent!’
8596𓀴
8597𓀴“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.
8598𓀴‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’
8599𓀴He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with
8600𓀴his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to
8601𓀴the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip
8602𓀴loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
8603𓀴
8604𓀴“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
8605𓀴rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood
8606𓀴that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I
8607𓀴ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my
8608𓀴hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw
8609𓀴that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my
8610𓀴wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a
8611𓀴sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among
8612𓀴the rose-bushes.
8613𓀴
8614𓀴“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a
8615𓀴very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
8616𓀴breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,
8617𓀴and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The
8618𓀴smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s
8619𓀴adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly
8620𓀴yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to
8621𓀴look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been
8622𓀴lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little
8623𓀴lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,
8624𓀴to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.
8625𓀴Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during
8626𓀴those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
8627𓀴
8628𓀴“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.
8629𓀴There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was
8630𓀴on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him
8631𓀴whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was
8632𓀴strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for
8633𓀴me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was
8634𓀴one about three miles off.
8635𓀴
8636𓀴“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to
8637𓀴wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It
8638𓀴was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound
8639𓀴dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I
8640𓀴put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”
8641𓀴
8642𓀴We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this
8643𓀴extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the
8644𓀴shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his
8645𓀴cuttings.
8646𓀴
8647𓀴“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It
8648𓀴appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on
8649𓀴the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic
8650𓀴engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been
8651𓀴heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the
8652𓀴last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I
8653𓀴fancy.”
8654𓀴
8655𓀴“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl
8656𓀴said.”
8657𓀴
8658𓀴“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
8659𓀴desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand
8660𓀴in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will
8661𓀴leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is
8662𓀴precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard
8663𓀴at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”
8664𓀴
8665𓀴Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
8666𓀴bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock
8667𓀴Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,
8668𓀴a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map
8669𓀴of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing
8670𓀴a circle with Eyford for its centre.
8671𓀴
8672𓀴“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten
8673𓀴miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that
8674𓀴line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”
8675𓀴
8676𓀴“It was an hour’s good drive.”
8677𓀴
8678𓀴“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were
8679𓀴unconscious?”
8680𓀴
8681𓀴“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been
8682𓀴lifted and conveyed somewhere.”
8683𓀴
8684𓀴“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you
8685𓀴when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain
8686𓀴was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”
8687𓀴
8688𓀴“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my
8689𓀴life.”
8690𓀴
8691𓀴“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have
8692𓀴drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk
8693𓀴that we are in search of are to be found.”
8694𓀴
8695𓀴“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.
8696𓀴
8697𓀴“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!
8698𓀴Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the
8699𓀴country is more deserted there.”
8700𓀴
8701𓀴“And I say east,” said my patient.
8702𓀴
8703𓀴“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several
8704𓀴quiet little villages up there.”
8705𓀴
8706𓀴“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and
8707𓀴our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”
8708𓀴
8709𓀴“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of
8710𓀴opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your
8711𓀴casting vote to?”
8712𓀴
8713𓀴“You are all wrong.”
8714𓀴
8715𓀴“But we can’t all be.”
8716𓀴
8717𓀴“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the
8718𓀴centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”
8719𓀴
8720𓀴“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.
8721𓀴
8722𓀴“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse
8723𓀴was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had
8724𓀴gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”
8725𓀴
8726𓀴“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.
8727𓀴“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”
8728𓀴
8729𓀴“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and
8730𓀴have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of
8731𓀴silver.”
8732𓀴
8733𓀴“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the
8734𓀴inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We
8735𓀴even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they
8736𓀴had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old
8737𓀴hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got
8738𓀴them right enough.”
8739𓀴
8740𓀴But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined
8741𓀴to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we
8742𓀴saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small
8743𓀴clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich
8744𓀴feather over the landscape.
8745𓀴
8746𓀴“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on
8747𓀴its way.
8748𓀴
8749𓀴“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.
8750𓀴
8751𓀴“When did it break out?”
8752𓀴
8753𓀴“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and
8754𓀴the whole place is in a blaze.”
8755𓀴
8756𓀴“Whose house is it?”
8757𓀴
8758𓀴“Dr. Becher’s.”
8759𓀴
8760𓀴“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,
8761𓀴with a long, sharp nose?”
8762𓀴
8763𓀴The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
8764𓀴Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined
8765𓀴waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I
8766𓀴understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good
8767𓀴Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”
8768𓀴
8769𓀴The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
8770𓀴hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and
8771𓀴there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,
8772𓀴spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front
8773𓀴three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
8774𓀴
8775𓀴“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the
8776𓀴gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second
8777𓀴window is the one that I jumped from.”
8778𓀴
8779𓀴“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.
8780𓀴There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was
8781𓀴crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt
8782𓀴they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.
8783𓀴Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,
8784𓀴though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”
8785𓀴
8786𓀴And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no
8787𓀴word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister
8788𓀴German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met
8789𓀴a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving
8790𓀴rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the
8791𓀴fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to
8792𓀴discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
8793𓀴
8794𓀴The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
8795𓀴they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed
8796𓀴human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,
8797𓀴however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the
8798𓀴flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been
8799𓀴reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and
8800𓀴iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our
8801𓀴unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin
8802𓀴were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,
8803𓀴which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have
8804𓀴been already referred to.
8805𓀴
8806𓀴How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the
8807𓀴spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a
8808𓀴mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain
8809𓀴tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom
8810𓀴had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the
8811𓀴whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold
8812𓀴or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear
8813𓀴the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
8814𓀴
8815𓀴“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once
8816𓀴more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my
8817𓀴thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”
8818𓀴
8819𓀴“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,
8820𓀴you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of
8821𓀴being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”
8822𓀴
8823𓀴
8824𓀴
8825𓀴
8826𓀴X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
8827𓀴
8828𓀴
8829𓀴The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long
8830𓀴ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which
8831𓀴the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and
8832𓀴their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this
8833𓀴four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the
8834𓀴full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my
8835𓀴friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter
8836𓀴up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little
8837𓀴sketch of this remarkable episode.
8838𓀴
8839𓀴It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was
8840𓀴still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from
8841𓀴an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I
8842𓀴had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn
8843𓀴to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had
8844𓀴brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign
8845𓀴throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my
8846𓀴legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
8847𓀴until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all
8848𓀴aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
8849𓀴envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble
8850𓀴correspondent could be.
8851𓀴
8852𓀴“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your
8853𓀴morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
8854𓀴tide-waiter.”
8855𓀴
8856𓀴“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he
8857𓀴answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
8858𓀴This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
8859𓀴a man either to be bored or to lie.”
8860𓀴
8861𓀴He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
8862𓀴
8863𓀴“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”
8864𓀴
8865𓀴“Not social, then?”
8866𓀴
8867𓀴“No, distinctly professional.”
8868𓀴
8869𓀴“And from a noble client?”
8870𓀴
8871𓀴“One of the highest in England.”
8872𓀴
8873𓀴“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”
8874𓀴
8875𓀴“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
8876𓀴client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
8877𓀴It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this
8878𓀴new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,
8879𓀴have you not?”
8880𓀴
8881𓀴“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
8882𓀴corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”
8883𓀴
8884𓀴“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read
8885𓀴nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is
8886𓀴always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely
8887𓀴you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”
8888𓀴
8889𓀴“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”
8890𓀴
8891𓀴“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.
8892𓀴Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
8893𓀴papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he
8894𓀴says:
8895𓀴
8896𓀴    “‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may
8897𓀴    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have
8898𓀴    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
8899𓀴    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
8900𓀴    connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
8901𓀴    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
8902𓀴    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it
8903𓀴    might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the
8904𓀴    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,
8905𓀴    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount
8906𓀴    importance. Yours faithfully,
8907𓀴
8908𓀴
8909𓀴    “‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’
8910𓀴
8911𓀴
8912𓀴“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
8913𓀴noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
8914𓀴side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the
8915𓀴epistle.
8916𓀴
8917𓀴“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”
8918𓀴
8919𓀴“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
8920𓀴subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order
8921𓀴of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a
8922𓀴red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the
8923𓀴mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out
8924𓀴upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son
8925𓀴of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief
8926𓀴over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is
8927𓀴mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late
8928𓀴administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for
8929𓀴Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
8930𓀴Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive
8931𓀴in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more
8932𓀴solid.”
8933𓀴
8934𓀴“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for
8935𓀴the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I
8936𓀴feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry
8937𓀴on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”
8938𓀴
8939𓀴“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.
8940𓀴That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the
8941𓀴first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”
8942𓀴
8943𓀴“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
8944𓀴column of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:
8945𓀴‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is
8946𓀴correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second
8947𓀴son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of
8948𓀴Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”
8949𓀴
8950𓀴“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin
8951𓀴legs towards the fire.
8952𓀴
8953𓀴“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of
8954𓀴the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for
8955𓀴protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade
8956𓀴principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one
8957𓀴the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the
8958𓀴hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important
8959𓀴addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
8960𓀴which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,
8961𓀴who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little
8962𓀴god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage
8963𓀴with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California
8964𓀴millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face
8965𓀴attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only
8966𓀴child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
8967𓀴considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As
8968𓀴it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to
8969𓀴sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has
8970𓀴no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is
8971𓀴obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
8972𓀴alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
8973𓀴from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”
8974𓀴
8975𓀴“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.
8976𓀴
8977𓀴“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to
8978𓀴say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
8979𓀴be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
8980𓀴friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
8981𓀴furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius
8982𓀴Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt
8983𓀴announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon
8984𓀴would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are
8985𓀴all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”
8986𓀴
8987𓀴“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.
8988𓀴
8989𓀴“The vanishing of the lady.”
8990𓀴
8991𓀴“When did she vanish, then?”
8992𓀴
8993𓀴“At the wedding breakfast.”
8994𓀴
8995𓀴“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
8996𓀴dramatic, in fact.”
8997𓀴
8998𓀴“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”
8999𓀴
9000𓀴“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
9001𓀴honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
9002𓀴Pray let me have the details.”
9003𓀴
9004𓀴“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”
9005𓀴
9006𓀴“Perhaps we may make them less so.”
9007𓀴
9008𓀴“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
9009𓀴paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular
9010𓀴Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:
9011𓀴
9012𓀴“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest
9013𓀴consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken
9014𓀴place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly
9015𓀴announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;
9016𓀴but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange
9017𓀴rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the
9018𓀴attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention
9019𓀴has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by
9020𓀴affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
9021𓀴
9022𓀴“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
9023𓀴was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the
9024𓀴bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,
9025𓀴Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister
9026𓀴of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party
9027𓀴proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster
9028𓀴Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little
9029𓀴trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who
9030𓀴endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
9031𓀴alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after
9032𓀴a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and
9033𓀴the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before
9034𓀴this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
9035𓀴when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
9036𓀴Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed
9037𓀴her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber
9038𓀴for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the
9039𓀴passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the
9040𓀴house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
9041𓀴mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that
9042𓀴his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
9043𓀴the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the
9044𓀴police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will
9045𓀴probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
9046𓀴Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the
9047𓀴whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the
9048𓀴matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the
9049𓀴woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from
9050𓀴jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the
9051𓀴strange disappearance of the bride.’”
9052𓀴
9053𓀴“And is that all?”
9054𓀴
9055𓀴“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
9056𓀴suggestive one.”
9057𓀴
9058𓀴“And it is—”
9059𓀴
9060𓀴“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
9061𓀴actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_
9062𓀴at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
9063𓀴There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands
9064𓀴now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”
9065𓀴
9066𓀴“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have
9067𓀴missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as
9068𓀴the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this
9069𓀴will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I
9070𓀴very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own
9071𓀴memory.”
9072𓀴
9073𓀴“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the
9074𓀴door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed
9075𓀴and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with
9076𓀴the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever
9077𓀴been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his
9078𓀴general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight
9079𓀴forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,
9080𓀴too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the
9081𓀴edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the
9082𓀴verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
9083𓀴waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured
9084𓀴gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left
9085𓀴to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden
9086𓀴eyeglasses.
9087𓀴
9088𓀴“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take
9089𓀴the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up
9090𓀴a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”
9091𓀴
9092𓀴“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.
9093𓀴Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have
9094𓀴already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I
9095𓀴presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”
9096𓀴
9097𓀴“No, I am descending.”
9098𓀴
9099𓀴“I beg pardon.”
9100𓀴
9101𓀴“My last client of the sort was a king.”
9102𓀴
9103𓀴“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”
9104𓀴
9105𓀴“The King of Scandinavia.”
9106𓀴
9107𓀴“What! Had he lost his wife?”
9108𓀴
9109𓀴“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the
9110𓀴affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in
9111𓀴yours.”
9112𓀴
9113𓀴“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own
9114𓀴case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
9115𓀴forming an opinion.”
9116𓀴
9117𓀴“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,
9118𓀴nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for
9119𓀴example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”
9120𓀴
9121𓀴Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it
9122𓀴goes.”
9123𓀴
9124𓀴“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer
9125𓀴an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by
9126𓀴questioning you.”
9127𓀴
9128𓀴“Pray do so.”
9129𓀴
9130𓀴“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”
9131𓀴
9132𓀴“In San Francisco, a year ago.”
9133𓀴
9134𓀴“You were travelling in the States?”
9135𓀴
9136𓀴“Yes.”
9137𓀴
9138𓀴“Did you become engaged then?”
9139𓀴
9140𓀴“No.”
9141𓀴
9142𓀴“But you were on a friendly footing?”
9143𓀴
9144𓀴“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”
9145𓀴
9146𓀴“Her father is very rich?”
9147𓀴
9148𓀴“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”
9149𓀴
9150𓀴“And how did he make his money?”
9151𓀴
9152𓀴“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
9153𓀴invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”
9154𓀴
9155𓀴“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s
9156𓀴character?”
9157𓀴
9158𓀴The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
9159𓀴fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her
9160𓀴father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining
9161𓀴camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has
9162𓀴come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call
9163𓀴in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by
9164𓀴any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.
9165𓀴She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
9166𓀴resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name
9167𓀴which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I
9168𓀴not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is
9169𓀴capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would
9170𓀴be repugnant to her.”
9171𓀴
9172𓀴“Have you her photograph?”
9173𓀴
9174𓀴“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full
9175𓀴face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory
9176𓀴miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the
9177𓀴lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
9178𓀴Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and
9179𓀴handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
9180𓀴
9181𓀴“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
9182𓀴acquaintance?”
9183𓀴
9184𓀴“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met
9185𓀴her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”
9186𓀴
9187𓀴“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”
9188𓀴
9189𓀴“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”
9190𓀴
9191𓀴“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait
9192𓀴accompli_?”
9193𓀴
9194𓀴“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”
9195𓀴
9196𓀴“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
9197𓀴wedding?”
9198𓀴
9199𓀴“Yes.”
9200𓀴
9201𓀴“Was she in good spirits?”
9202𓀴
9203𓀴“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
9204𓀴lives.”
9205𓀴
9206𓀴“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”
9207𓀴
9208𓀴“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”
9209𓀴
9210𓀴“And did you observe any change in her then?”
9211𓀴
9212𓀴“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
9213𓀴seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was
9214𓀴too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”
9215𓀴
9216𓀴“Pray let us have it, for all that.”
9217𓀴
9218𓀴“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
9219𓀴vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
9220𓀴into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew
9221𓀴handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for
9222𓀴the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me
9223𓀴abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
9224𓀴agitated over this trifling cause.”
9225𓀴
9226𓀴“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the
9227𓀴general public were present, then?”
9228𓀴
9229𓀴“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”
9230𓀴
9231𓀴“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”
9232𓀴
9233𓀴“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
9234𓀴common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I
9235𓀴think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”
9236𓀴
9237𓀴“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
9238𓀴frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering
9239𓀴her father’s house?”
9240𓀴
9241𓀴“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”
9242𓀴
9243𓀴“And who is her maid?”
9244𓀴
9245𓀴“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with
9246𓀴her.”
9247𓀴
9248𓀴“A confidential servant?”
9249𓀴
9250𓀴“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
9251𓀴take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
9252𓀴things in a different way.”
9253𓀴
9254𓀴“How long did she speak to this Alice?”
9255𓀴
9256𓀴“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”
9257𓀴
9258𓀴“You did not overhear what they said?”
9259𓀴
9260𓀴“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was
9261𓀴accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”
9262𓀴
9263𓀴“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do
9264𓀴when she finished speaking to her maid?”
9265𓀴
9266𓀴“She walked into the breakfast-room.”
9267𓀴
9268𓀴“On your arm?”
9269𓀴
9270𓀴“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,
9271𓀴after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,
9272𓀴muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came
9273𓀴back.”
9274𓀴
9275𓀴“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her
9276𓀴room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,
9277𓀴and went out.”
9278𓀴
9279𓀴“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
9280𓀴company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had
9281𓀴already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”
9282𓀴
9283𓀴“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
9284𓀴your relations to her.”
9285𓀴
9286𓀴Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have
9287𓀴been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_
9288𓀴friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her
9289𓀴ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but
9290𓀴you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but
9291𓀴exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me
9292𓀴dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to
9293𓀴tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly
9294𓀴was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came
9295𓀴to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push
9296𓀴her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even
9297𓀴threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the
9298𓀴sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon
9299𓀴pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good
9300𓀴in making a row.”
9301𓀴
9302𓀴“Did your wife hear all this?”
9303𓀴
9304𓀴“No, thank goodness, she did not.”
9305𓀴
9306𓀴“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”
9307𓀴
9308𓀴“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so
9309𓀴serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some
9310𓀴terrible trap for her.”
9311𓀴
9312𓀴“Well, it is a possible supposition.”
9313𓀴
9314𓀴“You think so, too?”
9315𓀴
9316𓀴“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this
9317𓀴as likely?”
9318𓀴
9319𓀴“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”
9320𓀴
9321𓀴“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is
9322𓀴your own theory as to what took place?”
9323𓀴
9324𓀴“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have
9325𓀴given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it
9326𓀴has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
9327𓀴consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
9328𓀴effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”
9329𓀴
9330𓀴“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”
9331𓀴
9332𓀴“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not
9333𓀴say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without
9334𓀴success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”
9335𓀴
9336𓀴“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,
9337𓀴smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my
9338𓀴data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that
9339𓀴you could see out of the window?”
9340𓀴
9341𓀴“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”
9342𓀴
9343𓀴“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I
9344𓀴shall communicate with you.”
9345𓀴
9346𓀴“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our
9347𓀴client, rising.
9348𓀴
9349𓀴“I have solved it.”
9350𓀴
9351𓀴“Eh? What was that?”
9352𓀴
9353𓀴“I say that I have solved it.”
9354𓀴
9355𓀴“Where, then, is my wife?”
9356𓀴
9357𓀴“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”
9358𓀴
9359𓀴Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser
9360𓀴heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
9361𓀴old-fashioned manner he departed.
9362𓀴
9363𓀴“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a
9364𓀴level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I
9365𓀴shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this
9366𓀴cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before
9367𓀴our client came into the room.”
9368𓀴
9369𓀴“My dear Holmes!”
9370𓀴
9371𓀴“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked
9372𓀴before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn
9373𓀴my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally
9374𓀴very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote
9375𓀴Thoreau’s example.”
9376𓀴
9377𓀴“But I have heard all that you have heard.”
9378𓀴
9379𓀴“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me
9380𓀴so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and
9381𓀴something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the
9382𓀴Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is
9383𓀴Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon
9384𓀴the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”
9385𓀴
9386𓀴The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which
9387𓀴gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
9388𓀴bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the
9389𓀴cigar which had been offered to him.
9390𓀴
9391𓀴“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look
9392𓀴dissatisfied.”
9393𓀴
9394𓀴“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.
9395𓀴I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”
9396𓀴
9397𓀴“Really! You surprise me.”
9398𓀴
9399𓀴“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
9400𓀴through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”
9401𓀴
9402𓀴“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand
9403𓀴upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
9404𓀴
9405𓀴“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”
9406𓀴
9407𓀴“In Heaven’s name, what for?”
9408𓀴
9409𓀴“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”
9410𓀴
9411𓀴Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
9412𓀴
9413𓀴“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.
9414𓀴
9415𓀴“Why? What do you mean?”
9416𓀴
9417𓀴“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one
9418𓀴as in the other.”
9419𓀴
9420𓀴Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all
9421𓀴about it,” he snarled.
9422𓀴
9423𓀴“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”
9424𓀴
9425𓀴“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the
9426𓀴matter?”
9427𓀴
9428𓀴“I think it very unlikely.”
9429𓀴
9430𓀴“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in
9431𓀴it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a
9432𓀴wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a
9433𓀴bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,”
9434𓀴said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is
9435𓀴a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”
9436𓀴
9437𓀴“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You
9438𓀴dragged them from the Serpentine?”
9439𓀴
9440𓀴“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They
9441𓀴have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the
9442𓀴clothes were there the body would not be far off.”
9443𓀴
9444𓀴“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in
9445𓀴the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive
9446𓀴at through this?”
9447𓀴
9448𓀴“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”
9449𓀴
9450𓀴“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”
9451𓀴
9452𓀴“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am
9453𓀴afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions
9454𓀴and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
9455𓀴This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”
9456𓀴
9457𓀴“And how?”
9458𓀴
9459𓀴“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
9460𓀴card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down
9461𓀴upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when
9462𓀴all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been
9463𓀴that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,
9464𓀴with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
9465𓀴Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt
9466𓀴quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within
9467𓀴their reach.”
9468𓀴
9469𓀴“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine
9470𓀴indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his
9471𓀴attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of
9472𓀴satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.
9473𓀴
9474𓀴“Ha! you find it so?”
9475𓀴
9476𓀴“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”
9477𓀴
9478𓀴Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he
9479𓀴shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”
9480𓀴
9481𓀴“On the contrary, this is the right side.”
9482𓀴
9483𓀴“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over
9484𓀴here.”
9485𓀴
9486𓀴“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,
9487𓀴which interests me deeply.”
9488𓀴
9489𓀴“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct.
9490𓀴4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.
9491𓀴6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.’ I see nothing in that.”
9492𓀴
9493𓀴“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,
9494𓀴it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate
9495𓀴you again.”
9496𓀴
9497𓀴“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard
9498𓀴work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,
9499𓀴Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter
9500𓀴first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made
9501𓀴for the door.
9502𓀴
9503𓀴“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival
9504𓀴vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.
9505𓀴Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such
9506𓀴person.”
9507𓀴
9508𓀴Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his
9509𓀴forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
9510𓀴
9511𓀴He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his
9512𓀴overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor
9513𓀴work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your
9514𓀴papers for a little.”
9515𓀴
9516𓀴It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no
9517𓀴time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s
9518𓀴man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a
9519𓀴youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great
9520𓀴astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out
9521𓀴upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of
9522𓀴cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of
9523𓀴ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my
9524𓀴two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with
9525𓀴no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
9526𓀴to this address.
9527𓀴
9528𓀴Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.
9529𓀴His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which
9530𓀴made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
9531𓀴
9532𓀴“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.
9533𓀴
9534𓀴“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”
9535𓀴
9536𓀴“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am
9537𓀴surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that
9538𓀴I hear his step now upon the stairs.”
9539𓀴
9540𓀴It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
9541𓀴dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
9542𓀴perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
9543𓀴
9544𓀴“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.
9545𓀴
9546𓀴“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have
9547𓀴you good authority for what you say?”
9548𓀴
9549𓀴“The best possible.”
9550𓀴
9551𓀴Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
9552𓀴
9553𓀴“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the
9554𓀴family has been subjected to such humiliation?”
9555𓀴
9556𓀴“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
9557𓀴humiliation.”
9558𓀴
9559𓀴“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”
9560𓀴
9561𓀴“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady
9562𓀴could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was
9563𓀴undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise
9564𓀴her at such a crisis.”
9565𓀴
9566𓀴“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping
9567𓀴his fingers upon the table.
9568𓀴
9569𓀴“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented
9570𓀴a position.”
9571𓀴
9572𓀴“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been
9573𓀴shamefully used.”
9574𓀴
9575𓀴“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on
9576𓀴the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the
9577𓀴matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
9578𓀴successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
9579𓀴“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.
9580𓀴Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”
9581𓀴
9582𓀴At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and
9583𓀴stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the
9584𓀴breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had
9585𓀴taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he
9586𓀴still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,
9587𓀴perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
9588𓀴
9589𓀴“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause
9590𓀴to be.”
9591𓀴
9592𓀴“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
9593𓀴
9594𓀴“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should
9595𓀴have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from
9596𓀴the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was
9597𓀴doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right
9598𓀴there before the altar.”
9599𓀴
9600𓀴“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the
9601𓀴room while you explain this matter?”
9602𓀴
9603𓀴“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had
9604𓀴just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,
9605𓀴I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was
9606𓀴a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert
9607𓀴manner.
9608𓀴
9609𓀴“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I
9610𓀴met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a
9611𓀴claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day
9612𓀴father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had
9613𓀴a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the
9614𓀴poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting
9615𓀴any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his
9616𓀴hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing
9617𓀴anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
9618𓀴fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his
9619𓀴pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
9620𓀴So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged
9621𓀴myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be
9622𓀴married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;
9623𓀴and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we
9624𓀴talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman
9625𓀴all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank
9626𓀴went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
9627𓀴
9628𓀴“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went
9629𓀴prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After
9630𓀴that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been
9631𓀴attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the
9632𓀴killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa
9633𓀴thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not
9634𓀴a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that
9635𓀴Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came
9636𓀴to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I
9637𓀴felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
9638𓀴in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
9639𓀴
9640𓀴“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my
9641𓀴duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went
9642𓀴to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a
9643𓀴wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just
9644𓀴as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and
9645𓀴looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at
9646𓀴first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of
9647𓀴question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to
9648𓀴see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning
9649𓀴round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee
9650𓀴in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
9651𓀴a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know
9652𓀴what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to
9653𓀴be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that
9654𓀴he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped
9655𓀴my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he
9656𓀴returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when
9657𓀴he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment
9658𓀴that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever
9659𓀴he might direct.
9660𓀴
9661𓀴“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and
9662𓀴had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a
9663𓀴few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to
9664𓀴Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all
9665𓀴those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain
9666𓀴afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank
9667𓀴out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and
9668𓀴then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and
9669𓀴followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.
9670𓀴Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
9671𓀴secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from
9672𓀴her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we
9673𓀴drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my
9674𓀴true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a
9675𓀴prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that
9676𓀴I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,
9677𓀴and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”
9678𓀴
9679𓀴“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and
9680𓀴the church but not where the lady lived.”
9681𓀴
9682𓀴“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for
9683𓀴openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should
9684𓀴like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line
9685𓀴to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to
9686𓀴think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table
9687𓀴and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and
9688𓀴things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and
9689𓀴dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely
9690𓀴that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
9691𓀴gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he
9692𓀴found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and
9693𓀴kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be
9694𓀴putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to
9695𓀴give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came
9696𓀴right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it
9697𓀴all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you
9698𓀴do not think very meanly of me.”
9699𓀴
9700𓀴Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
9701𓀴listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
9702𓀴narrative.
9703𓀴
9704𓀴“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most
9705𓀴intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”
9706𓀴
9707𓀴“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”
9708𓀴
9709𓀴“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand
9710𓀴and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
9711𓀴
9712𓀴“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a
9713𓀴friendly supper.”
9714𓀴
9715𓀴“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship.
9716𓀴“I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can
9717𓀴hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your
9718𓀴permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us
9719𓀴all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
9720𓀴
9721𓀴“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said
9722𓀴Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,
9723𓀴for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
9724𓀴blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our
9725𓀴children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country
9726𓀴under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the
9727𓀴Stars and Stripes.”
9728𓀴
9729𓀴“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our
9730𓀴visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how
9731𓀴simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems
9732𓀴to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the
9733𓀴sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than
9734𓀴the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland
9735𓀴Yard.”
9736𓀴
9737𓀴“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”
9738𓀴
9739𓀴“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
9740𓀴lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
9741𓀴that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
9742𓀴Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
9743𓀴to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
9744𓀴spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of
9745𓀴the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be
9746𓀴someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this
9747𓀴country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an
9748𓀴influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to
9749𓀴change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
9750𓀴process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.
9751𓀴Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much
9752𓀴influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her
9753𓀴young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
9754𓀴strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.
9755𓀴Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in
9756𓀴the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as
9757𓀴the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and
9758𓀴of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’
9759𓀴parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a
9760𓀴prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
9761𓀴gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous
9762𓀴husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”
9763𓀴
9764𓀴“And how in the world did you find them?”
9765𓀴
9766𓀴“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in
9767𓀴his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials
9768𓀴were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was
9769𓀴it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the
9770𓀴most select London hotels.”
9771𓀴
9772𓀴“How did you deduce the select?”
9773𓀴
9774𓀴“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a
9775𓀴glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are
9776𓀴not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I
9777𓀴visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the
9778𓀴book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the
9779𓀴day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon
9780𓀴the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were
9781𓀴to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being
9782𓀴fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give
9783𓀴them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
9784𓀴better in every way that they should make their position a little
9785𓀴clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.
9786𓀴I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the
9787𓀴appointment.”
9788𓀴
9789𓀴“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly
9790𓀴not very gracious.”
9791𓀴
9792𓀴“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very
9793𓀴gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
9794𓀴found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
9795𓀴that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars
9796𓀴that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
9797𓀴your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still
9798𓀴to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”
9799𓀴

9802𓀴
9803𓀴XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
9804𓀴
9805𓀴
9806𓀴“Holmes,” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down
9807𓀴the street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that
9808𓀴his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”
9809𓀴
9810𓀴My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the
9811𓀴pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a
9812𓀴bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still
9813𓀴lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down
9814𓀴the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly
9815𓀴band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of
9816𓀴the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement
9817𓀴had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so
9818𓀴that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction
9819𓀴of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
9820𓀴whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
9821𓀴
9822𓀴He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
9823𓀴massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed
9824𓀴in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
9825𓀴brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were
9826𓀴in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was
9827𓀴running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
9828𓀴who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he
9829𓀴jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face
9830𓀴into the most extraordinary contortions.
9831𓀴
9832𓀴“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up
9833𓀴at the numbers of the houses.”
9834𓀴
9835𓀴“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
9836𓀴
9837𓀴“Here?”
9838𓀴
9839𓀴“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think
9840𓀴that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke,
9841𓀴the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell
9842𓀴until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
9843𓀴
9844𓀴A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
9845𓀴gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his
9846𓀴eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For
9847𓀴a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked
9848𓀴at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his
9849𓀴reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against
9850𓀴the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away
9851𓀴to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the
9852𓀴easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with
9853𓀴him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
9854𓀴
9855𓀴“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You
9856𓀴are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered
9857𓀴yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little
9858𓀴problem which you may submit to me.”
9859𓀴
9860𓀴The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against
9861𓀴his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his
9862𓀴lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
9863𓀴
9864𓀴“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.
9865𓀴
9866𓀴“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.
9867𓀴
9868𓀴“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so
9869𓀴sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,
9870𓀴although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.
9871𓀴Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming
9872𓀴together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very
9873𓀴soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may
9874𓀴suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”
9875𓀴
9876𓀴“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear
9877𓀴account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”
9878𓀴
9879𓀴“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I
9880𓀴am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of
9881𓀴Threadneedle Street.”
9882𓀴
9883𓀴The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner
9884𓀴in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.
9885𓀴What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens
9886𓀴of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until
9887𓀴with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
9888𓀴
9889𓀴“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here
9890𓀴when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
9891𓀴co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried
9892𓀴from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is
9893𓀴why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
9894𓀴exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as
9895𓀴shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
9896𓀴
9897𓀴“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
9898𓀴business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
9899𓀴investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the
9900𓀴number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out
9901𓀴money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We
9902𓀴have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and
9903𓀴there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon
9904𓀴the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
9905𓀴
9906𓀴“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card
9907𓀴was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the
9908𓀴name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I
9909𓀴had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household
9910𓀴word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names
9911𓀴in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he
9912𓀴entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air
9913𓀴of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
9914𓀴
9915𓀴“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit
9916𓀴of advancing money.’
9917𓀴
9918𓀴“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.
9919𓀴
9920𓀴“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £
9921𓀴50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times
9922𓀴over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business
9923𓀴and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily
9924𓀴understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’
9925𓀴
9926𓀴“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.
9927𓀴
9928𓀴“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
9929𓀴certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it
9930𓀴right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should
9931𓀴be paid at once.’
9932𓀴
9933𓀴“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own
9934𓀴private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather
9935𓀴more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the
9936𓀴name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,
9937𓀴even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’
9938𓀴
9939𓀴“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,
9940𓀴black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have
9941𓀴doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’
9942𓀴
9943𓀴“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.
9944𓀴
9945𓀴“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
9946𓀴flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he
9947𓀴had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the
9948𓀴price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would
9949𓀴put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am
9950𓀴prepared to leave it with you as my security.’
9951𓀴
9952𓀴“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity
9953𓀴from it to my illustrious client.
9954𓀴
9955𓀴“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.
9956𓀴
9957𓀴“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’
9958𓀴
9959𓀴“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about
9960𓀴that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain
9961𓀴that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter
9962𓀴of form. Is the security sufficient?’
9963𓀴
9964𓀴“‘Ample.’
9965𓀴
9966𓀴“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of
9967𓀴the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard
9968𓀴of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all
9969𓀴gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with
9970𓀴every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public
9971𓀴scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it
9972𓀴would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no
9973𓀴beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to
9974𓀴replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and
9975𓀴I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’
9976𓀴
9977𓀴“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
9978𓀴calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes.
9979𓀴When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon
9980𓀴the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of
9981𓀴the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no
9982𓀴doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would
9983𓀴ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having
9984𓀴ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
9985𓀴the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
9986𓀴more to my work.
9987𓀴
9988𓀴“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so
9989𓀴precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been
9990𓀴forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible
9991𓀴would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,
9992𓀴therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case
9993𓀴backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of
9994𓀴my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house
9995𓀴at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely
9996𓀴until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my
9997𓀴dressing-room.
9998𓀴
9999𓀴“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
10000𓀴thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of
10001𓀴the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants
10002𓀴who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability
10003𓀴is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,
10004𓀴has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent
10005𓀴character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very
10006𓀴pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about
10007𓀴the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
10008𓀴believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
10009𓀴
10010𓀴“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will
10011𓀴not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,
10012𓀴Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous
10013𓀴disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell
10014𓀴me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died
10015𓀴I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile
10016𓀴fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.
10017𓀴Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,
10018𓀴but I meant it for the best.
10019𓀴
10020𓀴“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
10021𓀴business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,
10022𓀴to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums
10023𓀴of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,
10024𓀴and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a
10025𓀴number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play
10026𓀴heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again
10027𓀴and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
10028𓀴allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than
10029𓀴once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but
10030𓀴each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough
10031𓀴to draw him back again.
10032𓀴
10033𓀴“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell
10034𓀴should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to
10035𓀴my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the
10036𓀴fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world
10037𓀴to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a
10038𓀴brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think
10039𓀴of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am
10040𓀴convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in
10041𓀴his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,
10042𓀴and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight
10043𓀴into character.
10044𓀴
10045𓀴“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when
10046𓀴my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I
10047𓀴adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is
10048𓀴a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and
10049𓀴housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
10050𓀴She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In
10051𓀴only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has
10052𓀴asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she
10053𓀴has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the
10054𓀴right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have
10055𓀴changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!
10056𓀴
10057𓀴“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I
10058𓀴shall continue with my miserable story.
10059𓀴
10060𓀴“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
10061𓀴dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
10062𓀴treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my
10063𓀴client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left
10064𓀴the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur
10065𓀴were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I
10066𓀴thought it better not to disturb it.
10067𓀴
10068𓀴“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.
10069𓀴
10070𓀴“‘In my own bureau.’
10071𓀴
10072𓀴“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the
10073𓀴night.’ said he.
10074𓀴
10075𓀴“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.
10076𓀴
10077𓀴“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have
10078𓀴opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’
10079𓀴
10080𓀴“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what
10081𓀴he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very
10082𓀴grave face.
10083𓀴
10084𓀴“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me
10085𓀴have £ 200?’
10086𓀴
10087𓀴“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with
10088𓀴you in money matters.’
10089𓀴
10090𓀴“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or
10091𓀴else I can never show my face inside the club again.’
10092𓀴
10093𓀴“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.
10094𓀴
10095𓀴“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he.
10096𓀴‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and
10097𓀴if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’
10098𓀴
10099𓀴“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You
10100𓀴shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left
10101𓀴the room without another word.
10102𓀴
10103𓀴“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was
10104𓀴safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see
10105𓀴that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I
10106𓀴thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs
10107𓀴I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and
10108𓀴fastened as I approached.
10109𓀴
10110𓀴“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did
10111𓀴you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’
10112𓀴
10113𓀴“‘Certainly not.’
10114𓀴
10115𓀴“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has
10116𓀴only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is
10117𓀴hardly safe and should be stopped.’
10118𓀴
10119𓀴“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are
10120𓀴you sure that everything is fastened?’
10121𓀴
10122𓀴“‘Quite sure, dad.’
10123𓀴
10124𓀴“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,
10125𓀴where I was soon asleep.
10126𓀴
10127𓀴“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have
10128𓀴any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any
10129𓀴point which I do not make clear.”
10130𓀴
10131𓀴“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”
10132𓀴
10133𓀴“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
10134𓀴particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my
10135𓀴mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in
10136𓀴the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had
10137𓀴ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as
10138𓀴though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all
10139𓀴my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of
10140𓀴footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all
10141𓀴palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room
10142𓀴door.
10143𓀴
10144𓀴“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that
10145𓀴coronet?’
10146𓀴
10147𓀴“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed
10148𓀴only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding
10149𓀴the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending
10150𓀴it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and
10151𓀴turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the
10152𓀴gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
10153𓀴
10154𓀴“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have
10155𓀴destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels
10156𓀴which you have stolen?’
10157𓀴
10158𓀴“‘Stolen!’ he cried.
10159𓀴
10160𓀴“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
10161𓀴
10162𓀴“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.
10163𓀴
10164𓀴“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you
10165𓀴a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another
10166𓀴piece?’
10167𓀴
10168𓀴“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any
10169𓀴longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you
10170𓀴have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and
10171𓀴make my own way in the world.’
10172𓀴
10173𓀴“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with
10174𓀴grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’
10175𓀴
10176𓀴“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I
10177𓀴should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the
10178𓀴police, let the police find what they can.’
10179𓀴
10180𓀴“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in
10181𓀴my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of
10182𓀴the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a
10183𓀴scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the
10184𓀴police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the
10185𓀴inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood
10186𓀴sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to
10187𓀴charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
10188𓀴matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
10189𓀴national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in
10190𓀴everything.
10191𓀴
10192𓀴“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would
10193𓀴be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for
10194𓀴five minutes.’
10195𓀴
10196𓀴“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have
10197𓀴stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I
10198𓀴was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that
10199𓀴of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened
10200𓀴to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it
10201𓀴all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing
10202𓀴stones.
10203𓀴
10204𓀴“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in
10205𓀴the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you
10206𓀴but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the
10207𓀴beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’
10208𓀴
10209𓀴“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning
10210𓀴away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words
10211𓀴of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the
10212𓀴inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only
10213𓀴of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where
10214𓀴he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could
10215𓀴be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our
10216𓀴persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and
10217𓀴I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round
10218𓀴to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The
10219𓀴police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of
10220𓀴it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already
10221𓀴offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my
10222𓀴honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”
10223𓀴
10224𓀴He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,
10225𓀴droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
10226𓀴
10227𓀴Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted
10228𓀴and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
10229𓀴
10230𓀴“Do you receive much company?” he asked.
10231𓀴
10232𓀴“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
10233𓀴Arthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one
10234𓀴else, I think.”
10235𓀴
10236𓀴“Do you go out much in society?”
10237𓀴
10238𓀴“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”
10239𓀴
10240𓀴“That is unusual in a young girl.”
10241𓀴
10242𓀴“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is
10243𓀴four-and-twenty.”
10244𓀴
10245𓀴“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her
10246𓀴also.”
10247𓀴
10248𓀴“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”
10249𓀴
10250𓀴“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”
10251𓀴
10252𓀴“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in
10253𓀴his hands.”
10254𓀴
10255𓀴“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the
10256𓀴coronet at all injured?”
10257𓀴
10258𓀴“Yes, it was twisted.”
10259𓀴
10260𓀴“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten
10261𓀴it?”
10262𓀴
10263𓀴“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it
10264𓀴is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose
10265𓀴were innocent, why did he not say so?”
10266𓀴
10267𓀴“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His
10268𓀴silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular
10269𓀴points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which
10270𓀴awoke you from your sleep?”
10271𓀴
10272𓀴“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his
10273𓀴bedroom door.”
10274𓀴
10275𓀴“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as
10276𓀴to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of
10277𓀴these gems?”
10278𓀴
10279𓀴“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the
10280𓀴hope of finding them.”
10281𓀴
10282𓀴“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”
10283𓀴
10284𓀴“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
10285𓀴already been minutely examined.”
10286𓀴
10287𓀴“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that
10288𓀴this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the
10289𓀴police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a
10290𓀴simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is
10291𓀴involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his
10292𓀴bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,
10293𓀴took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,
10294𓀴went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
10295𓀴thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
10296𓀴returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
10297𓀴himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is
10298𓀴such a theory tenable?”
10299𓀴
10300𓀴“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
10301𓀴“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”
10302𓀴
10303𓀴“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you
10304𓀴please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote
10305𓀴an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”
10306𓀴
10307𓀴My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which
10308𓀴I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply
10309𓀴stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt
10310𓀴of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his
10311𓀴unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I
10312𓀴felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was
10313𓀴dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the
10314𓀴whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his
10315𓀴breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.
10316𓀴Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of
10317𓀴hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
10318𓀴desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
10319𓀴journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence
10320𓀴of the great financier.
10321𓀴
10322𓀴Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a
10323𓀴little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
10324𓀴stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the
10325𓀴entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into
10326𓀴a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the
10327𓀴kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a
10328𓀴lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at
10329𓀴all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us
10330𓀴standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
10331𓀴front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind
10332𓀴into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into
10333𓀴the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were
10334𓀴sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.
10335𓀴She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,
10336𓀴which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do
10337𓀴not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.
10338𓀴Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
10339𓀴As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater
10340𓀴sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
10341𓀴more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,
10342𓀴with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she
10343𓀴went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a
10344𓀴sweet womanly caress.
10345𓀴
10346𓀴“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,
10347𓀴dad?” she asked.
10348𓀴
10349𓀴“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”
10350𓀴
10351𓀴“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts
10352𓀴are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for
10353𓀴having acted so harshly.”
10354𓀴
10355𓀴“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”
10356𓀴
10357𓀴“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect
10358𓀴him.”
10359𓀴
10360𓀴“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the
10361𓀴coronet in his hand?”
10362𓀴
10363𓀴“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my
10364𓀴word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.
10365𓀴It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”
10366𓀴
10367𓀴“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your
10368𓀴affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far
10369𓀴from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London
10370𓀴to inquire more deeply into it.”
10371𓀴
10372𓀴“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.
10373𓀴
10374𓀴“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the
10375𓀴stable lane now.”
10376𓀴
10377𓀴“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to
10378𓀴find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will
10379𓀴succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin
10380𓀴Arthur is innocent of this crime.”
10381𓀴
10382𓀴“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove
10383𓀴it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his
10384𓀴shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.
10385𓀴Might I ask you a question or two?”
10386𓀴
10387𓀴“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”
10388𓀴
10389𓀴“You heard nothing yourself last night?”
10390𓀴
10391𓀴“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and
10392𓀴I came down.”
10393𓀴
10394𓀴“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all
10395𓀴the windows?”
10396𓀴
10397𓀴“Yes.”
10398𓀴
10399𓀴“Were they all fastened this morning?”
10400𓀴
10401𓀴“Yes.”
10402𓀴
10403𓀴“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to
10404𓀴your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”
10405𓀴
10406𓀴“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may
10407𓀴have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”
10408𓀴
10409𓀴“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,
10410𓀴and that the two may have planned the robbery.”
10411𓀴
10412𓀴“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker
10413𓀴impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet
10414𓀴in his hands?”
10415𓀴
10416𓀴“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,
10417𓀴Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”
10418𓀴
10419𓀴“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met
10420𓀴her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”
10421𓀴
10422𓀴“Do you know him?”
10423𓀴
10424𓀴“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His
10425𓀴name is Francis Prosper.”
10426𓀴
10427𓀴“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,
10428𓀴farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”
10429𓀴
10430𓀴“Yes, he did.”
10431𓀴
10432𓀴“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”
10433𓀴
10434𓀴Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black
10435𓀴eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”
10436𓀴She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager
10437𓀴face.
10438𓀴
10439𓀴“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably
10440𓀴wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better
10441𓀴take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”
10442𓀴
10443𓀴He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the
10444𓀴large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he
10445𓀴opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his
10446𓀴powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.
10447𓀴
10448𓀴The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with
10449𓀴a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the
10450𓀴bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
10451𓀴
10452𓀴“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.
10453𓀴
10454𓀴“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the
10455𓀴lumber-room.”
10456𓀴
10457𓀴“Have you it here?”
10458𓀴
10459𓀴“That is it on the dressing-table.”
10460𓀴
10461𓀴Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
10462𓀴
10463𓀴“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not
10464𓀴wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a
10465𓀴look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it
10466𓀴upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,
10467𓀴and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one
10468𓀴side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three
10469𓀴gems had been torn away.
10470𓀴
10471𓀴“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds
10472𓀴to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will
10473𓀴break it off.”
10474𓀴
10475𓀴The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.
10476𓀴
10477𓀴“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without
10478𓀴result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am
10479𓀴exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to
10480𓀴break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would
10481𓀴happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a
10482𓀴pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards
10483𓀴of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”
10484𓀴
10485𓀴“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”
10486𓀴
10487𓀴“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss
10488𓀴Holder?”
10489𓀴
10490𓀴“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”
10491𓀴
10492𓀴“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”
10493𓀴
10494𓀴“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”
10495𓀴
10496𓀴“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck
10497𓀴during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not
10498𓀴succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I
10499𓀴shall now continue my investigations outside.”
10500𓀴
10501𓀴He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
10502𓀴unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour
10503𓀴or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow
10504𓀴and his features as inscrutable as ever.
10505𓀴
10506𓀴“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”
10507𓀴said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”
10508𓀴
10509𓀴“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”
10510𓀴
10511𓀴“I cannot tell.”
10512𓀴
10513𓀴The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.
10514𓀴“And my son? You give me hopes?”
10515𓀴
10516𓀴“My opinion is in no way altered.”
10517𓀴
10518𓀴“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in
10519𓀴my house last night?”
10520𓀴
10521𓀴“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning
10522𓀴between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it
10523𓀴clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,
10524𓀴provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on
10525𓀴the sum I may draw.”
10526𓀴
10527𓀴“I would give my fortune to have them back.”
10528𓀴
10529𓀴“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
10530𓀴Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again
10531𓀴before evening.”
10532𓀴
10533𓀴It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the
10534𓀴case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even
10535𓀴dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured
10536𓀴to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other
10537𓀴topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three
10538𓀴when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his
10539𓀴chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.
10540𓀴With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and
10541𓀴his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
10542𓀴
10543𓀴“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above
10544𓀴the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I
10545𓀴fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may
10546𓀴be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I
10547𓀴hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from
10548𓀴the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of
10549𓀴bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon
10550𓀴his expedition.
10551𓀴
10552𓀴I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent
10553𓀴spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it
10554𓀴down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
10555𓀴
10556𓀴“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”
10557𓀴
10558𓀴“Where to?”
10559𓀴
10560𓀴“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I
10561𓀴get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”
10562𓀴
10563𓀴“How are you getting on?”
10564𓀴
10565𓀴“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since
10566𓀴I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet
10567𓀴little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.
10568𓀴However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable
10569𓀴clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”
10570𓀴
10571𓀴I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
10572𓀴than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even
10573𓀴a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a
10574𓀴few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that
10575𓀴he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
10576𓀴
10577𓀴I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I
10578𓀴retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for
10579𓀴days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his
10580𓀴lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,
10581𓀴but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a
10582𓀴cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim
10583𓀴as possible.
10584𓀴
10585𓀴“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you
10586𓀴remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”
10587𓀴
10588𓀴“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if
10589𓀴that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”
10590𓀴
10591𓀴It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change
10592𓀴which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad
10593𓀴and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed
10594𓀴to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy
10595𓀴which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,
10596𓀴and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for
10597𓀴him.
10598𓀴
10599𓀴“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.
10600𓀴“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in
10601𓀴the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow
10602𓀴comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted
10603𓀴me.”
10604𓀴
10605𓀴“Deserted you?”
10606𓀴
10607𓀴“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,
10608𓀴and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last
10609𓀴night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all
10610𓀴might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say
10611𓀴so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
10612𓀴
10613𓀴    “‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
10614𓀴    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might
10615𓀴    never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever
10616𓀴    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you
10617𓀴    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;
10618𓀴    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless
10619𓀴    labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever
10620𓀴    your loving,
10621𓀴
10622𓀴
10623𓀴    “‘MARY.’
10624𓀴
10625𓀴
10626𓀴“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points
10627𓀴to suicide?”
10628𓀴
10629𓀴“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.
10630𓀴I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”
10631𓀴
10632𓀴“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned
10633𓀴something! Where are the gems?”
10634𓀴
10635𓀴“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”
10636𓀴
10637𓀴“I would pay ten.”
10638𓀴
10639𓀴“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And
10640𓀴there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a
10641𓀴pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”
10642𓀴
10643𓀴With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked
10644𓀴over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three
10645𓀴gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
10646𓀴
10647𓀴With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
10648𓀴
10649𓀴“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”
10650𓀴
10651𓀴The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he
10652𓀴hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
10653𓀴
10654𓀴“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes
10655𓀴rather sternly.
10656𓀴
10657𓀴“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”
10658𓀴
10659𓀴“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble
10660𓀴lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be
10661𓀴proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”
10662𓀴
10663𓀴“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”
10664𓀴
10665𓀴“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”
10666𓀴
10667𓀴“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know
10668𓀴that the truth is known.”
10669𓀴
10670𓀴“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview
10671𓀴with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to
10672𓀴him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very
10673𓀴few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this
10674𓀴morning, however, may open his lips.”
10675𓀴
10676𓀴“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”
10677𓀴
10678𓀴“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And
10679𓀴let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and
10680𓀴for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George
10681𓀴Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”
10682𓀴
10683𓀴“My Mary? Impossible!”
10684𓀴
10685𓀴“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor
10686𓀴your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into
10687𓀴your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a
10688𓀴ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or
10689𓀴conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his
10690𓀴vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered
10691𓀴herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what
10692𓀴he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of
10693𓀴seeing him nearly every evening.”
10694𓀴
10695𓀴“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen
10696𓀴face.
10697𓀴
10698𓀴“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your
10699𓀴niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down
10700𓀴and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable
10701𓀴lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he
10702𓀴stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold
10703𓀴kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that
10704𓀴she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover
10705𓀴extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.
10706𓀴She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
10707𓀴downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about
10708𓀴one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was
10709𓀴all perfectly true.
10710𓀴
10711𓀴“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he
10712𓀴slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the
10713𓀴middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose
10714𓀴and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very
10715𓀴stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your
10716𓀴dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some
10717𓀴clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this
10718𓀴strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the
10719𓀴light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious
10720𓀴coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling
10721𓀴with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,
10722𓀴whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her
10723𓀴stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the
10724𓀴gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing
10725𓀴quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
10726𓀴
10727𓀴“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a
10728𓀴horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she
10729𓀴was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,
10730𓀴and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as
10731𓀴he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,
10732𓀴and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the
10733𓀴moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught
10734𓀴him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one
10735𓀴side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,
10736𓀴your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
10737𓀴suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his
10738𓀴hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had
10739𓀴just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was
10740𓀴endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”
10741𓀴
10742𓀴“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.
10743𓀴
10744𓀴“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he
10745𓀴felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the
10746𓀴true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved
10747𓀴little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous
10748𓀴view, however, and preserved her secret.”
10749𓀴
10750𓀴“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”
10751𓀴cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his
10752𓀴asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted
10753𓀴to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How
10754𓀴cruelly I have misjudged him!”
10755𓀴
10756𓀴“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very
10757𓀴carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow
10758𓀴which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening
10759𓀴before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve
10760𓀴impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all
10761𓀴trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the
10762𓀴far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,
10763𓀴whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I
10764𓀴could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run
10765𓀴back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
10766𓀴marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I
10767𓀴thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of
10768𓀴whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I
10769𓀴passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random
10770𓀴tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
10771𓀴lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of
10772𓀴me.
10773𓀴
10774𓀴“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double
10775𓀴line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was
10776𓀴at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your
10777𓀴son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and
10778𓀴as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it
10779𓀴was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and
10780𓀴found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow
10781𓀴away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
10782𓀴yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where
10783𓀴the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,
10784𓀴where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not
10785𓀴mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge
10786𓀴of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the
10787𓀴high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,
10788𓀴so there was an end to that clue.
10789𓀴
10790𓀴“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill
10791𓀴and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see
10792𓀴that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an
10793𓀴instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then
10794𓀴beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man
10795𓀴had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed
10796𓀴had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled
10797𓀴with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength
10798𓀴causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had
10799𓀴returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his
10800𓀴opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and
10801𓀴who was it brought him the coronet?
10802𓀴
10803𓀴“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
10804𓀴whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew
10805𓀴that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained
10806𓀴your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son
10807𓀴allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible
10808𓀴reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent
10809𓀴explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret
10810𓀴was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that
10811𓀴window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my
10812𓀴conjecture became a certainty.
10813𓀴
10814𓀴“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for
10815𓀴who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to
10816𓀴you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends
10817𓀴was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had
10818𓀴heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It
10819𓀴must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.
10820𓀴Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still
10821𓀴flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word
10822𓀴without compromising his own family.
10823𓀴
10824𓀴“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I
10825𓀴went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up
10826𓀴an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his
10827𓀴head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,
10828𓀴made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I
10829𓀴journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the
10830𓀴tracks.”
10831𓀴
10832𓀴“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.
10833𓀴Holder.
10834𓀴
10835𓀴“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and
10836𓀴changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,
10837𓀴for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I
10838𓀴knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the
10839𓀴matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.
10840𓀴But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to
10841𓀴bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,
10842𓀴however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.
10843𓀴Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
10844𓀴him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the
10845𓀴first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,
10846𓀴‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get
10847𓀴the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there
10848𓀴would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I
10849𓀴got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told
10850𓀴him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,
10851𓀴after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”
10852𓀴
10853𓀴“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the
10854𓀴banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall
10855𓀴not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed
10856𓀴exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy
10857𓀴to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you
10858𓀴tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can
10859𓀴inform me where she is now.”
10860𓀴
10861𓀴“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is
10862𓀴wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
10863𓀴whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
10864𓀴punishment.”
10865𓀴
10866𓀴
10867𓀴
10868𓀴
10869𓀴XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
10870𓀴
10871𓀴
10872𓀴“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,
10873𓀴tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, “it is
10874𓀴frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the
10875𓀴keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,
10876𓀴Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little
10877𓀴records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I
10878𓀴am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence
10879𓀴not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in
10880𓀴which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
10881𓀴trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of
10882𓀴deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special
10883𓀴province.”
10884𓀴
10885𓀴“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from
10886𓀴the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”
10887𓀴
10888𓀴“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with
10889𓀴the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont
10890𓀴to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a
10891𓀴meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and
10892𓀴life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the
10893𓀴task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect
10894𓀴which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”
10895𓀴
10896𓀴“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I
10897𓀴remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I
10898𓀴had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s
10899𓀴singular character.
10900𓀴
10901𓀴“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his
10902𓀴wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my
10903𓀴art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.
10904𓀴Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather
10905𓀴than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what
10906𓀴should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”
10907𓀴
10908𓀴It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast
10909𓀴on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A
10910𓀴thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the
10911𓀴opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy
10912𓀴yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and
10913𓀴glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
10914𓀴Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously
10915𓀴into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
10916𓀴having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet
10917𓀴temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
10918𓀴
10919𓀴“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat
10920𓀴puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly
10921𓀴be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you
10922𓀴have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not
10923𓀴treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I
10924𓀴endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of
10925𓀴Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the
10926𓀴twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters
10927𓀴which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,
10928𓀴I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”
10929𓀴
10930𓀴“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have
10931𓀴been novel and of interest.”
10932𓀴
10933𓀴“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
10934𓀴public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by
10935𓀴his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!
10936𓀴But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of
10937𓀴the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all
10938𓀴enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to
10939𓀴be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and
10940𓀴giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I
10941𓀴have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning
10942𓀴marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter
10943𓀴across to me.
10944𓀴
10945𓀴It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran
10946𓀴thus:
10947𓀴
10948𓀴    “DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I
10949𓀴    should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to
10950𓀴    me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do
10951𓀴    not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
10952𓀴
10953𓀴
10954𓀴    “VIOLET HUNTER.”
10955𓀴
10956𓀴
10957𓀴“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.
10958𓀴
10959𓀴“Not I.”
10960𓀴
10961𓀴“It is half-past ten now.”
10962𓀴
10963𓀴“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”
10964𓀴
10965𓀴“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember
10966𓀴that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim
10967𓀴at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this
10968𓀴case, also.”
10969𓀴
10970𓀴“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for
10971𓀴here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”
10972𓀴
10973𓀴As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was
10974𓀴plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a
10975𓀴plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own
10976𓀴way to make in the world.
10977𓀴
10978𓀴“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my
10979𓀴companion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience,
10980𓀴and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask
10981𓀴advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what
10982𓀴I should do.”
10983𓀴
10984𓀴“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I
10985𓀴can to serve you.”
10986𓀴
10987𓀴I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and
10988𓀴speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,
10989𓀴and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips
10990𓀴together, to listen to her story.
10991𓀴
10992𓀴“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of
10993𓀴Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an
10994𓀴appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to
10995𓀴America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I
10996𓀴advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last
10997𓀴the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my
10998𓀴wit’s end as to what I should do.
10999𓀴
11000𓀴“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called
11001𓀴Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see
11002𓀴whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the
11003𓀴name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss
11004𓀴Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are
11005𓀴seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by
11006𓀴one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything
11007𓀴which would suit them.
11008𓀴
11009𓀴“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as
11010𓀴usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout
11011𓀴man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down
11012𓀴in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of
11013𓀴glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
11014𓀴As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to
11015𓀴Miss Stoper.
11016𓀴
11017𓀴“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better.
11018𓀴Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands
11019𓀴together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking
11020𓀴man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
11021𓀴
11022𓀴“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.
11023𓀴
11024𓀴“‘Yes, sir.’
11025𓀴
11026𓀴“‘As governess?’
11027𓀴
11028𓀴“‘Yes, sir.’
11029𓀴
11030𓀴“‘And what salary do you ask?’
11031𓀴
11032𓀴“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’
11033𓀴
11034𓀴“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat
11035𓀴hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How
11036𓀴could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and
11037𓀴accomplishments?’
11038𓀴
11039𓀴“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A
11040𓀴little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’
11041𓀴
11042𓀴“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The
11043𓀴point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a
11044𓀴lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted
11045𓀴for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in
11046𓀴the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any
11047𓀴gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three
11048𓀴figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’
11049𓀴
11050𓀴“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an
11051𓀴offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing
11052𓀴perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and
11053𓀴took out a note.
11054𓀴
11055𓀴“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion
11056𓀴until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white
11057𓀴creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary
11058𓀴beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey
11059𓀴and their wardrobe.’
11060𓀴
11061𓀴“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful
11062𓀴a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a
11063𓀴great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the
11064𓀴whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I
11065𓀴quite committed myself.
11066𓀴
11067𓀴“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.
11068𓀴
11069𓀴“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on
11070𓀴the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear
11071𓀴young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’
11072𓀴
11073𓀴“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’
11074𓀴
11075𓀴“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could
11076𓀴see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three
11077𓀴gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed
11078𓀴his eyes into his head again.
11079𓀴
11080𓀴“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but
11081𓀴the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
11082𓀴
11083𓀴“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single
11084𓀴child?’
11085𓀴
11086𓀴“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.
11087𓀴‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to
11088𓀴obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they
11089𓀴were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no
11090𓀴difficulty, heh?’
11091𓀴
11092𓀴“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’
11093𓀴
11094𓀴“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
11095𓀴know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which
11096𓀴we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’
11097𓀴
11098𓀴“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.
11099𓀴
11100𓀴“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’
11101𓀴
11102𓀴“‘Oh, no.’
11103𓀴
11104𓀴“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’
11105𓀴
11106𓀴“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my
11107𓀴hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
11108𓀴It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in
11109𓀴this offhand fashion.
11110𓀴
11111𓀴“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been
11112𓀴watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow
11113𓀴pass over his face as I spoke.
11114𓀴
11115𓀴“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little
11116𓀴fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’
11117𓀴fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’
11118𓀴
11119𓀴“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.
11120𓀴
11121𓀴“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,
11122𓀴because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In
11123𓀴that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young
11124𓀴ladies.’
11125𓀴
11126𓀴“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a
11127𓀴word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance
11128𓀴upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a
11129𓀴handsome commission through my refusal.
11130𓀴
11131𓀴“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.
11132𓀴
11133𓀴“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’
11134𓀴
11135𓀴“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most
11136𓀴excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly
11137𓀴expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.
11138𓀴Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I
11139𓀴was shown out by the page.
11140𓀴
11141𓀴“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little
11142𓀴enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began
11143𓀴to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,
11144𓀴if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most
11145𓀴extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their
11146𓀴eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year.
11147𓀴Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by
11148𓀴wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I
11149𓀴was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I
11150𓀴was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to
11151𓀴the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received
11152𓀴this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read
11153𓀴it to you:
11154𓀴
11155𓀴“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
11156𓀴
11157𓀴    “‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
11158𓀴    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
11159𓀴    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should
11160𓀴    come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We
11161𓀴    are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to
11162𓀴    recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may
11163𓀴    cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond
11164𓀴    of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear
11165𓀴    such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to
11166𓀴    the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear
11167𓀴    daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,
11168𓀴    fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing
11169𓀴    yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no
11170𓀴    inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,
11171𓀴    especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our
11172𓀴    short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this
11173𓀴    point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you
11174𓀴    for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are
11175𓀴    very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the
11176𓀴    dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
11177𓀴
11178𓀴
11179𓀴    “‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’
11180𓀴
11181𓀴
11182𓀴“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind
11183𓀴is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before
11184𓀴taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your
11185𓀴consideration.”
11186𓀴
11187𓀴“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
11188𓀴question,” said Holmes, smiling.
11189𓀴
11190𓀴“But you would not advise me to refuse?”
11191𓀴
11192𓀴“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a
11193𓀴sister of mine apply for.”
11194𓀴
11195𓀴“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”
11196𓀴
11197𓀴“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed
11198𓀴some opinion?”
11199𓀴
11200𓀴“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle
11201𓀴seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his
11202𓀴wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear
11203𓀴she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in
11204𓀴every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”
11205𓀴
11206𓀴“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most
11207𓀴probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household
11208𓀴for a young lady.”
11209𓀴
11210𓀴“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”
11211𓀴
11212𓀴“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me
11213𓀴uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have
11214𓀴their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”
11215𓀴
11216𓀴“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand
11217𓀴afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I
11218𓀴felt that you were at the back of me.”
11219𓀴
11220𓀴“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your
11221𓀴little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my
11222𓀴way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of
11223𓀴the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”
11224𓀴
11225𓀴“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”
11226𓀴
11227𓀴Holmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we
11228𓀴could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram
11229𓀴would bring me down to your help.”
11230𓀴
11231𓀴“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all
11232𓀴swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my
11233𓀴mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair
11234𓀴to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful
11235𓀴words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her
11236𓀴way.
11237𓀴
11238𓀴“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the
11239𓀴stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take
11240𓀴care of herself.”
11241𓀴
11242𓀴“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if
11243𓀴we do not hear from her before many days are past.”
11244𓀴
11245𓀴It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A
11246𓀴fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning
11247𓀴in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human
11248𓀴experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the
11249𓀴curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something
11250𓀴abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a
11251𓀴philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to
11252𓀴determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an
11253𓀴hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the
11254𓀴matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!
11255𓀴data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And
11256𓀴yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should
11257𓀴ever have accepted such a situation.
11258𓀴
11259𓀴The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I
11260𓀴was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those
11261𓀴all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I
11262𓀴would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and
11263𓀴find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the
11264𓀴morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the
11265𓀴message, threw it across to me.
11266𓀴
11267𓀴“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his
11268𓀴chemical studies.
11269𓀴
11270𓀴The summons was a brief and urgent one.
11271𓀴
11272𓀴“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,”
11273𓀴it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.
11274𓀴
11275𓀴
11276𓀴“HUNTER.”
11277𓀴
11278𓀴
11279𓀴“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.
11280𓀴
11281𓀴“I should wish to.”
11282𓀴
11283𓀴“Just look it up, then.”
11284𓀴
11285𓀴“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my
11286𓀴Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”
11287𓀴
11288𓀴“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
11289𓀴analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
11290𓀴morning.”
11291𓀴
11292𓀴By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old
11293𓀴English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the
11294𓀴way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them
11295𓀴down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a
11296𓀴light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across
11297𓀴from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was
11298𓀴an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.
11299𓀴All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,
11300𓀴the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from
11301𓀴amid the light green of the new foliage.
11302𓀴
11303𓀴“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of
11304𓀴a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
11305𓀴
11306𓀴But Holmes shook his head gravely.
11307𓀴
11308𓀴“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind
11309𓀴with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to
11310𓀴my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are
11311𓀴impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which
11312𓀴comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with
11313𓀴which crime may be committed there.”
11314𓀴
11315𓀴“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old
11316𓀴homesteads?”
11317𓀴
11318𓀴“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,
11319𓀴founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London
11320𓀴do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and
11321𓀴beautiful countryside.”
11322𓀴
11323𓀴“You horrify me!”
11324𓀴
11325𓀴“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do
11326𓀴in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile
11327𓀴that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow,
11328𓀴does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then
11329𓀴the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of
11330𓀴complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime
11331𓀴and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,
11332𓀴filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the
11333𓀴law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which
11334𓀴may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had
11335𓀴this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
11336𓀴should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country
11337𓀴which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally
11338𓀴threatened.”
11339𓀴
11340𓀴“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”
11341𓀴
11342𓀴“Quite so. She has her freedom.”
11343𓀴
11344𓀴“What _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”
11345𓀴
11346𓀴“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover
11347𓀴the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can
11348𓀴only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt
11349𓀴find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we
11350𓀴shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”
11351𓀴
11352𓀴The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance
11353𓀴from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She
11354𓀴had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
11355𓀴
11356𓀴“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so
11357𓀴very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your
11358𓀴advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”
11359𓀴
11360𓀴“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”
11361𓀴
11362𓀴“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to
11363𓀴be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,
11364𓀴though he little knew for what purpose.”
11365𓀴
11366𓀴“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin
11367𓀴legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
11368𓀴
11369𓀴“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no
11370𓀴actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to
11371𓀴them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my
11372𓀴mind about them.”
11373𓀴
11374𓀴“What can you not understand?”
11375𓀴
11376𓀴“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it
11377𓀴occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in
11378𓀴his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully
11379𓀴situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square
11380𓀴block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp
11381𓀴and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and
11382𓀴on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road,
11383𓀴which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This
11384𓀴ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part
11385𓀴of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately
11386𓀴in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
11387𓀴
11388𓀴“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was
11389𓀴introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no
11390𓀴truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable
11391𓀴in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to
11392𓀴be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more
11393𓀴than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than
11394𓀴forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been
11395𓀴married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only
11396𓀴child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.
11397𓀴Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
11398𓀴was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the
11399𓀴daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that
11400𓀴her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.
11401𓀴
11402𓀴“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in
11403𓀴feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a
11404𓀴nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to
11405𓀴her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered
11406𓀴continually from one to the other, noting every little want and
11407𓀴forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,
11408𓀴boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.
11409𓀴And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost
11410𓀴in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I
11411𓀴have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the
11412𓀴disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never
11413𓀴met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is
11414𓀴small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
11415𓀴His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage
11416𓀴fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any
11417𓀴creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and
11418𓀴he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,
11419𓀴little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the
11420𓀴creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”
11421𓀴
11422𓀴“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to
11423𓀴you to be relevant or not.”
11424𓀴
11425𓀴“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant
11426𓀴thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and
11427𓀴conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.
11428𓀴Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled
11429𓀴hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have
11430𓀴been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to
11431𓀴take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a
11432𓀴sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a
11433𓀴most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
11434𓀴nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of
11435𓀴the building.
11436𓀴
11437𓀴“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very
11438𓀴quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and
11439𓀴whispered something to her husband.
11440𓀴
11441𓀴“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you,
11442𓀴Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.
11443𓀴I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your
11444𓀴appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become
11445𓀴you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you
11446𓀴would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’
11447𓀴
11448𓀴“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of
11449𓀴blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore
11450𓀴unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a
11451𓀴better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
11452𓀴expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated
11453𓀴in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which
11454𓀴is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,
11455𓀴with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been
11456𓀴placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In
11457𓀴this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on
11458𓀴the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
11459𓀴stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he
11460𓀴was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who
11461𓀴has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with
11462𓀴her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an
11463𓀴hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence
11464𓀴the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to
11465𓀴little Edward in the nursery.
11466𓀴
11467𓀴“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly
11468𓀴similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the
11469𓀴window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which
11470𓀴my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.
11471𓀴Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little
11472𓀴sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me
11473𓀴to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the
11474𓀴heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he
11475𓀴ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
11476𓀴
11477𓀴“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what
11478𓀴the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They
11479𓀴were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the
11480𓀴window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going
11481𓀴on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon
11482𓀴devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought
11483𓀴seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On
11484𓀴the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief
11485𓀴up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that
11486𓀴there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was
11487𓀴nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,
11488𓀴however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton
11489𓀴Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
11490𓀴my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually
11491𓀴people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which
11492𓀴bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my
11493𓀴handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon
11494𓀴me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced
11495𓀴that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what
11496𓀴was behind me. She rose at once.
11497𓀴
11498𓀴“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road
11499𓀴there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’
11500𓀴
11501𓀴“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.
11502𓀴
11503𓀴“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’
11504𓀴
11505𓀴“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to
11506𓀴go away.’
11507𓀴
11508𓀴“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’
11509𓀴
11510𓀴“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round
11511𓀴and wave him away like that.’
11512𓀴
11513𓀴“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down
11514𓀴the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again
11515𓀴in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the
11516𓀴road.”
11517𓀴
11518𓀴“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most
11519𓀴interesting one.”
11520𓀴
11521𓀴“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to
11522𓀴be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On
11523𓀴the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took
11524𓀴me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we
11525𓀴approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as
11526𓀴of a large animal moving about.
11527𓀴
11528𓀴“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
11529𓀴planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’
11530𓀴
11531𓀴“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague
11532𓀴figure huddled up in the darkness.
11533𓀴
11534𓀴“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I
11535𓀴had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really
11536𓀴old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We
11537𓀴feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as
11538𓀴keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the
11539𓀴trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you
11540𓀴ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s
11541𓀴as much as your life is worth.’
11542𓀴
11543𓀴“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look
11544𓀴out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a
11545𓀴beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was
11546𓀴silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the
11547𓀴peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was
11548𓀴moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the
11549𓀴moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,
11550𓀴tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting
11551𓀴bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow
11552𓀴upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
11553𓀴which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
11554𓀴
11555𓀴“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you
11556𓀴know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at
11557𓀴the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I
11558𓀴began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by
11559𓀴rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in
11560𓀴the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I
11561𓀴had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack
11562𓀴away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
11563𓀴It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I
11564𓀴took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key
11565𓀴fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one
11566𓀴thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It
11567𓀴was my coil of hair.
11568𓀴
11569𓀴“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and
11570𓀴the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded
11571𓀴itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With
11572𓀴trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew
11573𓀴from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I
11574𓀴assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle
11575𓀴as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned
11576𓀴the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the
11577𓀴Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a
11578𓀴drawer which they had locked.
11579𓀴
11580𓀴“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I
11581𓀴soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was
11582𓀴one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door
11583𓀴which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into
11584𓀴this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I
11585𓀴ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,
11586𓀴his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very
11587𓀴different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His
11588𓀴cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins
11589𓀴stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried
11590𓀴past me without a word or a look.
11591𓀴
11592𓀴“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
11593𓀴grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could
11594𓀴see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a
11595𓀴row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered
11596𓀴up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,
11597𓀴glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as
11598𓀴merry and jovial as ever.
11599𓀴
11600𓀴“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a
11601𓀴word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’
11602𓀴
11603𓀴“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem
11604𓀴to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the
11605𓀴shutters up.’
11606𓀴
11607𓀴“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my
11608𓀴remark.
11609𓀴
11610𓀴“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room
11611𓀴up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.
11612𓀴Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke
11613𓀴in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at
11614𓀴me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
11615𓀴
11616𓀴“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was
11617𓀴something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all
11618𓀴on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my
11619𓀴share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good
11620𓀴might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s
11621𓀴instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.
11622𓀴At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any
11623𓀴chance to pass the forbidden door.
11624𓀴
11625𓀴“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
11626𓀴besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in
11627𓀴these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen
11628𓀴bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and
11629𓀴yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was
11630𓀴the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.
11631𓀴Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with
11632𓀴them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently
11633𓀴in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
11634𓀴
11635𓀴“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,
11636𓀴which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner
11637𓀴were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.
11638𓀴They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows
11639𓀴in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening
11640𓀴light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and
11641𓀴across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an
11642𓀴iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at
11643𓀴the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the
11644𓀴key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
11645𓀴shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
11646𓀴beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a
11647𓀴skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage
11648𓀴gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I
11649𓀴suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass
11650𓀴backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone
11651𓀴out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the
11652𓀴sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I
11653𓀴turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me
11654𓀴clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through
11655𓀴the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
11656𓀴outside.
11657𓀴
11658𓀴“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be
11659𓀴when I saw the door open.’
11660𓀴
11661𓀴“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.
11662𓀴
11663𓀴“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how
11664𓀴caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my
11665𓀴dear young lady?’
11666𓀴
11667𓀴“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was
11668𓀴keenly on my guard against him.
11669𓀴
11670𓀴“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it
11671𓀴is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran
11672𓀴out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’
11673𓀴
11674𓀴“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.
11675𓀴
11676𓀴“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.
11677𓀴
11678𓀴“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’
11679𓀴
11680𓀴“‘I am sure that I do not know.’
11681𓀴
11682𓀴“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He
11683𓀴was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
11684𓀴
11685𓀴“‘I am sure if I had known—’
11686𓀴
11687𓀴“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that
11688𓀴threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of
11689𓀴rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you
11690𓀴to the mastiff.’
11691𓀴
11692𓀴“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I
11693𓀴must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I
11694𓀴found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,
11695𓀴Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was
11696𓀴frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,
11697𓀴even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring
11698𓀴you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,
11699𓀴but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon
11700𓀴made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down
11701𓀴to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
11702𓀴returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind
11703𓀴as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered
11704𓀴that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that
11705𓀴evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had
11706𓀴any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him
11707𓀴free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at
11708𓀴the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come
11709𓀴into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,
11710𓀴for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all
11711𓀴the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
11712𓀴all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could
11713𓀴tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”
11714𓀴
11715𓀴Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My
11716𓀴friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his
11717𓀴pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
11718𓀴
11719𓀴“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.
11720𓀴
11721𓀴“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing
11722𓀴with him.”
11723𓀴
11724𓀴“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”
11725𓀴
11726𓀴“Yes.”
11727𓀴
11728𓀴“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”
11729𓀴
11730𓀴“Yes, the wine-cellar.”
11731𓀴
11732𓀴“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave
11733𓀴and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one
11734𓀴more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite
11735𓀴exceptional woman.”
11736𓀴
11737𓀴“I will try. What is it?”
11738𓀴
11739𓀴“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.
11740𓀴The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be
11741𓀴incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If
11742𓀴you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the
11743𓀴key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”
11744𓀴
11745𓀴“I will do it.”
11746𓀴
11747𓀴“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course
11748𓀴there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to
11749𓀴personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
11750𓀴That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is
11751𓀴the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to
11752𓀴have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in
11753𓀴height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,
11754𓀴very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
11755𓀴course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came
11756𓀴upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of
11757𓀴hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress
11758𓀴and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he
11759𓀴saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was
11760𓀴perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog
11761𓀴is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate
11762𓀴with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case
11763𓀴is the disposition of the child.”
11764𓀴
11765𓀴“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.
11766𓀴
11767𓀴“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as
11768𓀴to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see
11769𓀴that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first
11770𓀴real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.
11771𓀴This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s
11772𓀴sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should
11773𓀴suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in
11774𓀴their power.”
11775𓀴
11776𓀴“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A
11777𓀴thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit
11778𓀴it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
11779𓀴creature.”
11780𓀴
11781𓀴“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We
11782𓀴can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,
11783𓀴and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”
11784𓀴
11785𓀴We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the
11786𓀴Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The
11787𓀴group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in
11788𓀴the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even
11789𓀴had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
11790𓀴
11791𓀴“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.
11792𓀴
11793𓀴A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.
11794𓀴Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the
11795𓀴kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.
11796𓀴Rucastle’s.”
11797𓀴
11798𓀴“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead
11799𓀴the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”
11800𓀴
11801𓀴We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,
11802𓀴and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had
11803𓀴described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he
11804𓀴tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came
11805𓀴from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.
11806𓀴
11807𓀴“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,
11808𓀴that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to
11809𓀴it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”
11810𓀴
11811𓀴It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.
11812𓀴Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture
11813𓀴save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The
11814𓀴skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
11815𓀴
11816𓀴“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has
11817𓀴guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”
11818𓀴
11819𓀴“But how?”
11820𓀴
11821𓀴“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung
11822𓀴himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a
11823𓀴long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”
11824𓀴
11825𓀴“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there
11826𓀴when the Rucastles went away.”
11827𓀴
11828𓀴“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
11829𓀴dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he
11830𓀴whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be
11831𓀴as well for you to have your pistol ready.”
11832𓀴
11833𓀴The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the
11834𓀴door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his
11835𓀴hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of
11836𓀴him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
11837𓀴
11838𓀴“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”
11839𓀴
11840𓀴The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
11841𓀴
11842𓀴“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and
11843𓀴thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve
11844𓀴you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
11845𓀴
11846𓀴“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.
11847𓀴
11848𓀴“I have my revolver,” said I.
11849𓀴
11850𓀴“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the
11851𓀴stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the
11852𓀴baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying
11853𓀴sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red
11854𓀴face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
11855𓀴
11856𓀴“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for
11857𓀴two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”
11858𓀴
11859𓀴Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller
11860𓀴hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle
11861𓀴buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the
11862𓀴ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its
11863𓀴keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With
11864𓀴much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly
11865𓀴mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and
11866𓀴having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I
11867𓀴did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him
11868𓀴when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
11869𓀴
11870𓀴“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.
11871𓀴
11872𓀴“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up
11873𓀴to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were
11874𓀴planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”
11875𓀴
11876𓀴“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller
11877𓀴knows more about this matter than anyone else.”
11878𓀴
11879𓀴“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”
11880𓀴
11881𓀴“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points
11882𓀴on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”
11883𓀴
11884𓀴“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so
11885𓀴before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s
11886𓀴police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one
11887𓀴that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.
11888𓀴
11889𓀴“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her
11890𓀴father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,
11891𓀴but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler
11892𓀴at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of
11893𓀴her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she
11894𓀴never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s
11895𓀴hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a
11896𓀴husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give
11897𓀴him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her
11898𓀴to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her
11899𓀴money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got
11900𓀴brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better
11901𓀴at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but
11902𓀴that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as
11903𓀴true as man could be.”
11904𓀴
11905𓀴“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell
11906𓀴us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that
11907𓀴remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of
11908𓀴imprisonment?”
11909𓀴
11910𓀴“Yes, sir.”
11911𓀴
11912𓀴“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the
11913𓀴disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”
11914𓀴
11915𓀴“That was it, sir.”
11916𓀴
11917𓀴“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,
11918𓀴blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,
11919𓀴metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the
11920𓀴same as his.”
11921𓀴
11922𓀴“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.
11923𓀴Toller serenely.
11924𓀴
11925𓀴“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of
11926𓀴drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master
11927𓀴had gone out.”
11928𓀴
11929𓀴“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”
11930𓀴
11931𓀴“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you
11932𓀴have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes
11933𓀴the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had
11934𓀴best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our
11935𓀴_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”
11936𓀴
11937𓀴And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper
11938𓀴beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a
11939𓀴broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
11940𓀴They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of
11941𓀴Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.
11942𓀴Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in
11943𓀴Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a
11944𓀴government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet
11945𓀴Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no
11946𓀴further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
11947𓀴one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
11948𓀴Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

12014𓀴even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

12025𓀴United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
12026𓀴claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
12027𓀴displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
12028𓀴all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
12029𓀴that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
12030𓀴free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™

12035𓀴you share it without charge with others.
12036𓀴
12037𓀴1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
12038𓀴what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
12039𓀴in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
12040𓀴check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this

12101𓀴of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain

12103𓀴full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
12104𓀴

12113𓀴    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
12114𓀴        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
12115𓀴        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
12116𓀴        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
12117𓀴        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
12118𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
12119𓀴        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
12120𓀴        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

12123𓀴        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
12124𓀴        Literary Archive Foundation.”
12125𓀴
12126𓀴    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

12128𓀴        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
12129𓀴        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

12131𓀴        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
12132𓀴        works.
12133𓀴
12134𓀴    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
12135𓀴        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
12136𓀴        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

12150𓀴1.F.
12151𓀴
12152𓀴1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
12153𓀴effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
12154𓀴works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
12155𓀴Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
12156𓀴electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
12157𓀴contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
12158𓀴or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
12159𓀴intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

12167𓀴Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
12168𓀴liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
12169𓀴fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
12170𓀴LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
12171𓀴PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
12172𓀴TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
12173𓀴LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
12174𓀴INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
12175𓀴DAMAGE.
12176𓀴
12177𓀴1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
12178𓀴defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
12179𓀴receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
12180𓀴written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
12181𓀴received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
12182𓀴with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
12183𓀴with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
12184𓀴lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
12185𓀴or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
12186𓀴opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
12187𓀴the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
12188𓀴without further opportunities to fix the problem.
12189𓀴

12195𓀴1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
12196𓀴warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
12197𓀴damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
12198𓀴violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

12216𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
12217𓀴
12218𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
12219𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
12220𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
12221𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
12222𓀴from people in all walks of life.
12223𓀴
12224𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
12225𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
12226𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
12227𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
12228𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
12229𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
12230𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
12231𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
12232𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

12237𓀴501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
12238𓀴state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

12249𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
12250𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
12251𓀴
12252𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
12253𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
12254𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
12255𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
12256𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
12257𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
12258𓀴status with the IRS.
12259𓀴
12260𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
12261𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
12262𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
12263𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
12264𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
12265𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
12266𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
12267𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
12268𓀴
12269𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
12270𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
12271𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
12272𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
12273𓀴
12274𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
12275𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
12276𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
12277𓀴
12278𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
12279𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
12280𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
12281𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

12283𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
12284𓀴
12285𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
12286𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
12287𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
12288𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
12289𓀴volunteer support.
12290𓀴
12291𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
12292𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
12293𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
12294𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
12295𓀴edition.
12296𓀴
12297𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
12298𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.

12300𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
12301𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
12302𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
