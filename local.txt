54𓀴PREFACE
55𓀴
56𓀴By the waves of thought, these "Shells" were washed out upon the
57𓀴shores of imagination, and I gathered them in idle moments.
58𓀴If they shall give you a few hours enjoyment, it will add to the
59𓀴pleasure I experienced in making the collection.

192𓀴_OUR LIVES_
193𓀴
194𓀴Our lives are songs.  God writes the words,
195𓀴  And we set them to music at pleasure;
196𓀴And the song grows glad, or sweet, or sad,
197𓀴  As we choose to fashion the measure.
198𓀴
199𓀴We must write the music, whatever the song,
200𓀴  Whatever its rhyme, or metre;
201𓀴And if it is sad, we can make it glad.
202𓀴  Or if sweet, we can make it sweeter.
203𓀴
204𓀴One has a song that is free and strong;
205𓀴  But the music he writes is minor;
206𓀴And the sad, sad strain is replete with pain,
207𓀴  And the singer becomes a repiner.
208𓀴
209𓀴And he thinks God gave him a dirge-like lay.
210𓀴  Nor knows that the words are cheery;
211𓀴And the song seems lonely and solemn--only
212𓀴  Because the music is dreary.
213𓀴
214𓀴And the song of another has through the words
215𓀴  An under current of sadness;
216𓀴But he sets it to music of ringing chords,
217𓀴  And makes it a pean of gladness.
218𓀴
219𓀴So, whether our songs are sad or not,
220𓀴  We can give the world more pleasure.
221𓀴And better ourselves, by setting the words
222𓀴  To a glad, triumphant measure.

225𓀴_THE MESSENGER_
226𓀴
227𓀴She rose up, in the early dawn,
228𓀴  And white, and silently she moved
229𓀴About the house:  Four men had gone
230𓀴  To battle for the land they loved:
231𓀴And she, the mother, and the wife.
232𓀴Waited for tidings from the strife.
233𓀴How still the house seemed; and her tread
234𓀴Sounded like footsteps of the dead.
235𓀴
236𓀴The long day passed.  The dark night came.
237𓀴  She had not seen a human face.
238𓀴Some voice spoke suddenly her name.
239𓀴  How loud it sounded in that place
240𓀴Where, day on day, no sound was heard
241𓀴But her own footsteps.  "Bring you word,"
242𓀴She cried, to whom she could not see--
243𓀴"Word from the battle plain to me?"
244𓀴A soldier entered at the door,
245𓀴And stood within the dim firelight.
246𓀴
247𓀴"I bring you tidings of the four,"
248𓀴  He said, "Who left you for the fight."
249𓀴"God bless you friend!" she cried, "speak on!"
250𓀴For I can bear it.  "One is gone?"
251𓀴"Ay! one is gone!" he said, "Which one?"
252𓀴"Dear lady--he, your eldest son."
253𓀴
254𓀴A deathly pallor shot across
255𓀴  Her withered face: she did not weep.
256𓀴She said, "It is a grievous loss,
257𓀴  But God gives his beloved sleep.
258𓀴What of the living--of the three,
259𓀴And when can they come back to me?"
260𓀴The soldier turned away his head,
261𓀴"Lady, your husband too, is dead."
262𓀴
263𓀴She put her hand upon her brow.
264𓀴  A wild, sharp pain, was in her eyes,
265𓀴"My husband? oh God help me now."
266𓀴  The soldier shivered at her sighs.
267𓀴The task was harder than he thought.
268𓀴"Your youngest son, dear madam, fought
269𓀴Close at his father's side: both fell
270𓀴Dead, by the bursting of a shell."
271𓀴
272𓀴She moved her lips and seemed to moan.
273𓀴  Her face had paled to ashen grey--
274𓀴"Then one is left me--one alone,"
275𓀴  She said, "of four who marched away.
276𓀴Oh, Over-ruling, All-wise God,
277𓀴How can I pass beneath Thy rod!"
278𓀴The soldier walked across the floor.
279𓀴Paused at the window, at the door--
280𓀴
281𓀴Wiped the cold dew drops from his cheek
282𓀴  And sought the mourner's side again.
283𓀴"Once more, dear lady, I must speak.
284𓀴  Your last remaining son was slain
285𓀴Just at the closing of the fight,
286𓀴'Twas he who sent me here to-night."
287𓀴"God knows," the man said afterward,
288𓀴"The fight itself, was not as hard."
289𓀴
290𓀴1871.
291𓀴
292𓀴
293𓀴_IDLE_
294𓀴
295𓀴I sit in the twilight dim,
296𓀴  At the close of an idle day,
297𓀴And list to the sweet, soft hymn
298𓀴  That rises far away
299𓀴    And dies on the evening air.
300𓀴  Oh, all day long they sing their song
301𓀴    Who toil in the valley there.
302𓀴
303𓀴But never a song sing I,
304𓀴  Sitting with folded hands.
305𓀴The hours pass me by,
306𓀴  Dropping their golden sands.
307𓀴    And I list from day to day
308𓀴  To the tick, tick, tock, of the old brown clock
309𓀴    Ticking my life away.
310𓀴
311𓀴And I see the sunlight fade,
312𓀴  And I see the night come on;
313𓀴And then, in the gloom and shade,
314𓀴  I weep for the day that is gone.
315𓀴    Weep, and wail, in pain,
316𓀴  For the misspent day that has flown away
317𓀴    And will not come again.
318𓀴
319𓀴Another morning beams,
320𓀴  But I forget the last,
321𓀴And sit in my idle dreams
322𓀴  Till the day is overpast.
323𓀴    Oh, the toiler's heart is glad
324𓀴  When the day is gone and the night comes on,
325𓀴    But mine is sore, and sad.
326𓀴
327𓀴For I dare not look behind:
328𓀴  No shining, golden sheaves
329𓀴Can I ever hope to find--
330𓀴  Nothing but withered leaves.
331𓀴    Ah! dreams are very sweet!
332𓀴  But will it please if only these
333𓀴    I lay at the Master's feet.
334𓀴
335𓀴And what will the Master say,
336𓀴  To dreams and nothing more?
337𓀴Oh, idler all the day!
338𓀴  Think, ere thy life is o'er!
339𓀴    And when the day grows late.
340𓀴  Oh, soul of sin, will He let you in
341𓀴    There at the pearly gate?
342𓀴
343𓀴Oh, idle heart beware!
344𓀴  On, to the field of strife!
345𓀴On to the valley there,
346𓀴  And live a useful life.
347𓀴    Up! do not wait a day,
348𓀴  For the old brown clock, with its tick, tick, tock,
349𓀴    Is ticking your life away.
350𓀴
351𓀴1869.
352𓀴
353𓀴
354𓀴_YE AGENTS_
355𓀴
356𓀴These agent men! these agent men!
357𓀴We hear the dreaded step again,
358𓀴We see a stranger at the door;
359𓀴And brace ourselves for war once more.
360𓀴He bows and smiles. "Walk in," we say.
361𓀴
362𓀴He smiles again. "I come to-day.
363𓀴Dear Madam, with a great invention;
364𓀴And Sir, pray give me _your_ attention;
365𓀴Now here, you see, is something new.
366𓀴And just the thing, my friends, for you."
367𓀴
368𓀴In vain we interrupt and say:
369𓀴"We shall not buy of you to-day."
370𓀴"But, Madam, Sir, you have not seen
371𓀴The beauties of this new machine;
372𓀴When thus arranged, your old affair,
373𓀴'Tis plain to see, is just nowhere."
374𓀴"No doubt," I say; "'Tis very fine,
375𓀴And quite superior to mine."
376𓀴This gives him courage. On he goes,
377𓀴And every sentence glibly flows,
378𓀴Until his lesson is repeated
379𓀴To "warranted if fitly treated."
380𓀴
381𓀴"Yes, new and fine, and grand," we say,
382𓀴"But still, we shall not buy to-day."
383𓀴"But, Madam, Sir, pray list to reason,
384𓀴'Twill buy itself in half a season;
385𓀴You see the thing is bound to go."
386𓀴"Oh, certainly, we see, we know.
387𓀴But still, we do not wish to buy."
388𓀴He turns and leaves as with a sigh.
389𓀴And while we hasten to our labor
390𓀴He goes and persecutes our neighbor.
391𓀴
392𓀴But lo! another follows on,
393𓀴Before the last is fairly gone.
394𓀴One day a reaper, next a mower,
395𓀴And then a fanning mill, and sower;
396𓀴Machines of all kinds 'neath the sun,
397𓀴Each better than the other one;
398𓀴A rocker for each dining chair,
399𓀴A brace to hold the broom in air,
400𓀴A book, just out, and you must buy
401𓀴Or give a proper reason why.
402𓀴
403𓀴So, if we sometimes turn away
404𓀴Abruptly, Sirs, you must remember,
405𓀴That we have heard your tale each day
406𓀴From early Spring to late December.
407𓀴Why! if we listened to you all,
408𓀴And gave you the required attention,
409𓀴I think ere long each one would call,
410𓀴The "county house," the _best_ invention.

413𓀴
414𓀴
415𓀴_WARNED_
416𓀴
417𓀴They stood at the garden gate.
418𓀴  By the lifting of a lid
419𓀴She might have read her fate
420𓀴  In a little thing he did.
421𓀴
422𓀴He plucked a beautiful flower,
423𓀴  Tore it away from its place
424𓀴On the side of the blooming bower,
425𓀴  And held it against his face.
426𓀴
427𓀴Drank in its beauty and bloom,
428𓀴  In the midst of his idle talk;
429𓀴Then cast it down to the gloom
430𓀴  And dust of the garden walk.
431𓀴
432𓀴Ay, trod it under his foot,
433𓀴  As it lay in his pathway there;
434𓀴Then spurned it away with his boot,
435𓀴  Because it had ceased to be fair.
436𓀴
437𓀴Ah! the maiden might have read
438𓀴  The doom of her young life then;
439𓀴But she looked in his eyes instead,
440𓀴  And thought him the king of men.
441𓀴
442𓀴She looked in his eyes and blushed,
443𓀴  She hid in his strong arms' fold;
444𓀴And the tale of the flower, crushed
445𓀴  And spurned, was once more told.
446𓀴
447𓀴
448𓀴_LIFE_
449𓀴
450𓀴An infant wailing in nameless fear;
451𓀴  A shadow, perchance, in the quiet room,
452𓀴Or the hum of an insect flying near,
453𓀴  Or the screech-owl's cry, in the outer gloom.
454𓀴
455𓀴A little child on the sun-checked floor,
456𓀴  A broken toy, and a tear-stained face,
457𓀴A young life clouded, a young heart sore;
458𓀴  And the great clock, time, ticks on apace.
459𓀴
460𓀴A maiden weeping in bitter pain,
461𓀴  Two white hands clasped on an aching brow.
462𓀴A blighted faith and a fond hope slain,
463𓀴  A shattered trust and a broken vow.
464𓀴
465𓀴A matron holding a baby's shoe,
466𓀴  The hot tears gather, and fall at will
467𓀴On the knotted ribbon of white and blue,
468𓀴  For the foot that wore it is cold and still.
469𓀴
470𓀴An aged woman upon her bed,
471𓀴  Worn, and wearied, and poor and old,
472𓀴Longing to rest with the happy dead.
473𓀴  And thus the story of life is told.
474𓀴
475𓀴Where is the season of careless glee?
476𓀴  Where is the moment that holds no pain?
477𓀴Life has its crosses from infancy
478𓀴  Down to the grave; and its hopes are vain.

484𓀴_STARS_
485𓀴
486𓀴Astronomers may gaze the heavens o'er,
487𓀴  Discovering wonders, great, perhaps, and true!
488𓀴That stars are worlds, and peopled like our own,
489𓀴  But I shall never think as these men do.
490𓀴
491𓀴I shall believe them little shining things,
492𓀴  Fashioned from heavenly ore, and filled with light.
493𓀴And to the sky above, so smoothly blue,
494𓀴  An angel comes and nails them, every night.
495𓀴
496𓀴And I have seen him. You no doubt would think
497𓀴  A white cloud, sailed across the heavens blue.
498𓀴But as I watched the feathery thing, it was
499𓀴  An angel nailing up the stars I knew.
500𓀴
501𓀴And all night long they shine for us below;
502𓀴  Shine in pale splendor, till the mighty sun
503𓀴Wakes up again. And then the angel comes,
504𓀴  And gathers in his treasures, one by one.
505𓀴
506𓀴How sweet the task! Oh, when this life is done,
507𓀴  And I have joined the angel band on high,
508𓀴Of all that throng, oh may it be my lot.
509𓀴  To nail the stars upon the evening sky.
510𓀴
511𓀴1868.

513𓀴
514𓀴_FADING_
515𓀴
516𓀴She sits beside the window. All who pass
517𓀴  Turn once again to gaze on her sweet face.
518𓀴She is so fair; but soon, too soon, alas,
519𓀴  To lie down in her last low resting place.
520𓀴
521𓀴No gems are brighter than her sparkling eyes.
522𓀴  Her brow like polished marble, white and fair--
523𓀴Her cheeks as glowing as the sunset skies--
524𓀴  You would not dream that death was lurking there.
525𓀴
526𓀴But, oh! he lingers closely at her side.
527𓀴  And when the forest dons its Autumn dress,
528𓀴We know that he will claim her as his bride,
529𓀴  And earth will number one fair spirit less.
530𓀴
531𓀴She sees the meadow robed in richest green--
532𓀴  The laughing stream--the willows bending o'er.
533𓀴With tear dimmed eyes she views each sylvan scene,
534𓀴  And thinks earth never was so fair before.
535𓀴
536𓀴We do not sigh for Heaven, till we have known,
537𓀴  Something of sorrow, something of grief and woe,
538𓀴And as a summer day her life has flown.
539𓀴  Then, can we wonder she is loath to go?
540𓀴
541𓀴She has no friends in Heaven: all are here.
542𓀴  No lost one waits her in that unknown land,
543𓀴And life grows doubly, trebly sweet and dear,
544𓀴  As day by day, she nears the mystic strand.
545𓀴
546𓀴We love her and we grieve to see her go.
547𓀴  But it is Christ who calls her to His breast,
548𓀴And He shall greet her, and she soon shall know
549𓀴  The joys of souls that dwell among the blest.

554𓀴_HAUNTED_
555𓀴
556𓀴"We walk upon the sea-shore, you and I,
557𓀴  Just two alone," you say. But there are three;
558𓀴A tall and manly form is walking nigh,
559𓀴  And as I move, he moves along with me.
560𓀴
561𓀴Your shadow? No, for shadows do not speak,
562𓀴  And he is speaking, tenderly and low,
563𓀴Words that bring crimson blushes to my cheek,
564𓀴  You cannot hear, the sea is sounding so.
565𓀴
566𓀴But it is strange you cannot see him there,
567𓀴  My darling with the broad and snowy brow.
568𓀴You never saw a face so grandly fair.
569𓀴  I'll stand aside--there, do you see him now?
570𓀴
571𓀴No! well you jest, or else you're growing blind;
572𓀴  Blue eyes are never very strong, you know;
573𓀴This summer sun and wind are bad combined,
574𓀴  You should not walk here where the sea gales blow.
575𓀴
576𓀴Ah, he who walks here at my side has eyes
577𓀴  That sun, nor wind can dim their eagle sight,
578𓀴You've seen the thunder cloud in stormy skies--
579𓀴  Well, so his eyes are, full of purple light.
580𓀴
581𓀴Dead! what a foolish thing for you to say,
582𓀴  When I can see him walking at my side;
583𓀴Just as we walked a year ago to-day,
584𓀴  When first I promised him to be his bride.
585𓀴
586𓀴Go, leave us. We had rather be alone.
587𓀴  Your words are wild to-day. Go, let me be
588𓀴With him a while. And when an hour has flown
589𓀴  I'll follow you. But now he waits for me.
590𓀴
591𓀴
592𓀴_GHOSTS_
593𓀴
594𓀴    There are ghosts in the room,
595𓀴As I sit here alone, from the dark corners there
596𓀴    They come out of the gloom
597𓀴And they stand at my side, and they lean on my chair.
598𓀴
599𓀴    There's the ghost of a hope
600𓀴That lighted my days with a fanciful glow.
601𓀴    In her hand is the rope
602𓀴That strangled her life out. Hope was slain long ago.
603𓀴
604𓀴    But her ghost comes to-night,
605𓀴With its skeleton face, and expressionless eyes,
606𓀴    And it stands in the light,
607𓀴And mocks me, and jeers me with sobs and with sighs.
608𓀴
609𓀴    There's the ghost of a Joy,
610𓀴A frail, fragile thing, and I prized it too much,
611𓀴    And the hands that destroy
612𓀴Clasped it close, and it died at the withering touch.
613𓀴
614𓀴    There's the ghost of a love,
615𓀴Born with joy, reared with Hope, died in pain and unrest,
616𓀴    But he towers above
617𓀴All the others--this ghost: yet a ghost at the best.
618𓀴
619𓀴    I am weary, and fain
620𓀴Would forget all these dead: but the gibbering host
621𓀴    Make the struggle in vain,
622𓀴In each shadowy corner, there lurketh a ghost.

627𓀴_TIM'S STORY_
628𓀴
629𓀴I was out promenading one fine summer day,
630𓀴When I chanced upon three bosom cronies to stray,
631𓀴And a beer shop we happened to pass on our way.
632𓀴
633𓀴"Now boys," said I, stopping them all with a wink,
634𓀴"If you'll step round the corner, I'll treat to a drink;
635𓀴How is it, my hearties? now, what do you think?"
636𓀴
637𓀴So, into the bar-room we dropped in a flash,
638𓀴And up to the keeper I went with a dash:
639𓀴"Four glasses of lager, and none of your trash,
640𓀴But the best and the foamiest money can bring,"
641𓀴Was the order I gave, with the air of a king;
642𓀴And mine host fluttered off, like a bird on the wing.
643𓀴
644𓀴Just then an old toper dropped in from the street,
645𓀴A jolly old soak, with a nose like a beet.
646𓀴And he said, "Now, my rummys, I'll share in that treat."
647𓀴
648𓀴But I said to my cronies, "Say boys, look ye there!
649𓀴Do you 'spose such a nosey will fall to our share?"
650𓀴Quoth the toper, "Keep drinking, my lads, and you'll wear
651𓀴A nose like my own, or I miss in my guess."
652𓀴"Why," said Ned, "it resembles the light of distress."
653𓀴Said Tom, "It's the color of Sally Ann's dress."
654𓀴
655𓀴Said Billy, "It looks like the sun's ruddy bed,
656𓀴And shines like the top of my grandfather's head."
657𓀴Said I, "It is ready, I think, to be bled."
658𓀴
659𓀴"Now thank ye, my lads," said old soak with a bow,
660𓀴"But gulp down your lager, 'twill soon show ye how
661𓀴Red noses are painted and polished, I vow."
662𓀴
663𓀴I turned to my cronies: "Now, boys, look ye here!
664𓀴I wouldn't, I say, for ten thousand a year,
665𓀴Have my nose grow to look like the one beaming near!"
666𓀴
667𓀴"Nor I, sir!" "Nor I, sir!" "Nor I!" cried each chum;
668𓀴Then, said I, "A good-bye to all beer, ale, and rum,
669𓀴And hurrah for cold water! my boys, will ye come?"
670𓀴
671𓀴"We are ready and willing," said Tom, Bill and Ned.
672𓀴"Let's get us a pledge, boys, and sign it," I said--
673𓀴And so at next meeting, four names were read
674𓀴In the Temperance column. And now should you be
675𓀴In these parts, and a fine-looking fellow should see,
676𓀴You may know it is one of my cronies, or me.
677𓀴
678𓀴By lectures, and preaching, some fellows are won,
679𓀴But you see it is different with us: it was done
680𓀴By the jolly old soak, with a nose like the sun!

685𓀴_MEMORY'S GARDEN_
686𓀴
687𓀴Back on its golden hinges
688𓀴  The gate of Memory swings,
689𓀴And my heart goes into the garden
690𓀴  And walks with the olden things.
691𓀴The old-time, joys and pleasures.
692𓀴  The loves that it used to know,
693𓀴It meets there in the garden.
694𓀴  And they wander to and fro.
695𓀴
696𓀴It heareth a peal of laughter,
697𓀴  It seeth a face most fair.
698𓀴It thrills with a wild, strange rapture
699𓀴  At the glance of a dark eye there;
700𓀴It strayeth under the sunset
701𓀴  In the midst of a merry throng,
702𓀴And beats in a tuneful measure,
703𓀴  To the snatch of a floating song.
704𓀴
705𓀴It heareth a strain of music
706𓀴  Swell on the dreamy air,
707𓀴A strain that is never sounded,
708𓀴  Save in the garden there.
709𓀴It wanders among the roses,
710𓀴  And thrills at a long-lost kiss,
711𓀴And glows at the touch of fingers,
712𓀴  In a tremor of foolish bliss.
713𓀴
714𓀴But all is not fair in the garden,--
715𓀴  There's a sorrowing sob of pain;
716𓀴There are tear-drops, bitter, scalding,
717𓀴  And the roses are tempest-slain.
718𓀴And I shut the gate of the garden.
719𓀴  And walk in the Present's ways.
720𓀴For its quiet paths are better
721𓀴  Than the pain of those vanished days!
722𓀴
723𓀴
724𓀴_MYSTERIES_
725𓀴
726𓀴In God's vast wisdom, infinite and grand--
727𓀴  Too vast, too infinite, for mortal mind--
728𓀴There are some things I cannot understand.
729𓀴  In all His paths, in all His ways, I find
730𓀴Some subtle mysteries of life and death--
731𓀴  Some marvels that I cannot comprehend,
732𓀴Nor can I hope to know them till the end,
733𓀴  When all shall be made plain, above--beneath.
734𓀴
735𓀴There are so many of His righteous deeds--
736𓀴  There is so much that unto me is plain,
737𓀴I have no time to wonder--have no needs
738𓀴  To question why, and wherefore. In the main
739𓀴My _mortal_ eyes see that His works are good.
740𓀴  Whatever else seems strange, and dark, and dim,
741𓀴I am content to leave in faith with Him,
742𓀴  And in His time, it will be understood.
743𓀴
744𓀴These labyrinths wherein many souls are lost--
745𓀴  These waters, whereon some barks lose the shore,
746𓀴But draw me nearer to the Heavenly Host,
747𓀴  But make me love and worship God the more.
748𓀴There is enough that I do see and know--
749𓀴  There is enough that I can understand,
750𓀴And sometime Christ shall take me by the hand.
751𓀴  Explaining all that seems so strange below.

756𓀴_WHAT THE WINDS TOLD ME_
757𓀴
758𓀴The winds come from the West,
759𓀴  Come softly, mildly,
760𓀴"What tidings do you bring?"
761𓀴  I questioned wildly.
762𓀴They sang a tender tune,
763𓀴  And answered lightly--
764𓀴"Your darling's path is fair!
765𓀴  The sun shines brightly."
766𓀴
767𓀴The winds came from the West,
768𓀴  Came shrieking, groaning.
769𓀴"What tidings now, oh wind?"
770𓀴  My heart cried moaning.
771𓀴They answered loud, and wild,
772𓀴  "When danger stalketh--
773𓀴And death is waiting, near,
774𓀴  Your darling walketh."
775𓀴
776𓀴The winds came from the West,
777𓀴  Came weeping, wailing.
778𓀴"Oh, tell me, tell me, winds!"
779𓀴  My heart cried, failing.
780𓀴"Where none are near to soothe,"
781𓀴  They answered sighing,
782𓀴"In loneliness and pain,
783𓀴  Your love is dying!"
784𓀴
785𓀴The winds came from the West!
786𓀴  Came sadly sobbing.
787𓀴And with an awful fear,
788𓀴  My heart was throbbing.
789𓀴I wildly questioned them
790𓀴  Amidst my weeping,
791𓀴"All still, and white," they said,
792𓀴  "Your love is sleeping."

795𓀴
796𓀴
797𓀴_SOMETIMES_
798𓀴
799𓀴Sometimes when I am all alone,
800𓀴  Away from noise and strife,
801𓀴The many faults and weaknesses,
802𓀴  That rule my daily life
803𓀴Seem to die out. And as I sit
804𓀴  From worldliness apart,
805𓀴All that is good and pure obtains
806𓀴  The mastery of my heart.
807𓀴
808𓀴And then my soul turns heavenward,
809𓀴  And I commune with God.
810𓀴I long to tread the narrow path
811𓀴  That Christ before me trod.
812𓀴I long to see his precious face--
813𓀴  To go where angels go,
814𓀴To leave the fleeting, fading things
815𓀴  That make up life below.
816𓀴
817𓀴My soul expands with ecstasy,
818𓀴  My heart grows brave, and strong,
819𓀴To meet whatever lies ahead--
820𓀴  To battle down the wrong.
821𓀴No sorrow can affright my soul,
822𓀴  No earthly ill, I fear,
823𓀴While in that blessed trance I sit
824𓀴  And feel that God is near.
825𓀴
826𓀴And then I mingle with the world.
827𓀴  And falter day by day,
828𓀴Until at last I walk within
829𓀴  The olden, sinful way.
830𓀴O, shall I even grow in grace,
831𓀴  O shall I ever be,
832𓀴Ready to meet the judgment day--
833𓀴  Fit for eternity?

835𓀴1869.
836𓀴
837𓀴
838𓀴_BLIND SORROW_
839𓀴
840𓀴One bitter time of mourning, I remember,
841𓀴  When day, and night, my sad heart did complain,
842𓀴My life, I said, was one cold, bleak December,
843𓀴  And all its pleasures, were but whited pain.
844𓀴
845𓀴Nothing could rouse me from my sullen sorrow,
846𓀴  Because you were not near, I would not smile.
847𓀴And from a score of joys refused to borrow
848𓀴  One ray of light, to gild the weary while.
849𓀴
850𓀴But all the blessing God has given, scorning,
851𓀴  I wept because we were so far apart,
852𓀴And spent my time in idle, aimless mourning,
853𓀴  That only kept the grief fresh in my heart--
854𓀴
855𓀴God pity me! I know now we were nearer.
856𓀴  With all these intervening miles of space--
857𓀴That life was sweeter, and the future dearer.
858𓀴  Than when to-day I met you, face to face!
859𓀴
860𓀴God meant to break it gently--ease my anguish,
861𓀴  But I rebelled, and caviled at His will.
862𓀴Now, seeing His great wisdom, though I languish,
863𓀴  In bitter pain, I trust His mercy still.
864𓀴
865𓀴
866𓀴_"BE NOT WEARY"_
867𓀴
868𓀴Sometimes, when I am toil-worn and aweary,
869𓀴  All tired out, with working long, and well,
870𓀴And earth is dark, and skies above are dreary,
871𓀴  And heart and soul are all too sick to tell,
872𓀴These words have come to me, like angel fingers,
873𓀴  Pressing the spirit eyelids down in sleep.
874𓀴"Oh, let us not be weary in well doing,
875𓀴  For in due season, we shall surely reap."
876𓀴
877𓀴Oh, blessed promise! when I seem to hear it,
878𓀴  Whispered by angel voices on the air,
879𓀴It breathes new life, and courage to my spirit,
880𓀴  And gives me strength to suffer and forbear.
881𓀴And I can wait most patiently for harvest,
882𓀴  And cast my seeds, nor ever faint, nor weep,
883𓀴If I know surely, that my work availeth,
884𓀴  And in God's season, I at last shall reap.
885𓀴
886𓀴When mind and body were borne down completely
887𓀴  And I have thought my efforts were all vain,
888𓀴These words have come to me, so softly, sweetly,
889𓀴  And whispered hope, and urged me on again.
890𓀴And though my labor seems all unavailing,
891𓀴  And all my strivings fruitless, yet the Lord
892𓀴Doth treasure up each little seed I scatter,
893𓀴  And sometime, _sometime_, I shall reap reward.

895𓀴1870.

897𓀴
898𓀴_TO THOSE WHO NEVER PRAY_
899𓀴
900𓀴O! you who never bend the knee,
901𓀴  And never lift the heart,
902𓀴How do you live from year to year,
903𓀴  And living, act your part.
904𓀴
905𓀴How do you rise up in the morn,
906𓀴  And pass the whole day through,
907𓀴Without the Saviour at your side
908𓀴  To guide and strengthen you.
909𓀴
910𓀴How do you meet the daily ills
911𓀴  That try the temper so!
912𓀴That fret the heart and wear the soul
913𓀴  More than some master woe.
914𓀴
915𓀴How do you close your eyes and sleep,
916𓀴  And how your crosses bear;
917𓀴(Each has a cross, or small, or large)
918𓀴  Without the aid of prayer?
919𓀴
920𓀴How do you meet the mighty griefs,
921𓀴  That rush upon the soul,
922𓀴Engulfing it in bitterness.
923𓀴  As angry waters roll?
924𓀴
925𓀴How do you live _at all_, is one
926𓀴  Deep mystery to me.
927𓀴Oh, you who never lift the heart
928𓀴  And never bend the knee.

933𓀴_HUNG_
934𓀴
935𓀴Nine o'clock, and the sun shines as yellow and warm,
936𓀴As though 'twere a fete day. I wish it would storm:
937𓀴    Wish the thunder would crash,
938𓀴    And the red lightning flash,
939𓀴And lap the black clouds, with its serpentine tongue--
940𓀴The day is _too_ calm, for a man to be hung.
941𓀴    Hung! ugh, what a word!
942𓀴The most heartless, and horrible, ear ever heard.
943𓀴
944𓀴He has murdered, and plundered, and robbed, so "they say,"
945𓀴Been the scourge of the country, for many a day.
946𓀴    He was lawless and wild;
947𓀴    Man, woman, or child
948𓀴Met no mercy, no pity, if found in his path.
949𓀴He was worse than a beast of the woods, in his wrath.
950𓀴    And yet--to be _hung_,
951𓀴    Oh, my God! to be swung
952𓀴By the neck to, and fro, for the rabble to see--
953𓀴    The thought sickens me.
954𓀴
955𓀴Thirty minutes past nine. How the time hurries by,
956𓀴But a half hour remains, at ten he will die.
957𓀴    Die? No! he'll be _killed!_
958𓀴    For God never willed
959𓀴    Men should die in this way.
960𓀴"Vengeance is mine," He saith, "I will repay."
961𓀴    Yet what could be done,
962𓀴    With this wild, lawless one!
963𓀴No prison could hold him, and so--he must swing,
964𓀴    It's a horrible thing.
965𓀴
966𓀴Outcast, Desperado, Fiend, Knave; all of these
967𓀴And more. But call him whatever you please
968𓀴    I cannot forget,
969𓀴    He's a mortal man yet:
970𓀴That he once was a babe, and was hushed into rest,
971𓀴And fondled, and pressed, to a woman's warm breast.
972𓀴    Was sung to, and rocked,
973𓀴    And when he first walked
974𓀴With his weak little feet, he was petted, and told
975𓀴He was "mamma's own pet, worth his whole weight in gold."
976𓀴    And this is the end
977𓀴Of a God-given life. Just think of it, friend!
978𓀴
979𓀴Hark! hear you that chime? 'tis the clock striking ten.
980𓀴The dread weight falls down, with a sound like "amen."
981𓀴Does murder pay murder? do two wrongs make a right?
982𓀴    Oh, that horrible sight!
983𓀴I am shut in my room, and have covered my face;
984𓀴But the dread scene has followed me into this place.
985𓀴    I see that strange thing,
986𓀴    Like a clock pendulum swing
987𓀴To and fro, in the air, back and forth, to and fro.
988𓀴    One moment ago
989𓀴'Twas a man, in God's image! now hide it, kind grave!
990𓀴What a terrible end, to the life that God gave.

995𓀴_COMPASSION_
996𓀴
997𓀴There is a picture, that I sometimes see,
998𓀴  Of Jesus, with a child upon his breast.
999𓀴And other children clustered at his knee--
1000𓀴  The little lambs of God, that he had blest.
1001𓀴And this one--lying on the Saviour's arm
1002𓀴  Looks up and smiles, in that most sainted face,
1003𓀴And knowing he is well secured from harm
1004𓀴  He falls asleep in that safe resting place.
1005𓀴
1006𓀴To-night I am so weary, heart, and soul.
1007𓀴  So worn out, with a thousand nameless ills.
1008𓀴My spirit longs intensely for its goal
1009𓀴  And every fibre of my being thrills
1010𓀴With mighty yearning. "Oh, to be that child--
1011𓀴  To lie upon my Saviour's breast." I weep,
1012𓀴"And looking on that face so meekly mild.
1013𓀴  Forget my tears, and sweetly fall asleep."
1014𓀴
1015𓀴It is not always so: sometimes the earth
1016𓀴  And earthly friends, can satisfy my heart.
1017𓀴But now--to-night--I feel their shallow worth,
1018𓀴  And feel, Oh, Christ my Saviour, that Thou art
1019𓀴And Thou alone, the only faithful friend
1020𓀴  Who knowing all my sins, and seeing me
1021𓀴Just as I am, will pity to the end
1022𓀴  And in compassion, judge me tenderly.
1023𓀴
1024𓀴I am so weak, and sinful--every day
1025𓀴  The sins and failings that I most condemn,
1026𓀴And most abhor in others--I straightway
1027𓀴  Go forth, and wickedly walk into them.
1028𓀴But Christ, who was in mortal form one time
1029𓀴  And dwelt upon the earth, will understand.
1030𓀴And through a love and pity most sublime,
1031𓀴  Will write me out a pardon with His hand.

1034𓀴
1035𓀴
1036𓀴_FAME_
1037𓀴
1038𓀴    If I should die, to-day.
1039𓀴  To-morrow, maybe, the world would see--
1040𓀴  Would waken from sleep, and say,
1041𓀴"Why here was talent! why here was worth!
1042𓀴Why here was a luminous light o' the earth.
1043𓀴      A soul as free
1044𓀴      As the winds of the sea:
1045𓀴      To whom was given
1046𓀴      A dower of heaven.
1047𓀴And fame, and name, and glory belongs
1048𓀴To this dead singer of living songs.
1049𓀴Bring hither a wreath, for the bride of death!"
1050𓀴And so, they would praise me, and so they would raise me
1051𓀴  Mayhap, a column, high over the bed
1052𓀴  Where I should be lying, all cold and dead.
1053𓀴
1054𓀴    But I am a _living_ poet!
1055𓀴    Walking abroad in the sunlight of God,
1056𓀴    Not lying asleep, where the clay worms creep,
1057𓀴      And the cold world will not show it,
1058𓀴E'en when it sees that my song should please;
1059𓀴But sneering says: "Avaunt, with thy lays!
1060𓀴Do not sing them, and do not bring them
1061𓀴    Into this rustling, bustling life.
1062𓀴We have no time, for a jingling rhyme,
1063𓀴In this scene of hurrying, worrying strife."
1064𓀴    And so, I say, there is but one way
1065𓀴To win me a name, and bring me fame.
1066𓀴And that is, to die, and be buried low,
1067𓀴When the world would praise me, an hour or so.

1072𓀴_HER MOTHER'S BEAUTIFUL EYES_
1073𓀴
1074𓀴I met a young girl on the street;
1075𓀴  I was a stranger to her, no more.
1076𓀴  But the glance of her brown eyes, shy and sweet,
1077𓀴    Set me to dreaming of days of yore.
1078𓀴      Ah! _she_ does not know, but long ago
1079𓀴When life was as cloudless as June's blue skies,
1080𓀴Her _mother_ was all the world to me;
1081𓀴      And she
1082𓀴Has her mother's beautiful eyes.
1083𓀴
1084𓀴  She lifted her lashes, and let them fall;
1085𓀴    Raised them and dropped them as I passed by.
1086𓀴  A grizzled old stranger, that was all
1087𓀴    _She_ saw, for she could not know that I
1088𓀴        In the dear, dear past
1089𓀴        Too sweet to last
1090𓀴  Had found my Eden, my paradise.
1091𓀴  In her mother's beautiful eyes.
1092𓀴
1093𓀴  I loved, and was loved. But a word was said
1094𓀴    In thoughtless jest, and the work was done.
1095𓀴  The hopes I had cherished, lay blasted, dead--
1096𓀴    My rival pleaded his suit, and won.
1097𓀴And their child--ah me! is fair to see;
1098𓀴I wonder if she's as good and wise,
1099𓀴As sweet and kind, and pure of mind
1100𓀴As the one who bequeathed her those beautiful eyes.
1101𓀴
1102𓀴  She has her father's step, and air.
1103𓀴    Her father's brow, and his pale, dark cheek.
1104𓀴  And her father's tawny, curling hair.
1105𓀴    And her father's mouth, half sweet, half weak.
1106𓀴        All very true.
1107𓀴And "she's like her father through and through,"
1108𓀴    I said when we met on the street that day,
1109𓀴    "And not like her mother in any way."
1110𓀴  Then I caught my breath with a start of surprise,
1111𓀴      (That she did not see)
1112𓀴For the child of my rival glanced up at me
1113𓀴  With her mother's beautiful eyes.

1117𓀴
1118𓀴_OLD TIMES_
1119𓀴
1120𓀴Friend of my youth, let us talk of old times;
1121𓀴  Of the long-lost golden hours.
1122𓀴When "Winter" meant only Christmas chimes,
1123𓀴  And "Summer" wreaths of flowers.
1124𓀴Life has grown old, and cold, my friend,
1125𓀴  And the winter now, means death.
1126𓀴And summer blossoms speak all too plain
1127𓀴  Of the dear, dead forms beneath.
1128𓀴
1129𓀴But let us talk of the past to-night;
1130𓀴  And live it over again,
1131𓀴We will put the long years out of sight.
1132𓀴  And dream we are young as then.
1133𓀴But you must not look at me, my friend,
1134𓀴  And I must not look at you,
1135𓀴Or the furrowed brows, and silvered locks,
1136𓀴  Will prove our dream untrue.
1137𓀴
1138𓀴Let us sing of the summer, too sweet to last.
1139𓀴  And yet too sweet to die.
1140𓀴Let us read tales, from the book of the past,
1141𓀴  And talk of the days gone by.
1142𓀴We will turn our backs to the West, my friend,
1143𓀴  And forget we are growing old.
1144𓀴The skies of the Present are dull, and gray,
1145𓀴  But the Past's are blue, and gold.
1146𓀴
1147𓀴The sun has passed over the noontide line
1148𓀴  And is sinking down the West.
1149𓀴And of friends we knew in days Lang Syne,
1150𓀴  Full half have gone to rest.
1151𓀴And the few that are left on earth, my friend
1152𓀴  Are scattered far, and wide.
1153𓀴But you and I will talk of the days
1154𓀴  Ere any roamed, or died.
1155𓀴
1156𓀴Auburn ringlets, and hazel eyes--
1157𓀴  Blue eyes and tresses of gold.
1158𓀴Winds joy laden, and azure skies,
1159𓀴  Belong to those days of old.
1160𓀴We will leave the Present's shores awhile
1161𓀴  And float on the Past's smooth sea.
1162𓀴But I must not look at you, my friend,
1163𓀴  And you must not look at me.
1164𓀴
1165𓀴1871.

1168𓀴_THIS WORLD_
1169𓀴
1170𓀴This world is a sad, sad place I know;
1171𓀴  And what soul living can doubt it.
1172𓀴But it will not lessen the want and woe,
1173𓀴  To be always singing about it.
1174𓀴Then away with the songs that are full of tears,
1175𓀴  Away with dirges that sadden.
1176𓀴Let us make the most of our fleeting years,
1177𓀴  By singing the lays that gladden.
1178𓀴
1179𓀴The world at its saddest is not all sad--
1180𓀴  There are days of sunny weather.
1181𓀴And the people within it are not all bad,
1182𓀴  But saints and sinners together.
1183𓀴I think those wonderful hours in June,
1184𓀴  Are better by far, to remember,
1185𓀴Than those when the world gets out of tune
1186𓀴  In the cold, bleak winds of November.
1187𓀴Because we meet in the walks of life
1188𓀴  Many a selfish creature,
1189𓀴It does not prove that this world of strife
1190𓀴  Has no redeeming feature.
1191𓀴There is bloom, and beauty upon the earth,
1192𓀴  There are buds and blossoming flowers,
1193𓀴There are souls of truth, and hearts of worth--
1194𓀴  There are glowing, golden hours.
1195𓀴
1196𓀴In thinking over a joy we've known,
1197𓀴  We easily make it double.
1198𓀴Which is better by far, than to mope and moan,
1199𓀴  Over sorrow and grief and trouble.
1200𓀴For though this world is sad, we know,
1201𓀴  (And who that is living can doubt it,)
1202𓀴It will not lessen the want, or woe,
1203𓀴  To be always singing about it.
1204𓀴
1205𓀴1872.
1206𓀴
1207𓀴
1208𓀴_GOING AWAY_
1209𓀴
1210𓀴Walking to-day on the Common,
1211𓀴  I heard a stranger say
1212𓀴To a friend who was standing near him,
1213𓀴  "Do you know I am going away?"
1214𓀴I had never seen their faces:
1215𓀴  May never see them again,
1216𓀴But the words the stranger uttered,
1217𓀴  Stirred me with nameless pain.
1218𓀴
1219𓀴For I knew some heart would miss him,
1220𓀴  Would ache at his "going away,"
1221𓀴And the earth would seem all cheerless,
1222𓀴  For many and many a day.
1223𓀴No matter how glad my spirit,
1224𓀴  No matter how light my heart,
1225𓀴If I hear these two words uttered,
1226𓀴  The tear drops always start.
1227𓀴
1228𓀴They are so sad and solemn,
1229𓀴  So full of a lonely sound:
1230𓀴Like dead leaves rustling downward,
1231𓀴  And dropping upon the ground.
1232𓀴Oh, I pity the naked branches,
1233𓀴  When the skies are dull and gray,
1234𓀴And the last leaf whispers softly,
1235𓀴  "Good bye, I am going away."
1236𓀴
1237𓀴In the dreary, dripping Autumn,
1238𓀴  The wings of the flying birds
1239𓀴As they soar away to the southland,
1240𓀴  Seem always to say these words.
1241𓀴Where ever they may be uttered,
1242𓀴  They fall with a sob, and sigh;
1243𓀴And heart-aches follow the sentence,
1244𓀴  "I am going away--Good bye."
1245𓀴
1246𓀴Oh, God, in Thy blessed kingdom
1247𓀴  No lips shall ever say,
1248𓀴No ears shall ever hearken.
1249𓀴  To the words "I am going away."
1250𓀴For no soul ever wearies
1251𓀴  Of the dear, bright, angel band,
1252𓀴And no saint ever wanders,
1253𓀴  From the sunny, golden land.
1254𓀴
1255𓀴1872.
1256𓀴
1257𓀴
1258𓀴_GOOD BYE_
1259𓀴
1260𓀴He rose, and passing, paused by her.
1261𓀴  They stood a moment in the door.
1262𓀴His dark eyes made her pulses stir
1263𓀴  As they had never stirred before;
1264𓀴How soft the night bird sang above
1265𓀴The dull brown heath. Oh, Life, Oh, Love!
1266𓀴
1267𓀴He took her hand, and said "Good bye."
1268𓀴  Then, singing blithely, went across
1269𓀴The sodden fields: nor heard the cry
1270𓀴  Her heart sent up, nor knew her loss.
1271𓀴How bleak, and wild, and desolate,
1272𓀴The wind blew down. Oh, Love, Oh, Fate!
1273𓀴
1274𓀴The west turned suddenly aflame;
1275𓀴  Striped here and there with blue and gold.
1276𓀴She shook with chills she could not name.
1277𓀴  The air seemed strangely harsh, and cold.
1278𓀴How keen the winds were, and how rife
1279𓀴With wintry sounds. Oh, Love, Oh, Life!
1280𓀴
1281𓀴She waited till she saw him pass
1282𓀴  Across the meadow, out of sight.
1283𓀴His shadow fell upon the grass;
1284𓀴  The winds were talking of the night.
1285𓀴How high they whirled the withered leaf;
1286𓀴How swift it flew. Oh, Love, Oh, Grief.
1287𓀴
1288𓀴She shut the door, and turned away.
1289𓀴  Some task was waiting for her hand.
1290𓀴She shut another door, where lay,
1291𓀴  Her sweet dead hope. You understand.
1292𓀴"And they shall weep no more," God saith,
1293𓀴"Nor taste of pain." Oh, Life, Oh, Death.
1294𓀴
1295𓀴
1296𓀴_JAMIE_
1297𓀴
1298𓀴In through the kitchen, the boys came trooping:
1299𓀴  Will, and Sammy, and Bob and Fred,
1300𓀴And Johnny and Jamie, the twins, came after,
1301𓀴Setting the rafters, a-ring with laughter.
1302𓀴  Woe for the words I said!
1303𓀴I looked at the floor I had swept and dusted,
1304𓀴  And saw the litter the twelve feet brought;
1305𓀴And I sighed, and frowned, on the six bright blossoms,
1306𓀴  And frowning, spoke my thought.
1307𓀴
1308𓀴"Oh, was there ever so weary a woman!
1309𓀴  I have been only twelve years wed.
1310𓀴But I've never a moment of peace or quiet.
1311𓀴Six rough boys, with their noise and riot,
1312𓀴  Are wearing me out," I said.
1313𓀴"Six rough boys to mend and work for,
1314𓀴  To clothe and feed--it is hard at best;
1315𓀴There's never an end to my weary labors,
1316𓀴  There is no time for rest."
1317𓀴
1318𓀴Dark fell the shadows around my little cottage,
1319𓀴  Weeping I leaned over one little bed,
1320𓀴Vain were the tears on the tiny face falling;
1321𓀴In the dim distance I heard a voice calling--
1322𓀴  "Come unto me," it said.
1323𓀴And down through the starlight an angel descended,
1324𓀴  And stood by my Jamie's low bedside.
1325𓀴"Come! there is room with the angels," she whispered,
1326𓀴  "Heaven is fair and wide."
1327𓀴
1328𓀴"Fair are its meadows, and wide are its mansions,
1329𓀴  And thousands of children are gathered there."
1330𓀴Vain were the prayers that I prayed, leaning o'er him,
1331𓀴Up to the mansions of heaven she bore him.
1332𓀴  Woe for my heart's despair!
1333𓀴Oh, to recall the harsh words that I uttered!
1334𓀴  Oh, for his litter and noise to-day!
1335𓀴Oh, for the labor his hands would make me!
1336𓀴  Hands that are turned to clay.
1337𓀴
1338𓀴Five sturdy boys troop into my cottage,
1339𓀴  John, Will, Sammy, and Bob and Fred--
1340𓀴Five brave boys as e'er blessed a mother.
1341𓀴But always and ever I miss the other,
1342𓀴  The dear, dear boy that is dead.
1343𓀴I miss the ring of his childish laughter,
1344𓀴  Miss him and mourn for him night and day,
1345𓀴But wide are the mansions, and fair are the meadows
1346𓀴  Where the feet of my Jamie stray.

1351𓀴_A MOTHER'S REVERIE_
1352𓀴
1353𓀴The shadows drop down o'er the fields tinged with brown,
1354𓀴  Where the snow-drifts were gleaming of late,
1355𓀴And the day shuts her eyes, while th' red western skies
1356𓀴  Make ready the chambers of state.
1357𓀴How still the house seems! while round about gleams
1358𓀴  Th' last mellow rays of th' sun.
1359𓀴There's no step on the stair--no voice anywhere,
1360𓀴  Crying, "Mother, the last task is done!"
1361𓀴
1362𓀴Can it be I'm alone? can it be there are none
1363𓀴  Left of eight, who have called me that name?
1364𓀴Four boys and four girls, with their tresses and curls,
1365𓀴  Four brave boys, four fair girls, that came
1366𓀴To my home one by one, like lost rays from the sun,
1367𓀴  And where are they all now? I pray;
1368𓀴Like birds from the nest, the babes on my breast
1369𓀴  Took wing, and have fluttered away.
1370𓀴
1371𓀴There was John, my first child; as gentle and mild
1372𓀴  As the maiden that grew at his side,--
1373𓀴First to come, last to stay; but death called him away,
1374𓀴  It is two years, to-day since he died.
1375𓀴Hope, Mary, and Joe are all married, and so
1376𓀴  Have gone into homes of their own;
1377𓀴Mark is over the sea, and Flora--hush! we
1378𓀴  Never speak of the one who has flown.
1379𓀴
1380𓀴My Will, bonny Will, fell at Champion Hill--
1381𓀴  My dark-eyed, my raven-tressed son;
1382𓀴There was one at his side fell too; and Kate died
1383𓀴  Of grieving for Will--and that one!
1384𓀴Yet bravely we try, my life-mate and I,
1385𓀴  To be happy and cheerful alway.
1386𓀴God knows best what to do; yet I think if we knew
1387𓀴  She were dead, 'twould seem better to-day.

1392𓀴_THE TWO GLASSES_
1393𓀴
1394𓀴There sat two glasses, filled to the brim,
1395𓀴On a rich man's table, rim to rim.
1396𓀴One was ruddy, and red as blood,
1397𓀴And one was as clear as the crystal flood.

1399𓀴Said the glass of wine to his paler brother,
1400𓀴"Let us tell tales of the past to each other;
1401𓀴I can tell of banquet, and revel, and mirth,
1402𓀴Where I was king, for I ruled in might.
1403𓀴And the proudest and grandest souls on earth
1404𓀴Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight.
1405𓀴From the heads of kings, I have torn the crown,
1406𓀴From the heights of fame, I have hurled men down;
1407𓀴I have blasted many an honored name,
1408𓀴I have taken virtue, and given shame;
1409𓀴I have tempted the youth, with a sip, a taste,
1410𓀴That has made his future a barren waste.
1411𓀴Far greater than any king am I,
1412𓀴Or than any army beneath the sky.
1413𓀴I have made the arm of the driver fail,
1414𓀴And sent the train from its iron rail.
1415𓀴I have made good ships go down at sea,
1416𓀴And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me;
1417𓀴For they said, 'Behold, how great you be!
1418𓀴Fame, strength, wealth, genius, before you fall,
1419𓀴And your might and power are over all.'"
1420𓀴"Ho! ho! pale brother," laughed the wine,
1421𓀴"Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?"
1422𓀴
1423𓀴Said the water glass, "I cannot boast
1424𓀴Of a king dethroned or a murdered host;
1425𓀴But I can tell of hearts that were sad,
1426𓀴By my crystal drops made light and glad.
1427𓀴Of thirsts I have quenched, and brows I've laved;
1428𓀴Of hands I have cooled, and souls I've saved.
1429𓀴I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain;
1430𓀴Slept in the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain.
1431𓀴I have burst my cloud fetters, and dropped from the sky,
1432𓀴And everywhere gladdened the landscape and eye.
1433𓀴I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain,
1434𓀴I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain;
1435𓀴I can tell of the powerful wheel o' the mill,
1436𓀴That ground out the flour, and turned at my will;
1437𓀴I can tell of manhood, debased by you,
1438𓀴That I have uplifted, and crowned anew.
1439𓀴I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,
1440𓀴I gladden the heart of man and maid;
1441𓀴I set the chained wine-captive free,
1442𓀴And all are better for knowing me."
1443𓀴
1444𓀴These are the tales they told each other,
1445𓀴The glass of wine, and its paler brother,
1446𓀴As they sat together, filled to the brim,
1447𓀴On the rich man's table, rim to rim.

1452𓀴_TWILIGHT THOUGHTS_
1453𓀴
1454𓀴The God of the day has vanished
1455𓀴  The light from the hills has fled,
1456𓀴And the hand of an unseen artist,
1457𓀴  Is painting the West all red.
1458𓀴All threaded with gold and crimson,
1459𓀴  And burnished with amber dye,
1460𓀴And tipped with purple shadows,
1461𓀴  The glory flameth high.
1462𓀴
1463𓀴Fair, beautiful world of ours!
1464𓀴  Fair, beautiful world, but oh,
1465𓀴How darkened by pain and sorrow,
1466𓀴  How blackened by sin and woe.
1467𓀴The splendor pales in the heavens
1468𓀴  And dies in a golden gleam,
1469𓀴And alone in the hush of twilight,
1470𓀴  I sit, in a checkered dream.
1471𓀴
1472𓀴I think of the souls that are straying,
1473𓀴  In shadows as black as night,
1474𓀴Of hands that are groping blindly
1475𓀴  In search of the shining light;
1476𓀴Of hearts that are mutely crying,
1477𓀴  And praying for just one ray,
1478𓀴To lead them out of the shadows,
1479𓀴  Into the better way.
1480𓀴
1481𓀴I think of the Father's children
1482𓀴  Who are trying to walk alone,
1483𓀴Who have dropped the hand of the Parent,
1484𓀴  And wander in ways unknown.
1485𓀴Oh, the paths are rough and thorny,
1486𓀴  And I know they cannot stand.
1487𓀴They will faint and fall by the wayside,
1488𓀴  Unguided by God's right hand.
1489𓀴
1490𓀴And I think of the souls that are yearning
1491𓀴  To follow the good and true;
1492𓀴That are striving to live unsullied,
1493𓀴  Yet know not what to do.
1494𓀴And I wonder when God, the Master,
1495𓀴  Shall end this weary strife,
1496𓀴And lead us out of the shadows
1497𓀴  Into the deathless life.

1502𓀴_ONLY A KISS_
1503𓀴
1504𓀴Once, when the summer lay on the hilltops,
1505𓀴  And the sunshine fell like a golden flame,
1506𓀴Out from the city's dust and turmoil
1507𓀴  A gallant, fair-faced stranger came--
1508𓀴Came to rest in our humble cottage
1509𓀴  Till the winds of autumn should blow again,
1510𓀴To walk in the meadow and lie by the brooklet,
1511𓀴  And woo back the strength, that the town had slain.
1512𓀴
1513𓀴I was young, with the foolish heart of a maiden
1514𓀴  That had never been wooed, and the stranger bland
1515𓀴Awoke that heart from its idle dreaming,
1516𓀴  And swept the strings with a master-hand.
1517𓀴I remember the thrill, and the first wild tremor,
1518𓀴  That stirred its depths with a sweet surprise,
1519𓀴When I glanced one day at the handsome stranger,
1520𓀴  And caught the gaze of his deep, dark eyes.
1521𓀴
1522𓀴My cheek grew red with its tell-tale blushes,
1523𓀴  And the knitting dropped from my nerveless grasp;
1524𓀴He stooped, and then, as he gracefully gave it,
1525𓀴  He held my hand in a loving clasp;
1526𓀴We said no word, but he knew my secret,
1527𓀴  He read what lay in my maiden heart,
1528𓀴No vain concealing was needed longer
1529𓀴  To hide the tremor his voice would start.
1530𓀴
1531𓀴We walked in the meadow and by the brooklet,
1532𓀴  My sun-browned hand in his snowy palm;
1533𓀴He said my blushes would shame the roses,
1534𓀴  And my heart stood still in a blissful calm.
1535𓀴He stroked my tresses, my raven ringlets,
1536𓀴  And twined them over his finger fair;
1537𓀴My eyes' dark splendor was full of danger,
1538𓀴  He said, for Cupid was lurking there.
1539𓀴
1540𓀴And once he held me close to his bosom,
1541𓀴  And pressed on my lips a loving kiss;
1542𓀴Oh! how I tremble with shame and anger,
1543𓀴  Even now, as I think of this--
1544𓀴But in that moment, I thought that heaven
1545𓀴  Had suddenly opened and drawn me in,
1546𓀴And kissed with passion the lips, so near me,
1547𓀴  Nor dreamed I was staining my soul with sin.
1548𓀴
1549𓀴But there came a letter one quiet evening
1550𓀴  To the man who was dearer to me than life--
1551𓀴"A picture," he said, as he tore it open,
1552𓀴  "Look, sweet friend, at my fair young wife."
1553𓀴A terrible anguish, a seething anger,
1554𓀴  Heaved my bosom and blanched my cheek,
1555𓀴And he who stood there holding the letter,
1556𓀴  He watched me smiling, but did not speak.
1557𓀴
1558𓀴I took the picture and gazed upon it--
1559𓀴  A sweet young creature with sunny hair
1560𓀴And eyes of blue. "May the good Lord keep you,"
1561𓀴  I said aloud, "in his tender care--
1562𓀴You who are wedded and bound forever
1563𓀴  Unto this man," and I met his eyes--
1564𓀴"This soulless villain, this shameless coward,
1565𓀴  Whose heart is blackened with acted lies."
1566𓀴
1567𓀴My heart swelled full of a terrible hatred,
1568𓀴  And something of murder was burning there,
1569𓀴But a better feeling stole in behind it
1570𓀴  As I looked on the picture sweet and fair;
1571𓀴I turned and left him, and never saw him--
1572𓀴  Never looked on his face again,
1573𓀴And time has tempered my shame and sorrow,
1574𓀴  And soothed and quieted down my pain.
1575𓀴
1576𓀴But I always tremble, in awful anger,
1577𓀴  That wears and worries my waning life,
1578𓀴When I think how he clasped me close to his bosom,
1579𓀴  He--with a lawfully wedded wife.
1580𓀴When I think how I answered his fond caresses,
1581𓀴  And clung to his neck in a trance of bliss,
1582𓀴And the tears of a life time and all my sorrow
1583𓀴  Can never remove the stain of his kiss.

1587𓀴
1588𓀴_WHEN I AM DEAD_
1589𓀴
1590𓀴When I am dead, if some chastened one,
1591𓀴  Seeing the "item," or hearing it said
1592𓀴That my play is over, and my part done,
1593𓀴  And I lie asleep in my narrow bed--
1594𓀴If I could know that some soul would say,
1595𓀴  Speaking aloud or silently,
1596𓀴"In the heat, and burden of the day,
1597𓀴  She gave a refreshing draught to me;"
1598𓀴
1599𓀴Or, "when I was lying nigh unto death,
1600𓀴  She nursed me to life, and to strength again,
1601𓀴And when I labored and struggled for breath,
1602𓀴  She soothed and quieted down my pain;"
1603𓀴Or, "when I was groping in grief and doubt,
1604𓀴  Lost, and turned from the light o' the day,
1605𓀴Her hand reached me and helped me out,
1606𓀴  And led me up to the better way."
1607𓀴
1608𓀴Or, "when I was hated and shunned by all,
1609𓀴  Bowing under my sin and my shame,
1610𓀴She, once, in passing me by, let fall
1611𓀴  Words of pity and hope that came
1612𓀴Into my heart, like a blessed calm
1613𓀴  Over the waves of the stormy sea,
1614𓀴Words of comfort like oil and balm.
1615𓀴  She spake, and the desert blossomed for me."
1616𓀴
1617𓀴Better by far, than a marble tomb--
1618𓀴  Than a monument towering over my head;
1619𓀴(What shall I care, in my quiet room,
1620𓀴  For head board or foot board, when I am dead)
1621𓀴Better than glory, or honors, or fame,
1622𓀴  (Though I am striving for those to-day)
1623𓀴To know that some heart will cherish my name,
1624𓀴  And think of me kindly, with blessings, alway.

1629𓀴_DON'T TALK WHEN YOU'VE NOTHING TO SAY_
1630𓀴
1631𓀴It is well to be free in conversing,
1632𓀴  It is well to be able to chat
1633𓀴With a friend on a subject of interest--
1634𓀴  With a stranger on this thing or that.
1635𓀴Don't aim to be cold or reticent,
1636𓀴  But listen to reason I pray,
1637𓀴And remember this wisest of mottos,
1638𓀴  "Don't talk when you've nothing to say."
1639𓀴
1640𓀴A gay, lively friend, or companion,
1641𓀴  With wits that are ready and quick,
1642𓀴Is better by far, than a stupid,
1643𓀴  And unconversational stick.
1644𓀴Yet speech at the best is but silver,
1645𓀴  While silence is golden alway.
1646𓀴And remember at all times and places,
1647𓀴  Don't talk when you've nothing to say.
1648𓀴
1649𓀴I like to see well informed people
1650𓀴  Who know _what_ to say, _how_ and _when_.
1651𓀴And a little good nonsense and jesting
1652𓀴  Is not out of place, now and then.
1653𓀴But I dread the approach of a Magpie,
1654𓀴  Who chatters from grave themes to gay,
1655𓀴Who talks from the morn to the midnight,
1656𓀴  And always with nothing to say.

1661𓀴_THE FROST FAIRY_
1662𓀴
1663𓀴All day the trees were moaning
1664𓀴  For the leaves that they had lost,
1665𓀴All day they creaked and trembled,
1666𓀴  And the naked branches tossed
1667𓀴And shivered in the north wind
1668𓀴  As he hurried up and down.
1669𓀴Over hill-tops bleak and cheerless,
1670𓀴  Over meadows bare and brown.
1671𓀴
1672𓀴"Oh, my green and tender leaflets.
1673𓀴  Oh, my fair buds, lost and gone!"
1674𓀴So, they moaned through all the daytime,
1675𓀴  So, they groaned till night came on.
1676𓀴And the hoar-frost lurked and listened
1677𓀴  To the wailing, sad refrain,
1678𓀴And he whispered, "wait--be patient--
1679𓀴  I will cover you again;
1680𓀴
1681𓀴"I will deck you in new garments--
1682𓀴  I will clothe you ere the light,
1683𓀴In a sheen of spotless glory--
1684𓀴  In a robe of purest white.
1685𓀴You shall wear the matchless mantle,
1686𓀴  That the good Frost Fairy weaves."
1687𓀴And the bare trees listened, wondered,
1688𓀴  And forgot their fallen leaves.
1689𓀴
1690𓀴And the quaint and silent fairy,
1691𓀴  Backward, forward, through the gloom,
1692𓀴Wove the matchless, glittering mantle,
1693𓀴  Spun the frost-thread on her loom.
1694𓀴And the bare trees talked together,
1695𓀴  Talked in whispers soft and low,
1696𓀴As the good and silent fairy
1697𓀴  Moved her shuttle to and fro.
1698𓀴
1699𓀴And lo! when the golden glory
1700𓀴  Of the morning crept abroad,
1701𓀴All the trees were clothed in grandeur,
1702𓀴  All the twiglets robed, and shod
1703𓀴With matchless, spotless garments,
1704𓀴  That the sunshine decked with gems,
1705𓀴And the trees forgot their sorrow,
1706𓀴  'Neath their robes and diadems.

1712𓀴
1713𓀴Did you see Florabelle? has she passed you this morning?
1714𓀴  A tall, slender Maiden, with hair like spun gold.
1715𓀴She has? then I pray you, dear sir, heed my warning,
1716𓀴  It is just the old, oft rehearsed story re-told:
1717𓀴
1718𓀴Florabelle is a jilt--a coquette--a deceiver.
1719𓀴  She angles for hearts, with soft words and sweet smiles.
1720𓀴Forewarned is forearmed, don't you trust or believe her,
1721𓀴  Be deaf to her cooing, be blind to her wiles.
1722𓀴
1723𓀴She has eyes, like the heart of a blue morning glory,
1724𓀴  She has lips like a rose-bud just sprinkled with dew,
1725𓀴'Tis the old hackneyed tale, 'tis the same wretched story,
1726𓀴  A woman all fair, yet all false, and untrue.
1727𓀴
1728𓀴With her soft silken hair, in its meshes and tangles,
1729𓀴  With her pink and white cheek, and her full ruby lips,
1730𓀴With her eyes shining clear, like the heaven's bright sparkles,
1731𓀴  She has wrecked as strong _hearts_ as the ocean has ships.
1732𓀴
1733𓀴Those blue eyes are ever on watch for a stranger;
1734𓀴  She thirsts for fresh conquests, and she has marked you,
1735𓀴I warn you, my friend, that your peace is in danger,
1736𓀴  Take heed, lest the day that you met her, you rue.
1737𓀴
1738𓀴Don't bask in her smiles, for one moment, but leave her,
1739𓀴  Before you're entangled, and find it too late.
1740𓀴Florabelle is a jilt--a coquet--a deceiver,
1741𓀴  I have given you warning! now choose your own fate!

1746𓀴_THE DOOMED CITY'S PRAYER_
1747𓀴
1748𓀴(After the Burning of Chicago.)
1749𓀴
1750𓀴I heard a low sound, like a troubled soul praying:
1751𓀴  And the winds of the winter night brought it to me.
1752𓀴 'Twas the doomed city's voice: "Oh, kind snow," it was saying,
1753𓀴  "Come, cover my ruins, so ghastly to see,
1754𓀴I am robbed of my beauty, and shorn of my glory;
1755𓀴  And the strength that I boasted--where is it to-day?
1756𓀴I am down in the dust; and my pitiful story
1757𓀴  Make tearless eyes weep, and unpious lips pray.
1758𓀴
1759𓀴"I--I, who have reveled in pomp and in power,
1760𓀴  Am down on my knees, with my face in the dust.
1761𓀴But yesterday queen, with a queen's royal dower,
1762𓀴  To-day I am glad of a crumb or a crust.
1763𓀴But yesterday reigning, a grand mighty city,
1764𓀴  The pride of the nation, the queen of the West;
1765𓀴To-day I am gazed at, an object of pity,
1766𓀴  A charity child, asking alms, at the best.
1767𓀴
1768𓀴"My strength, and my pride, and my glory departed,
1769𓀴  My fair features scorched by the fire fiend's breath,
1770𓀴Is it strange that I'm soul-sick and sorrowful hearted?
1771𓀴  Is it strange that my thoughts run on ruin and death?
1772𓀴Oh, white, fleecy clouds that are drooping above me,
1773𓀴  Hark, hark to my pleadings, and answer my sighs,
1774𓀴And let down the beautiful snow, if you love me,
1775𓀴  To cover my wounds from all pitying eyes.
1776𓀴
1777𓀴"I am hurled from my throne, but not hurled down forever,
1778𓀴  I shall rise from the dust; I shall live down my woes--
1779𓀴But my heart lies to-day, like a dumb, frozen river;
1780𓀴  When to thaw out and flow again, God only knows.
1781𓀴Oh, sprites of the air! I beseech you to weave me
1782𓀴  A mantle of white snow, and beautiful rime
1783𓀴To cover my unsightly ruins; then leave me
1784𓀴  In the hands of the healer of all wounds--'Old Time.'"

1817𓀴  Why shouldn't we, of lower station!"
1818𓀴
1819𓀴Oh, men! you see, you hear this beast,
1820𓀴  This fiend that pillages the earth.
1821𓀴Whose work is death--whose hourly feast,
1822𓀴  Is noble souls, and minds of worth--
1823𓀴You see--and if you will not chain him,
1824𓀴  Nor reach one hand forth, to detain him.
1825𓀴
1826𓀴For God's sake, do not give him aid,
1827𓀴  Nor urge him onward. Oh, to me,
1828𓀴It seems so strange that laws are made
1829𓀴  To crush all other crimes, while he
1830𓀴Who bears down through Hell's gaping portals
1831𓀴  The countless souls, of rum wrecked mortals,
1832𓀴
1833𓀴Is left to wander, to, and fro,
1834𓀴  In perfect freedom through the land.
1835𓀴And those who ought to see, and know,
1836𓀴  Will lift no warning voice, or hand.

1843𓀴_DECORATION POEM_
1844𓀴
1845𓀴Gather them out of the valley--
1846𓀴  Bring them from moorland and hill,
1847𓀴And cast them in wreaths and in garlands.
1848𓀴  On the city so silent and still--
1849𓀴  So voiceless, so silent, and still;
1850𓀴Where neighbor speaks never to neighbor,
1851𓀴  Where the song of the bird, and the brown bee is heard,
1852𓀴But never the harsh sounds of labor.
1853𓀴
1854𓀴Bring them from woodland and meadow--
1855𓀴  As fresh, and as fair, as can be.
1856𓀴Bring them, all kinds, and all colors.
1857𓀴  That grow upon upland and lea--
1858𓀴  That spring in wild grace on the lea.
1859𓀴And rifle the green earth's warm bosom
1860𓀴  Of each flower, and blow, till "God's acre" shall glow
1861𓀴And bloom, like a garden in blossom.
1862𓀴
1863𓀴Bring them from vase, and from hot-house,
1864𓀴  And strew them with bountiful hand.
1865𓀴There is nothing too rare for the soldier,
1866𓀴  Who laid down his life for his land--
1867𓀴  Who laid down _all things_ for his land;
1868𓀴And turned to the duty before him,
1869𓀴  And how now can we prove, our thanks and our love
1870𓀴But by casting these May blossoms o'er him.
1871𓀴
1872𓀴We know they will soon fade, and wither--
1873𓀴  We know they will soon droop, and die;
1874𓀴But one time, I read, how an angel
1875𓀴  Came down from the mansions on high--
1876𓀴  In the night, from God's kingdom on high--
1877𓀴Came down where a poor faded flower
1878𓀴  Lay crushed by rude feet, in the dust of the street,
1879𓀴And he carried it up to God's bower;
1880𓀴
1881𓀴And laid it before the Good Master,
1882𓀴  Who kissed it, and passed it to Christ,
1883𓀴On the throne at His side; and _He_ kissed it,
1884𓀴  And the touch of those kisses sufficed--
1885𓀴  The caress of the God-head sufficed--
1886𓀴And it bloomed out in wonderful splendor,
1887𓀴  A thing of delight, and most fair in God's sight--
1888𓀴'Tis a fable, I know; but so tender;
1889𓀴
1890𓀴So sweet that I like to believe it--
1891𓀴  And I have been thinking, to-day,
1892𓀴That mayhap these soldiers, now angels,
1893𓀴  Will come, when these wreathes fade away--
1894𓀴  When they wither, and shrivel away--
1895𓀴And will bear the crushed things up to heaven,
1896𓀴  And God, and His Son will kiss them, each one,
1897𓀴And new beauty, and bloom will be given.
1898𓀴
1899𓀴And odd fancy, perhaps, yet dispute it.
1900𓀴  And prove it untrue if you can.
1901𓀴There are strange, subtle ways, in God's workings
1902𓀴  Now veiled from the knowledge of man,
1903𓀴  Shut out from the vision of man.--
1904𓀴By a dark veil of deep, mortal blindness;
1905𓀴  But when God deems it right, He will give us our sight,
1906𓀴And remove the thick veil, in His kindness;
1907𓀴
1908𓀴And when we have entered His kingdom,
1909𓀴  And all his strange ways understand,
1910𓀴Who knows but these very same flowers,
1911𓀴  We shall find there abloom, in His land,
1912𓀴  All fresh, and all fair, in His land;
1913𓀴And these soldiers, who went on before us,
1914𓀴  As we wander and stray, through God's gardens, shall say:
1915𓀴"These are the wreathes you cast o'er us."
1916𓀴
1917𓀴Then, strew ye the best, and the brightest
1918𓀴  Of buds, and of blossoms full blown,
1919𓀴Over the graves, of the loved ones--
1920𓀴  Over those labelled "Unknown!"
1921𓀴  Oh! the pathos of that word, "Unknown!"
1922𓀴Bring hither the brightest, and rarest!
1923𓀴  We reck not, if the clay, wore the blue garb, or gray!
1924𓀴We will give them the best, and the fairest.
1925𓀴
1926𓀴For somebody mourned for the "missing,"
1927𓀴  And wept for them hot, scalding tears,
1928𓀴And hoped against hope, for their coming;
1929𓀴  And watched, and waited, months and years,
1930𓀴  Such long, and such desolate years!
1931𓀴But the hearts are _so_ patient, that love them.
1932𓀴  And some now watch and weep, for the soldiers who sleep
1933𓀴With the slab labeled "Unknown" above them.
1934𓀴
1935𓀴Then gather from meadow, and woodland,
1936𓀴  From garden, and hot-house, and vase,
1937𓀴The brightest and choicest of blossoms,
1938𓀴  And scatter them here in this place;
1939𓀴  This holy and hallowed place--
1940𓀴This city of rest, not of labor,
1941𓀴  Where only the bird, and th' brown bee is heard,
1942𓀴And neighbor, speaks never to neighbor.

1947𓀴_A BABY IN THE HOUSE_
1948𓀴
1949𓀴I knew that a baby was hid in that house,
1950𓀴  Though I saw no cradle, and heard no cry,
1951𓀴But the husband went tiptoeing 'round like a mouse,
1952𓀴  And the good wife was humming a soft lullaby;
1953𓀴And there was a look on the face of that mother
1954𓀴That I knew could mean only _one_ thing, and no other.
1955𓀴
1956𓀴"The _mother_," I said to myself; for I knew
1957𓀴  That the woman before me was certainly that,
1958𓀴For there lay in the corner a tiny cloth shoe,
1959𓀴  And I saw on a stand such a wee little hat;
1960𓀴And the beard of the husband said plain as could be,
1961𓀴"Two fat, chubby hands have been tugging at me."
1962𓀴
1963𓀴And he took from his pocket a gay picture book,
1964𓀴  And a dog that would bark if you pulled on a string;
1965𓀴And the wife laid them up with such a pleased look;
1966𓀴  And I said to myself, "There is no other thing
1967𓀴But a babe that could bring about all this, and so
1968𓀴That one is in hiding here somewhere, I know."
1969𓀴
1970𓀴I stayed but a moment, and saw nothing more,
1971𓀴  And heard not a sound, yet I knew I was right;
1972𓀴What else could the shoe mean that lay on the floor--
1973𓀴  The book and the toy, and the faces so bright?
1974𓀴And what made the husband as still as a mouse?
1975𓀴I am sure, _very_ sure, there's a babe in that house.

1981𓀴
1982𓀴[Read at the Reunion of the Society of the
1983𓀴"Grand Army of the Tennessee," at Madison, Wisconsin, July 4th, 1872.]
1984𓀴
1985𓀴After the battles are over,
1986𓀴  And the war drums cease to beat,
1987𓀴And no more is heard on the hillside
1988𓀴  The sound of hurrying feet,
1989𓀴Full many a noble action,
1990𓀴  That was done in the days of strife,
1991𓀴By the soldier is half forgotten,
1992𓀴  In the peaceful walks of life.
1993𓀴
1994𓀴Just as the tangled grasses,
1995𓀴  In summer's warmth and light,
1996𓀴Grow over the graves of the fallen
1997𓀴  And hide them away from sight,
1998𓀴So many an act of valor,
1999𓀴  And many a deed sublime,
2000𓀴Fades from the mind of the soldier,
2001𓀴  O'ergrown by the grass of time.
2002𓀴
2003𓀴Not so should they be rewarded,
2004𓀴  Those noble deeds of old;
2005𓀴They should live forever and ever,
2006𓀴  When the heroes' hearts are cold.
2007𓀴Then rally, ye brave old comrades,
2008𓀴  Old veterans, re-unite!
2009𓀴Up root time's tangled grasses--
2010𓀴  Live over the march, and the fight.
2011𓀴
2012𓀴Let Grant come up from the White House,
2013𓀴  And clasp each brother's hand,
2014𓀴First chieftain of the army,
2015𓀴  Last chieftain of the land.
2016𓀴Let him rest from a nation's burdens,
2017𓀴  And go, in thought, with his men,
2018𓀴Through the fire and smoke of Shiloh,
2019𓀴  And save the day again.
2020𓀴
2021𓀴This silent hero of battles,
2022𓀴  Knew no such word as _defeat_.
2023𓀴It was left for the rebels learning.
2024𓀴  Along with the word retreat.
2025𓀴He was not given to _talking_,
2026𓀴  But he found that guns would preach
2027𓀴In a way that was more convincing
2028𓀴  Than fine and flowery speech.
2029𓀴
2030𓀴Three cheers for the grave commander
2031𓀴  Of the grand old Tennessee!
2032𓀴Who won the first great battle--
2033𓀴  Gained the first great victory.
2034𓀴His motto was always "Conquer,"
2035𓀴  "Success" was his countersign,
2036𓀴And "though it took all summer,"
2037𓀴  He kept fighting upon "that line."
2038𓀴
2039𓀴Let Sherman, the stern old General,
2040𓀴  Respond to the reveille,
2041𓀴Let him march with his boys through Georgia,
2042𓀴  From "Atlanta down to the sea."
2043𓀴Oh, that grand old tramp to Savannah!
2044𓀴  Three hundred miles to the coast!
2045𓀴It will live in the heart of the Nation,
2046𓀴  Forever its pride and boast.
2047𓀴
2048𓀴As Sheridan went to the battle.
2049𓀴  When a score of miles away,
2050𓀴* He has come to the feast and banquet.
2051𓀴  By the iron horse to-day.
2052𓀴Its space is not much swifter
2053𓀴  Than the pace of that famous steed
2054𓀴That bore him down to the contest
2055𓀴  And saved the day by his speed.
2056𓀴
2057𓀴Then go over the ground to-day, boys,
2058𓀴  Tread each remembered spot.
2059𓀴It will be a gleesome journey,
2060𓀴  On the swift-shod feet of thought;
2061𓀴You can fight a bloodless battle,
2062𓀴  You can skirmish along the route,
2063𓀴But it's not worthwhile to forage,
2064𓀴  There are rations enough without.
2065𓀴
2066𓀴Don't start if you hear the cannon;
2067𓀴  It is not the sound of doom,
2068𓀴It does not call to the contest--
2069𓀴  To the battle's smoke and gloom.
2070𓀴"Let us have Peace," was spoken.
2071𓀴  And lo! peace ruled again;
2072𓀴And now the nation is shouting,
2073𓀴  Through the cannon's voice, "Amen."
2074𓀴
2075𓀴Oh, boys, who besieged old Vicksburg,
2076𓀴  Can time e'er wash away
2077𓀴The triumph of her surrender,
2078𓀴  Nine years ago to-day?
2079𓀴Can you ever forget the moment,
2080𓀴  When you saw that flag of white,
2081𓀴That told how the grim old city
2082𓀴  Had fallen in her might?
2083𓀴
2084𓀴Ah, 'twas a bold, brave army,
2085𓀴  When the boys with a right good will,
2086𓀴Went gayly marching and singing
2087𓀴  To the fight at Champion Hill.
2088𓀴They met with a warm reception,
2089𓀴  But the soul of "Old John Brown"
2090𓀴Was abroad on that field of battle,
2091𓀴  And our flag did NOT go down.
2092𓀴
2093𓀴Come, heroes of Look Out Mountain,
2094𓀴  Of Corinth and Donelson,
2095𓀴Of Kenesaw and Atlanta,
2096𓀴  And tell how the day was won!
2097𓀴Hush! bow the head for a moment--
2098𓀴  There are those who cannot come.
2099𓀴No bugle call can arouse them--
2100𓀴  No sound of fife, or drum.
2101𓀴
2102𓀴McPherson fell in the battle,
2103𓀴  When its waves were surging high.
2104𓀴Brave Ransom sank by the wayside;
2105𓀴  'Twas a lonely death to die.
2106𓀴They walk God's fair, green meadows,
2107𓀴  They dwell in a land of bliss,
2108𓀴Yet I think their spirits are with us
2109𓀴  In such an hour as this.
2110𓀴
2111𓀴Oh, boys who died for the country,
2112𓀴  Oh, dear and sainted dead!
2113𓀴What can we say about you
2114𓀴  That has not once been said?
2115𓀴Whether you fell in the contest,
2116𓀴  Struck down by shot and shell,
2117𓀴Or pined 'neath the hand of sickness,
2118𓀴  Or starved in the prison cell--
2119𓀴
2120𓀴We know that you died for Freedom,
2121𓀴  To save our land from shame,
2122𓀴To rescue a periled Nation,
2123𓀴  And we give you deathless fame.
2124𓀴'Twas the cause of Truth and Justice
2125𓀴  That you fought and perished for,
2126𓀴And we say it, oh, so gently,
2127𓀴  "Our boys who died in the war."
2128𓀴
2129𓀴Saviours of our Republic,
2130𓀴  Heroes who wore the blue,
2131𓀴We owe the peace that surrounds us--
2132𓀴  And our Nation's strength, to you.
2133𓀴We owe it to you that our banner,
2134𓀴  The fairest flag in the world
2135𓀴Is to-day unstained, unsullied,
2136𓀴  On the summer air unfurled.
2137𓀴
2138𓀴We look on its stripes and spangles,
2139𓀴  And our hearts are filled the while
2140𓀴With love for the brave commanders,
2141𓀴  And the boys of the rank and file.
2142𓀴The grandest deeds of valor,
2143𓀴  Were never written out,
2144𓀴The noblest acts of virtue,
2145𓀴  The world knows nothing about.
2146𓀴
2147𓀴And many a private soldier,
2148𓀴  Who walks his humble way,
2149𓀴With no sounding name or title,
2150𓀴  Unknown to the world to-day,
2151𓀴In the eyes of God is a hero;
2152𓀴  All such he will reward,
2153𓀴No deed however secret,
2154𓀴  Is hidden from the Lord.
2155𓀴
2156𓀴Brave men of a mighty army,
2157𓀴  We extend you friendships hand!
2158𓀴I speak for the "Loyal Women,"
2159𓀴  Those pillars of our land.
2160𓀴We wish you a hearty welcome,
2161𓀴  We are proud that you gather here
2162𓀴To talk of old times together
2163𓀴  On this brightest day in the year.
2164𓀴
2165𓀴And if peace, whose snow-white pinions,
2166𓀴  Brood over our land to-day,
2167𓀴Should ever again go from us,
2168𓀴  (God grant she may ever stay).
2169𓀴Should our Nation call in her peril
2170𓀴  For "Six hundred thousand more,"
2171𓀴The loyal women would hear her,
2172𓀴  And send you out as before.
2173𓀴
2174𓀴We would bring out the treasured knapsack.
2175𓀴  We would take the sword from the wall,
2176𓀴And hushing our own heart's pleadings,
2177𓀴  Hear only the country's call.
2178𓀴For next to our God, is our Nation:
2179𓀴  And we cherish the honored name,
2180𓀴Of the bravest of all brave armies
2181𓀴  Who fought for that Nation's fame.
2182𓀴
2183𓀴* This stanza was written after arriving at the hall, and
2184𓀴finding Sheridan among the Generals present, which may serve
2185𓀴as an explanation for the change of tense in that verse. Not
2186𓀴knowing that General Sheridan was a member of the Society,
2187𓀴no mention had been made of him when the poem was written.

2191𓀴
2192𓀴[A tribute to Ex-Governor Fairchild.]
2193𓀴
2194𓀴God bless the hero of my song!
2195𓀴  Six years the chieftain of our State!
2196𓀴We've held him, in our hearts, so long,
2197𓀴  And proved him good, and true, and great.
2198𓀴That now, we could not let him go,
2199𓀴Even if he would have it so.
2200𓀴
2201𓀴I hear the praises of his name
2202𓀴  From east and west, and north and south,
2203𓀴His foes are silenced from sheer shame:
2204𓀴  His deeds have silenced Slander's mouth,
2205𓀴And all the little imps of spite
2206𓀴He's crushed beneath the heel of Right.
2207𓀴
2208𓀴He dropped an arm one bloody day,
2209𓀴  In beating down the walls of wrong,
2210𓀴But no strength went with it away;
2211𓀴  His other grew full thrice as strong.
2212𓀴Few men, with their two hands, have done
2213𓀴As noble deeds as he with one.
2214𓀴
2215𓀴His soul speaks through his eye of blue,
2216𓀴  And all men know him one to trust,
2217𓀴Because his heart is kind and true,
2218𓀴  And all his actions prove him just.
2219𓀴I speak for thousands when I cry,
2220𓀴"The people's favorite for aye!"
2221𓀴
2222𓀴May God be with him all his days--
2223𓀴  With him and all he holds most dear;
2224𓀴And if my little song of praise
2225𓀴  Should chance to fall upon his ear,
2226𓀴May he accept the offering,
2227𓀴And know that from my heart I sing.

2232𓀴
2233𓀴Throughout these mellow autumn days,
2234𓀴All sweet and dim, and soft with haze,
2235𓀴I argue with my unwise heart,
2236𓀴That fain would choose the idler's part.
2237𓀴
2238𓀴My heart says, "Let us lie and dream
2239𓀴Under the sunshine's softened beam.
2240𓀴This is the dream-time of the year,
2241𓀴When Heaven itself seems bending near.
2242𓀴

2244𓀴And dream beneath the arching sky.

2249𓀴And cease to battle with the tide,
2250𓀴Let us, like Nature, rest and dream
2251𓀴And float with th' current of the stream."
2252𓀴
2253𓀴So pleads my heart. I answer "Nay,
2254𓀴Work waits for you and me to-day.
2255𓀴Behind these autumn hours of gold,
2256𓀴The winter lingers, bleak and cold.
2257𓀴
2258𓀴"And those who dream too long or much,
2259𓀴Must waken, shivering, at his touch,
2260𓀴With naught to show for vanished hours,
2261𓀴But dust of dreams and withered flowers.
2262𓀴
2263𓀴"So now, while days are soft and warm,
2264𓀴We must make ready for the storm."
2265𓀴Thus, through the golden, hazy weather,
2266𓀴My heart and I converse together.
2267𓀴
2268𓀴And yet, I dare not turn my eyes
2269𓀴To pebbly shores or tender skies,
2270𓀴Because I am so fain to do
2271𓀴E'en as my heart pleads with me to.

2276𓀴_LINES WRITTEN UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES BUELL_
2277𓀴
2278𓀴Something is missing from the balmy spring.
2279𓀴  There is no perfume in its gentle breath;
2280𓀴And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing,
2281𓀴  And all the bees chant of the grave and death.
2282𓀴Something is missing from the earth. One morn
2283𓀴  The angels called a new name on the roll;
2284𓀴A spirit soldier to their ranks was borne,
2285𓀴  And all Christ's army welcomed the pure young soul.
2286𓀴He died. Two little words, but only God
2287𓀴  Can understand the awful depths of woe
2288𓀴They hold for those who pass beneath the rod,
2289𓀴  Praying for strength, from Him who aimed the blow.
2290𓀴He died. The soldier who fought long and well,
2291𓀴  Who walked with Death upon the battle-field,
2292𓀴Among the bellowing guns--the shrieking shell--
2293𓀴  In poison prison dens--and would not yield.
2294𓀴
2295𓀴A six month three times told, he languished there,
2296𓀴  And yet he lived; oh, young heart, strong and brave!
2297𓀴Thank God, who heard the oft repeated prayer;
2298𓀴  Thank God, he does not fill a Southern grave;
2299𓀴That when he died, the loved ones gathered round,
2300𓀴  And eased the anguish of those last, sad hours.
2301𓀴That gentle hands can keep the precious mound
2302𓀴  All green with mosses, and abloom with flowers.
2303𓀴
2304𓀴He was so young and fair; and life was sweet.
2305𓀴  Christ give the mourners strength to drain the cup!
2306𓀴He went to make the Heavenly ranks complete,
2307𓀴  God sent the angel Death, to bear him up.
2308𓀴So young, and fair and brave; beloved by all;
2309𓀴  The lisping child--life's veteran, bent and gray--
2310𓀴And eyes grow dim, and bitter tear-drops fall
2311𓀴  Upon the mound where lies the soldier's clay.
2312𓀴
2313𓀴Oh! it is sweet to feel that God knows best,
2314𓀴  Who called in youth this brother, friend and son,
2315𓀴And sweet to lean upon the Saviour's breast,
2316𓀴  And looking upward, say, "Thy will be done."
2317𓀴But something is missing from the balmy spring;
2318𓀴  There is no perfume in its gentle breath,
2319𓀴And there are sobs in songs the wild birds sing,
2320𓀴  And all the bees chant of the grave, and death.
2321𓀴
2322𓀴
2323𓀴_UNDER THE WILLOW_
2324𓀴
2325𓀴Under the willow, you and I
2326𓀴Walked in the gloaming, when love ran high;
2327𓀴That wild first love, that was almost pain,
2328𓀴That we never on earth can know again.
2329𓀴
2330𓀴The winds were soft, and the night was calm;
2331𓀴You held my hand in your throbbing palm.
2332𓀴With the fire of passion your dark eyes glowed,
2333𓀴And the tide of my pulses madly flowed.
2334𓀴
2335𓀴You drew me closely against your side--
2336𓀴You asked me softly to be your bride.
2337𓀴I trembled, and flushed, and could not speak,
2338𓀴But you knew my answer, and kissed my cheek.
2339𓀴
2340𓀴"When earth has perished, and time is dead.
2341𓀴Our love will still live on," we said.
2342𓀴"It shall have a steady and quenchless ray,
2343𓀴Though youth and strength, and life decay."
2344𓀴
2345𓀴The night-bird warbled a song just then;
2346𓀴It sounded to us like a glad amen,
2347𓀴As we built our castles, and made our vows,
2348𓀴Under the willow's drooping boughs.
2349𓀴
2350𓀴  *  *  *  *  *
2351𓀴
2352𓀴Under the willows, to and fro
2353𓀴We walked in the gloaming, when love ran low.
2354𓀴The tide had ebbed, the current dried,
2355𓀴And our wild, mad passion had slowly died.
2356𓀴
2357𓀴I know not wherefore, but widely apart
2358𓀴We had steadily drifted, heart from heart.
2359𓀴Something invisible came between--
2360𓀴I know not what--it was fate, I ween.
2361𓀴
2362𓀴The scales had dropped from our youthful eyes,
2363𓀴And we viewed each other in strange surprise;
2364𓀴And she you deemed an angel before,
2365𓀴You found was a woman--and nothing more.
2366𓀴
2367𓀴And the idol I worshiped for gold, alway,
2368𓀴I found was the poorest kind of clay.
2369𓀴And so it perished, at one cold breath,
2370𓀴The passion we said would live through death.
2371𓀴
2372𓀴And under the willow again we strayed,
2373𓀴And sundered the vows that once were made.
2374𓀴We felt no sorrow--we knew no woe--
2375𓀴Since _love_ had perished, 'twere better so.
2376𓀴
2377𓀴We have dreamt our dream; we have reached the end.
2378𓀴You said so calmly, "farewell, my friend."
2379𓀴The night-bird uttered a wailing cry;
2380𓀴It sounded to me like a last good-bye.
2381𓀴
2382𓀴I am glad that we sundered our vows, that night.
2383𓀴My pathway is pleasant, my heart is light.
2384𓀴But I feel, my friend, as the days flow on,
2385𓀴That something of youth from my life is gone.
2386𓀴
2387𓀴And never, on earth, can we know again,
2388𓀴That first, mad passion, so near to pain,
2389𓀴When under the willow, you and I
2390𓀴Walked in the gloaming, and love ran high.
2391𓀴
2392𓀴
2393𓀴_DOUBTING_
2394𓀴
2395𓀴Sometimes we mortals, writhing in bitter anguish,
2396𓀴  Crushed by great griefs, that seem too hard to bear,
2397𓀴And led to doubt God's goodness and his wisdom,
2398𓀴  And will not lift our burdened hearts in prayer.
2399𓀴I think these moments are the very darkest,
2400𓀴  The blackest and the coldest that we know,
2401𓀴And I think God, and Christ, and all the angels,
2402𓀴  Pity us most, in this phase of our woe.
2403𓀴
2404𓀴I had a little child I fondly cherished;
2405𓀴  A winsome, playful, tender-hearted boy,
2406𓀴Strong willed, yet gentle, gay, yet mild and loving.
2407𓀴  He was our household idol and our joy.
2408𓀴We lavished on him stores of pure affection;
2409𓀴  We gave him the best love our hearts possessed,
2410𓀴We dressed him in rich robes of finest texture,
2411𓀴  And gazing on him, felt this earth life-blest.
2412𓀴
2413𓀴We taught him all things good, and true, and noble;
2414𓀴  We told him of the dear Lord crucified;
2415𓀴We planned for him a bright and happy future;
2416𓀴  We guarded him from danger--yet he died.
2417𓀴Not all the gold and riches we might lavish,
2418𓀴  Not all our gold could save him from the tomb.
2419𓀴He died! and when the sweet eyes closed forever,
2420𓀴  They shut the sunshine in, and left but gloom.
2421𓀴
2422𓀴To-day I saw a drunkard's child--a vagrant;
2423𓀴  Ill-clad, ill-fed, uncombed, unwashed, and wild;
2424𓀴His home the street--his lessons vice and sorrow--
2425𓀴  His garments rags--his youthful lips defiled
2426𓀴With rum, tobacco, lies and loud blaspheming;
2427𓀴  What can his future be, but one of crime?
2428𓀴And thinking of this, and of my boy who slumbered,
2429𓀴  My heart felt hard, just for a little time.
2430𓀴
2431𓀴It seemed so strange, that he, a homeless vagrant,
2432𓀴  Unloved, unloving, treading the road to sin,
2433𓀴That he was spared; and mine so fondly cherished--
2434𓀴  Mine so beloved, whose life seemed so twined in
2435𓀴And round our heart strings, that when he was taken,
2436𓀴  It left them torn and bleeding--he should die;
2437𓀴Ah me, it seemeth strange; and yet God's wisdom
2438𓀴  I can not doubt, nor must I question why.
2439𓀴
2440𓀴He, being all-wise, Father, King, Creator,
2441𓀴  It would be strange, if you, or I should know
2442𓀴All that He knows, or understand His wisdom,
2443𓀴  All things He does, or why He does them so.
2444𓀴Were all this plain, unto our mortal vision,
2445𓀴  There would be nothing new to learn above;
2446𓀴So, though the cross be great, and the prize hidden,
2447𓀴  I need not doubt His wisdom or His love.

2452𓀴_AT SUNSET_
2453𓀴
2454𓀴I sit at my cottage window,
2455𓀴  In the light of the sun's last rays,
2456𓀴And the hill-tops glow with splendor,
2457𓀴  And the west is all ablaze.
2458𓀴My room is flooded with glory,
2459𓀴  My soul, with a wild delight,
2460𓀴And my heart is filled with poems,
2461𓀴  That I can not speak, or write.
2462𓀴
2463𓀴O, darker, and deeper, and grander,
2464𓀴  The glory flames on high,
2465𓀴And I trace the walls of a city.
2466𓀴  In that beautiful western sky:
2467𓀴A city all gold and crimson--
2468𓀴  All purple and amber red;
2469𓀴And the streets are paved with crystal,
2470𓀴  Where the feet of angels tread.
2471𓀴
2472𓀴O, soulless pen and pencil.
2473𓀴  Thy efforts are weak and vain;
2474𓀴The pen of the poet falters.
2475𓀴  And his heart is full of pain:
2476𓀴And the artist drops his pencil,
2477𓀴  And weeps in mute despair,
2478𓀴For he cannot paint the glory
2479𓀴  That lies in the sunset there.
2480𓀴
2481𓀴But the city fadeth--fadeth;
2482𓀴  The glory turns to grey;
2483𓀴The golden lights are dying,
2484𓀴  And the splendor melts away.
2485𓀴And I know it was only the shadow
2486𓀴  Of the city built on high--
2487𓀴Only the poor, pale shadow,
2488𓀴  That I saw in the sunset sky.
2489𓀴
2490𓀴And I long for that other city--
2491𓀴  The city that God hath made,
2492𓀴Where the glory never paleth.
2493𓀴  And the splendors never fade.
2494𓀴O, there at the feet of Jesus,
2495𓀴  In anthems of praise, I know
2496𓀴My soul shall utter the poems
2497𓀴  That fill it to overflow.

2502𓀴_A TWILIGHT THOUGHT_
2503𓀴
2504𓀴The sweet maid, Day, has pillowed her head
2505𓀴  On the breast of her dusky lover Night;
2506𓀴The sun has made her a couch of red,
2507𓀴  And woven a cover of dim twilight;
2508𓀴And the lover kisses the maiden's brow,
2509𓀴As low on her couch she sleepeth now.
2510𓀴
2511𓀴Here at my window, above the street,
2512𓀴  I sit, as the day lies in repose;
2513𓀴And I list to the ceaseless tramp of feet.
2514𓀴  And I watch this human tide that flows,
2515𓀴Upward and downward, to and fro.
2516𓀴As the waves of an ocean, ebb and flow.
2517𓀴
2518𓀴Over and over the busy town,
2519𓀴  Hither and thither, through all the day;
2520𓀴One goes up, and another down--
2521𓀴  Each in his own allotted way.
2522𓀴Strangers and kinsmen pass and meet,
2523𓀴And jar, and jostle upon the street.
2524𓀴
2525𓀴People that never met before--
2526𓀴  People that never will meet again:
2527𓀴A careless glance of the eye--no more,
2528𓀴  And both are lost in the sea of men.
2529𓀴Strangers, divided by _miles_ in heart,
2530𓀴Under my window meet and part.
2531𓀴
2532𓀴But whether their feet pass up, or down,
2533𓀴  Over the river, east or west,
2534𓀴Whether it's in or out of the town,
2535𓀴  To a haunt of sin, or a home of rest,
2536𓀴We are journeying to a common goal--
2537𓀴There is one last point for every soul.
2538𓀴
2539𓀴Strangers and kinsmen, friend and foe,
2540𓀴  Whether their aims are great or small,
2541𓀴Whether their paths lie high, or low--
2542𓀴  There is one last resting place for all.
2543𓀴Then upward, and downward, go surging by--
2544𓀴Under my window--you _all_ must die.

2549𓀴_TRUE WARRIORS_
2550𓀴
2551𓀴Not always those who walk on steadily,
2552𓀴  In the straight path, where martyr's feet have trod,
2553𓀴Whose raiments seem of spotless purity,
2554𓀴  Not always are they most beloved of God.
2555𓀴Although he sees, and knows their righteousness,
2556𓀴  And from his throne, with loving eyes, looks down,
2557𓀴And hovers near, to comfort and to bless,
2558𓀴  And holds for each fair brow a starry crown--
2559𓀴
2560𓀴Yet there are those, who sometimes wander out
2561𓀴  Into forbidden paths of sin, and grief,
2562𓀴Who sometimes hover on the brink of doubt,
2563𓀴  Crying, "Oh, God, help thou mine unbelief!"
2564𓀴Whose lives are one long battle with their sins,
2565𓀴  Who long for righteousness, yet cling to earth;
2566𓀴And he who battles thus, and battling wins,
2567𓀴  God holds, and prizes, as of truer worth.
2568𓀴
2569𓀴For greater is he, fighting this good fight,
2570𓀴  Falling repeatedly, and prone to wrong,
2571𓀴Than he who walketh calmly in the light,
2572𓀴  And never falls, because he is so strong.
2573𓀴Who never sins, because sin tempts him not.
2574𓀴  To him who fights temptation one by one,
2575𓀴How sweet God's words when the last fight is fought,
2576𓀴  "Beloved servant, well, and nobly done."

2582𓀴
2583𓀴Some have robes, of silk and velvet,
2584𓀴  Cast like manna, down;
2585𓀴Others toil through wind and weather,
2586𓀴  For a homespun gown.
2587𓀴Some are born to ride in coaches,
2588𓀴  Sitting at their ease;
2589𓀴Others plod foot-sore and weary.
2590𓀴  (I am one of these.)
2591𓀴
2592𓀴Some have sounding name and title,
2593𓀴  Here upon the earth;
2594𓀴Others dwell apart from glory--
2595𓀴  No one knows their worth.
2596𓀴Some have wealth, and fame, and beauty,
2597𓀴  All the things that please;
2598𓀴Some are poor, and plain and lonely.
2599𓀴  (I am one of these.)
2600𓀴
2601𓀴Some complain, in midst of pleasures,
2602𓀴  Of a hard, sad lot,
2603𓀴Doubting God, denying heaven,
2604𓀴  Loving, trusting not.
2605𓀴Others, hedged about with sorrows,
2606𓀴  Do, on bended knees,
2607𓀴Praise and bless the Lord forever.

2611𓀴_A FANCY_
2612𓀴
2613𓀴Drop down the crimson curtains,
2614𓀴  And shut out the dazzling snow,
2615𓀴The cold white mantle that covers
2616𓀴  The hills, where the grasses should grow;
2617𓀴And stir up the fire till it burneth,
2618𓀴  With a heat like the midsummer sun.
2619𓀴And hang up the cage by the window,
2620𓀴  And bring in the plants, one by one.
2621𓀴
2622𓀴Till they perfume the air with a fragrance
2623𓀴  As rare as the summer can bring.
2624𓀴And call to the bird, till he trilleth
2625𓀴  The sweetest of notes he can sing.
2626𓀴And let me lie here, while you fan me,
2627𓀴  Till the lazy air stirs, like a breeze.
2628𓀴That comes o'er the hills in the summer,
2629𓀴  And rustles the tops of the trees.
2630𓀴
2631𓀴Then sing me a song of the summer,
2632𓀴  A song full of warmth and sunlight,
2633𓀴And I will forget that the winter
2634𓀴  Stalks over the earth in his might.
2635𓀴I will dream that I lie in the clover,
2636𓀴  And your voice is the voice of the breeze,
2637𓀴And the bird in the cage is the robin,
2638𓀴  That sends down his song from the trees.

2646𓀴      So weary, Lord,
2647𓀴Of this long, ceaseless work of doing well,
2648𓀴      Without reward.
2649𓀴
2650𓀴Oh, I have been thy servant now for years,
2651𓀴      Nor made complaint,
2652𓀴Though my life cup has been abrim with tears,
2653𓀴      But now I faint.
2654𓀴
2655𓀴And I have worked for thee, with all my strength,
2656𓀴      In pain and woe.
2657𓀴My Master, canst thou chide me, if at length
2658𓀴      I ask to go?
2659𓀴
2660𓀴Oh, if the soul is purified by fire,
2661𓀴      Then I am blest.
2662𓀴The laborer is worthy of his hire--
2663𓀴      Lord, give me rest.
2664𓀴
2665𓀴I know that I have sinned in many ways--
2666𓀴      A sinner made.
2667𓀴But I have _tried_ to serve thee all my days--
2668𓀴      I'm not afraid.
2669𓀴
2670𓀴I know full well my record is not clear,

2680𓀴And soft south winds have melted all the snow,
2681𓀴  Then I shall meet my darling face to face;
2682𓀴And I shall clasp, and hold her hand in mine,
2683𓀴And I shall see her blue eyes glow and shine.
2684𓀴
2685𓀴And now the grass is green on moor and lea;
2686𓀴  The snow has vanished, and the spring is here,
2687𓀴The robins shout from every forest tree,
2688𓀴  The meadow larks are singing loud and clear,
2689𓀴And there are flowers abloom in every place--
2690𓀴And yet I do not see my darling's face.
2691𓀴
2692𓀴All soft and mild, the gentle south wind blew,
2693𓀴  The snow clouds vanished, and the sunshine fell
2694𓀴Upon the meadow, and the daisies grew,
2695𓀴  And violets and pansies graced the dell.
2696𓀴The bees are busy, while they softly hum,
2697𓀴And yet--and yet--my darling does not come.
2698𓀴
2699𓀴Alas! for never will she come again,
2700𓀴  She sleepeth, sleepeth, still and silent now;
2701𓀴Her couch is hollowed from the grassy plain,
2702𓀴  And daisies bloom and blow above her brow;
2703𓀴And I can never hold her hand in mine,
2704𓀴And I can never see her blue eyes shine.

2709𓀴_TRUE LOVE_
2710𓀴
2711𓀴I think true love is something like a tree;
2712𓀴  The oak, that lifts its branches to the sky.
2713𓀴The woodman's axe may strike it fatally,
2714𓀴  Or it may fall, when mighty winds sweep by.
2715𓀴And where it grew, the flowers may bloom instead,
2716𓀴And all may seem as though the tree were dead.
2717𓀴
2718𓀴But underneath the grass, and flowers, there lies,
2719𓀴  Hid from the gaping world, a tiny root,
2720𓀴A little living germ, that never dies;
2721𓀴  And ever and anon its branches shoot
2722𓀴Up through the earth, and mock, and strive to be
2723𓀴The mighty forest king--the parent tree.
2724𓀴
2725𓀴So love may wither, at the hand of Fate,
2726𓀴  Or fall beneath the killing winds that blow;
2727𓀴And other loves may spring up, soon or late,
2728𓀴  And flowers of forgetfulness may grow,
2729𓀴Over the spot where love once grew instead,
2730𓀴And we may think the old-time passion dead.
2731𓀴
2732𓀴And still the little germ lies in the heart,
2733𓀴  So closely hidden that it is not known;
2734𓀴And ever and anon its branches start--
2735𓀴  Vain mimics of the passion that has flown.
2736𓀴Though love, once slain, can live not, as of yore,
2737𓀴I think its ghost will haunt us evermore.

2742𓀴_HIS SONG_
2743𓀴
2744𓀴A poet wandered the city street,
2745𓀴With tattered garments, and aching feet;
2746𓀴Want and hunger had dimmed his eye,
2747𓀴And the children jeered him, as he passed by.
2748𓀴
2749𓀴But one of the children sang, at play,
2750𓀴A song his mother had sung that day.
2751𓀴The poet listened, with cheeks aflame,
2752𓀴For the song was his own, and this was fame!
2753𓀴
2754𓀴But his heart was lightened. The song of the boy
2755𓀴Had thrilled the strings, with a strange, sweet joy.
2756𓀴"Though I may lie with the nameless dead,
2757𓀴The songs I have written will live," he said.

2762𓀴_WHEN YOU GO AWAY_
2763𓀴
2764𓀴When you go away, my friend,
2765𓀴  When we say our last good-bye,
2766𓀴Then the summer time will end,
2767𓀴  And the winter will be nigh.
2768𓀴Though the green grass decks the heather,
2769𓀴  And the birds sing all the day,
2770𓀴There will be no summer weather,
2771𓀴  After you have gone away.
2772𓀴
2773𓀴When I look into your eyes,
2774𓀴  I shall thrill with sharpest pain;
2775𓀴Thinking that beneath the skies,
2776𓀴  I may never look again.
2777𓀴You will feel a moment's sorrow--
2778𓀴  I shall feel a lasting grief;
2779𓀴You forgetting on the morrow--
2780𓀴  I, to mourn with no relief
2781𓀴
2782𓀴When we say the last, sad words,
2783𓀴  And you are no longer near,
2784𓀴All the winds, and all the birds,
2785𓀴  Can not keep the summer here.
2786𓀴Life will lose its full completeness,
2787𓀴  Lose it, not for you, but me;
2788𓀴All the beauty and the sweetness
2789𓀴  Earth can hold, I shall not see.

2794𓀴_BLEAK WEATHER_
2795𓀴
2796𓀴Dear love, where the red lilies blossomed and grew,
2797𓀴      The white snows are falling;
2798𓀴And all through the wood, where I wandered with you,
2799𓀴      The loud winds are calling;
2800𓀴And the robin that piped to us tune upon tune,
2801𓀴      Neath the elm--you remember,
2802𓀴Over tree-top and mountain has followed the June,
2803𓀴      And left us--December.
2804𓀴
2805𓀴Has left, like a friend that is true in the sun,
2806𓀴      And false in the shadows.
2807𓀴He has found new delights, in the land where he's gone,
2808𓀴      Greener woodlands and meadows.
2809𓀴What care we? let him go! let the snow shroud the lea,
2810𓀴      Let it drift on the heather!
2811𓀴We can sing through it all; I have you--you have me,
2812𓀴      And we'll laugh at the weather.
2813𓀴
2814𓀴The old year may die, and a new one be born
2815𓀴      That is bleaker and colder;
2816𓀴But it cannot dismay us; we dare it--we scorn,
2817𓀴      For love makes us bolder.
2818𓀴Ah Robin! sing loud on the far-distant lea,
2819𓀴      Thou friend in fair weather;
2820𓀴But here is a song sung, that's fuller of glee,
2821𓀴      By two warm hearts together.

2826𓀴_THE TALE THE ROBIN TOLD_
2827𓀴
2828𓀴I walked to-day, in the grassy dell,
2829𓀴  Where the cunning ground-bird hides her nest,
2830𓀴And just where the plum-tree's shadow fell,
2831𓀴  I sat me down for a while to rest.
2832𓀴And a robin came, and sat in the tree,
2833𓀴And told a long-lost tale to me.
2834𓀴
2835𓀴Of a maiden, pure as the morning light,
2836𓀴  And fresh as a white rose, bathed in dew.
2837𓀴Of a youth with eyes like a stormy night,
2838𓀴  And a heart that nothing of candor knew.
2839𓀴And all through the valley, green and fair,
2840𓀴The youth and the maiden wandered there.
2841𓀴
2842𓀴He plucked the violets, blue and pale,
2843𓀴  The lily white, and the roses red,
2844𓀴With every flower that decked the vale--
2845𓀴  But the maid was fairest of all, he said.
2846𓀴And the robin saw him kiss her cheek,
2847𓀴And the maiden blushed, but did not speak.
2848𓀴
2849𓀴And he held her hand, in a lover's way,
2850𓀴  And he saw the blush that his glance awoke,
2851𓀴And with eye, and tone, he seemed to say
2852𓀴  The words that his false lips never spoke.
2853𓀴And of her strength, and her life a part,
2854𓀴Was the love that grew in the maiden's heart.
2855𓀴
2856𓀴But the summer died, and the autumn came,
2857𓀴  And the maiden walked in the vale alone;
2858𓀴And the hopeless love, like a scorching flame,
2859𓀴  Burned out her life, but she made no moan.
2860𓀴And she drooped, and died, as the year grew old,
2861𓀴And this was the tale that the robin told.
2862𓀴
2863𓀴
2864𓀴_A MEMORY_
2865𓀴
2866𓀴Oh, do you remember that night, long ago,
2867𓀴  When I gave you the rose from my hair?
2868𓀴And you whispered, "I'll wear it close over my heart,
2869𓀴  As I cherish the sweet giver there?"
2870𓀴
2871𓀴'Twas a long time ago? you've forgotten, perhaps,
2872𓀴  That such a thing ever occurred.
2873𓀴But to-night, as I sit in the firelight's glow,
2874𓀴  My heart's with the memory stirred.
2875𓀴
2876𓀴And I seem to live over my girlhood again,
2877𓀴  When my life was as warm as the spring:
2878𓀴Before it had read the sharp lesson of pain,
2879𓀴  And when you were my hero, arid king.
2880𓀴
2881𓀴Oh! you were not worthy the love that I gave,
2882𓀴  Like the sun in midsummer, it burned;
2883𓀴While a passionless fancy, an idle day-dream,
2884𓀴  Was the poor, shallow thing you returned.
2885𓀴
2886𓀴Long ago--long ago! time has softened the pain,
2887𓀴  That threatened to shadow my life.
2888𓀴I am older, and wiser I think, now, than then,
2889𓀴  And you have a beautiful wife--
2890𓀴
2891𓀴As pure as the angels, as fair, too, they say,
2892𓀴  With her blue eyes and snowy-white lid.
2893𓀴But I cannot help wondering, here to myself,
2894𓀴  If she loves you as well as I did.
2895𓀴
2896𓀴Ah me! it can never harm you, or your bride,
2897𓀴  For me to dream over that night,
2898𓀴When you whispered sweet words o'er the rose from my hair.
2899𓀴  And my foolish heart throbbed in delight.

2904𓀴_WAITING_
2905𓀴
2906𓀴      The days flow on, and on,
2907𓀴      And never one comes back.
2908𓀴Another year has vanished and gone,
2909𓀴As the waves of the sea wash out the track
2910𓀴    On the shining sands o' th' shore.
2911𓀴And patience waneth, and hope is spent,
2912𓀴As I wait and watch for the one who went,
2913𓀴    And cometh to me no more.
2914𓀴
2915𓀴      The spring-time lived and died,
2916𓀴      And the summer followed fast;
2917𓀴And I watched through both, with a heart that cried,
2918𓀴For the one who vanished into the past,
2919𓀴    Like a beautiful star from the sky;
2920𓀴Who sailed in a good ship over the sea,
2921𓀴And the ship came back:  But "where is he,
2922𓀴    Oh, treacherous ship," I cry?
2923𓀴
2924𓀴      The autumn, gold and brown,
2925𓀴      Rose from the summer's grave,
2926𓀴And the rain and my tears fell down and down,
2927𓀴As day by day, I stood by the wave.
2928𓀴    And cried aloud in my pain.
2929𓀴But what cares the sea for a tortured soul!
2930𓀴It mocks at grief, and the breakers roll,
2931𓀴    Singing a loud refrain.
2932𓀴
2933𓀴      And never a word from thee,
2934𓀴      But a silence deep as death;
2935𓀴Though the winter gleameth on moor and lea,
2936𓀴And the cold, cold wind, with its cruel breath,
2937𓀴    Blows over the angry sea.
2938𓀴Yet alway and ever, till life is done,
2939𓀴Shall I watch, and wait, and weep for one
2940𓀴    Who cometh never, to me.

2945𓀴_DRIFTING APART_
2946𓀴
2947𓀴Farther apart, each day, our lives are drifting;
2948𓀴  Farther apart at every set of sun.
2949𓀴The clouds between us show no signs of lifting,
2950𓀴  But droop, and gather shadows, one by one.
2951𓀴
2952𓀴Drifting apart! the visions that I've cherished,
2953𓀴  Within my loving, foolish heart for years,
2954𓀴At those two meaning words, have rudely perished,
2955𓀴  And in their place is naught but bitter tears.
2956𓀴
2957𓀴I do not weep--I do not sigh, and languish,
2958𓀴  And murmur at the hard decree of fate.
2959𓀴I walk my way, in silent, smiling anguish,
2960𓀴  Knowing remorse, and tears, are all too late.
2961𓀴
2962𓀴But oh, my darling! I am only human,
2963𓀴  And though 'tis weakness, I do love you yet.
2964𓀴Mine is the heart, of clinging, constant woman,
2965𓀴  Whose lot it is to love, and not forget.
2966𓀴
2967𓀴I know that we can never stem the current,
2968𓀴  That bore the sunshine of my life away;
2969𓀴Our feet can never cross the unbridged torrent
2970𓀴  That flows between us, wider every day.
2971𓀴
2972𓀴Perhaps, when we have passed the heavenly portal,
2973𓀴  And all our tears are dried by Christ, the Friend,
2974𓀴And we have entered on the life immortal,
2975𓀴  Perhaps our path ways There may meet, and blend.
2976𓀴
2977𓀴I cannot tell; the mystic, grand To-morrow
2978𓀴  Was never meant for earthly, mortal eyes.
2979𓀴But it is sweet, to think all tears and sorrow,
2980𓀴  Will vanish at the dawn of heavenly skies.

2990𓀴    And what starts the tears,
2991𓀴Like the warm kiss that is given at meeting
2992𓀴    After long years.
2993𓀴
2994𓀴Friend of my heart, we are once more together;
2995𓀴    Hand clasped in hand.
2996𓀴We sit and we walk in the beautiful weather
2997𓀴    That gladdens the land.
2998𓀴
2999𓀴Oh, rare golden days, in the heart of September;
3000𓀴    Days more than sweet--
3001𓀴Days that my heart will forever remember,
3002𓀴    Ye are too fleet!
3003𓀴
3004𓀴Why haste away! the greedy "Past's" measure
3005𓀴    Already runs o'er;
3006𓀴But like a miser who hoards up rare treasure,
3007𓀴    He cries out for "more."
3008𓀴
3009𓀴Oh, bright Autumn days! If you only would linger
3010𓀴    And loiter, and stay!
3011𓀴Too soon old time shall be pointing his finger
3012𓀴    And bidding me say.
3013𓀴
3014𓀴That word "Good-bye," that's so hard to be spoken.
3015𓀴    Hearts have been stirred
3016𓀴Almost to breaking; and fond hearts _have_ broken
3017𓀴    At that last word.
3018𓀴
3019𓀴Away with these sad thoughts! this rare golden weather
3020𓀴    Shall not find me sad,
3021𓀴Because we cannot _always_ wander together,
3022𓀴    But I will be glad
3023𓀴
3024𓀴Of the days that are left. No foreboding of sorrow
3025𓀴    Shall darken my sky.
3026𓀴Nor To-day be o'erclouded, because some To-morrow,
3027𓀴    I must say good-bye.

3033𓀴
3034𓀴Once in a while, in this world so strange,
3035𓀴To lighten our sad regrets,
3036𓀴We find a heart that is true through change--
3037𓀴  A heart that never forgets.
3038𓀴Oh, rare as a blossoming rose in December--
3039𓀴  As a bird in an Arctic clime,
3040𓀴Is a heart, a _heart_ that can remember
3041𓀴  Through sorrow and change and time.
3042𓀴
3043𓀴Once in a while we find a love
3044𓀴  That will live through life and death,
3045𓀴Ay! that will follow the soul above.
3046𓀴  Not passing away with the breath.
3047𓀴But rarer, Oh, rarer by far and stranger
3048𓀴  Than a spring in the desert sand,
3049𓀴Is a love that will last, with toil, and danger,
3050𓀴  And strife on every hand.
3051𓀴
3052𓀴Once in a while we find a friend
3053𓀴  That will cling through good or ill,
3054𓀴Whose friendship follows us e'en to the end,
3055𓀴  Be it up or adown the hill,
3056𓀴But the heart so true, and the love so tender,
3057𓀴  And friendship's faithful smile,
3058𓀴Whether we dwell in squalor or splendor,
3059𓀴  We find but "once in a while."

3065𓀴
3066𓀴Though thy cheek be fair, as the roses are,
3067𓀴  Thy brow like the drifted snow,
3068𓀴And thine eye as bright, as the diamonds light,
3069𓀴  Yet if in thy heart doth grow
3070𓀴But noxious weeds, and selfish deeds
3071𓀴  Follow thy steps alway,
3072𓀴What in the end availeth it, friend,
3073𓀴  If thy face is fair, I pray.
3074𓀴
3075𓀴For the smoothest brow, old Time will plow,
3076𓀴  And he dimmeth the brightest eye;
3077𓀴And the fairest face, and the form of grace,
3078𓀴  In the lowly grave must lie.
3079𓀴But our deeds live on, when life is done.
3080𓀴  Nor Time, nor death destroy;
3081𓀴And the words we say, will make their way
3082𓀴  With sorrow, or with joy.
3083𓀴
3084𓀴And even the thought, that we utter not,
3085𓀴  In heaven is like a shout.
3086𓀴And bad or good, it is understood,
3087𓀴  And the angels write it out
3088𓀴But they do not care, if the face be fair,
3089𓀴  Or what the world deems plain.
3090𓀴They look to the heart, and the deathless part,
3091𓀴  For the rest is poor and vain.

3102𓀴She has been my faithful friend,
3103𓀴  True and constant to the end.
3104𓀴
3105𓀴Since I saw her hand first beckon
3106𓀴  Far above my lowly plain,
3107𓀴I have had no need to reckon
3108𓀴  What my loss, or what my gain.
3109𓀴She has made sweet blossoms blow
3110𓀴  In whatever path I go;
3111𓀴She hath made the dark ways light.
3112𓀴  Made the somber places bright;
3113𓀴She has filled my empty cup
3114𓀴  Full to overflow with pleasure,
3115𓀴And, though I may drink it up,
3116𓀴  She again refills the measure.
3117𓀴
3118𓀴She has never promised aught
3119𓀴  That she has not more than brought.
3120𓀴She has stood by me in danger,
3121𓀴  Made a friend of many a stranger--
3122𓀴Made a welcome warm for me
3123𓀴  Whereso'er my lot may be;
3124𓀴Thrown wide open many a door
3125𓀴  That was closed to me before;
3126𓀴Given me every boon and blessing--
3127𓀴  Almost--that is worth possessing.
3128𓀴
3129𓀴All my life, I never knew
3130𓀴  Any other friend so true.
3131𓀴Youth and Love are fleeting things;
3132𓀴  Wealth has light and airy wings--
3133𓀴Fame, once mine, will never flee,
3134𓀴  She has been a friend to me.
3135𓀴Let who will condemn her ways,
3136𓀴  I shall always sing her praise.

3141𓀴_SOMEWHERE_
3142𓀴
3143𓀴Somewhere there is a spot of ground,
3144𓀴  Covered with grass, or snow, may-be,
3145𓀴That one day will be spaded 'round
3146𓀴  And dug up to make room for me.
3147𓀴
3148𓀴And I unconsciously have trod,
3149𓀴  Perhaps, and so again may tread
3150𓀴Upon the very voiceless sod,
3151𓀴  That will be roof above my head.
3152𓀴
3153𓀴Somewhere upon the earth to-day
3154𓀴  Are dwelling men, who yet shall spade
3155𓀴And cut and dig the earth away,
3156𓀴  Until my narrow house is made.
3157𓀴
3158𓀴Perchance they have clasped hands with me;
3159𓀴  Those hands, that, after I am dead,
3160𓀴Shall measure me so reverently,
3161𓀴  To find how long to make my bed.
3162𓀴
3163𓀴How strangely, solemn thoughts like these
3164𓀴  Will come, when life seems blithe and gay;
3165𓀴Like voices of the passing breeze,
3166𓀴  Saying "All things must pass away-"

3169𓀴_OUR ANGEL_
3170𓀴
3171𓀴Upon a couch all robed by careful hands
3172𓀴  For her repose, the maiden Mable lies,
3173𓀴Her long bright hair is braided in smooth bands--
3174𓀴  A mass of stranded gold, that mortal eyes
3175𓀴May, wondering, gaze upon a little while;
3176𓀴  That mortal hands may touch a few times more.
3177𓀴
3178𓀴Her placid lips part in a sweet, faint smile,
3179𓀴  As if the glories of that mystic shore,
3180𓀴When first they fell upon her spirit eyes--
3181𓀴  All the rare splendors of that unseen way
3182𓀴Had touched her with a wondering, glad surprise,
3183𓀴  And left the pleased expression on her clay.
3184𓀴
3185𓀴Her two fair hands are crossed upon her breast--
3186𓀴  Two shapes of wax upon a drift of snow.
3187𓀴And they have robed her for her peaceful rest.
3188𓀴  Not in the hateful shroud--that sign of woe,
3189𓀴But in that garb we loved to see her wear;
3190𓀴  A dark blue robe, fashioned by her own hand.
3191𓀴
3192𓀴I wonder, as I see her lying there,
3193𓀴  If God will give her spirit in His land
3194𓀴Another shape. She could not be more fair.
3195𓀴  I think he will not change her form, or face,
3196𓀴But with the same long, rippling, golden hair
3197𓀴  She will kneel down before the throne of grace,
3198𓀴And wipe God's feet; and her dark eyes will raise
3199𓀴  Up to Christ's face, and touch Him with her hand.
3200𓀴And will with her own sweet voice, sing God's praise,
3201𓀴  And still be fairest in the Angel band.

3206𓀴_A SUMMER IDYL_
3207𓀴
3208𓀴I hear the sound of the reapers,
3209𓀴  All in the golden grain,
3210𓀴And voices of strong young binders,
3211𓀴  Singing a sweet refrain.
3212𓀴The winds are asleep on the hilltops,
3213𓀴  And the sun smiles down in the vale,
3214𓀴Till the rose faints under his glances,
3215𓀴  And her cheek grows wan and pale.
3216𓀴
3217𓀴The meadows are green as the ocean;
3218𓀴  And the winds, when they wake from rest,
3219𓀴Ripple and billow the grasses,
3220𓀴  Like waves on the ocean's breast.
3221𓀴The vine grows over my window,
3222𓀴  Where the humming bird comes each day,
3223𓀴And the robin and thrush in the willow,
3224𓀴  Are singing their lives away.
3225𓀴
3226𓀴Oh, beautiful, languid Summer!
3227𓀴  You are so fleet, so fleet.
3228𓀴Oh, youth, and joy, and gladness,
3229𓀴  You are so sweet--so sweet!
3230𓀴My life is a wonderful poem,
3231𓀴  Complete in measure and rhyme,
3232𓀴And the sweetest of all the stanzas
3233𓀴  Is written this summer time.
3234𓀴
3235𓀴But the golden harvest is going--
3236𓀴  The summer will fade and pass.
3237𓀴The thrush and the robin will vanish,
3238𓀴  And the snow fall over the grass.
3239𓀴The vine at my window will perish.
3240𓀴  And the beautiful poem of life
3241𓀴Will change to a measure of sorrow,
3242𓀴  And be marred and broken by strife.
3243𓀴Then revel in youth, and summer;
3244𓀴  Oh, heart, be glad and gay,
3245𓀴For sorrow, and blight, and winter,
3246𓀴  Are coming to us one day.

3251𓀴_THE MUSICIANS_
3252𓀴
3253𓀴The strings of my heart were strung by Pleasure,
3254𓀴  And I laughed, when the music fell on my ear,
3255𓀴For he and Mirth played a joyful measure,
3256𓀴  And they played so loud that I could not hear
3257𓀴The wailing and moaning of souls a-weary--
3258𓀴  The strains of sorrow that floated around,
3259𓀴For my heart's notes rang loud and cheery,
3260𓀴  And I heard no other sound.
3261𓀴
3262𓀴Mirth and Pleasure, the music brothers,
3263𓀴  Played louder and louder in joyful glee;
3264𓀴But sometimes a discord was heard by others--
3265𓀴  Though only the rhythm was heard by me.
3266𓀴Louder and louder, and faster and faster
3267𓀴  The hands of the brothers played strain on strain,
3268𓀴When all of a sudden, a Mighty Master
3269𓀴  Swept them aside; and Pain,
3270𓀴Pain, the musician, the soul-refiner,
3271𓀴  Restrung the strings of my quivering heart,
3272𓀴And the air that he played was a plaintive minor,
3273𓀴  So sad that the tear-drops were forced to start;
3274𓀴Each note was an echo of awful anguish,
3275𓀴  As shrill as solemn, as sharp as slow,
3276𓀴And my soul for a season seemed to languish
3277𓀴  And faint with its weight of woe.
3278𓀴
3279𓀴With skillful hands, that were never weary,
3280𓀴  This Master of Music played strain on strain,
3281𓀴And between the bars of the miserere,
3282𓀴  He drew up the strings of my heart again:
3283𓀴And I was filled with a vague, strange wonder,
3284𓀴  To see that they did not snap in two.
3285𓀴
3286𓀴"They are drawn so tight they will break asunder,"
3287𓀴  I thought, but instead, they grew,
3288𓀴In the hands of the Master, firmer and stronger;
3289𓀴  And I could hear on the stilly air--
3290𓀴Now my ears were deafened by Mirth no longer--
3291𓀴  The sounds of sorrow, and grief, and despair,
3292𓀴And my soul grew tender and kind to others;
3293𓀴  My nature grew sweeter, my mind grew broad;
3294𓀴And I held all men to be my brothers,
3295𓀴  Linked by the chastening rod.
3296𓀴
3297𓀴My soul was lifted to God and heaven,
3298𓀴  And when on my heart-strings fell again
3299𓀴The hands of Mirth and Pleasure, even,
3300𓀴  There was never a discord to mar the strain.
3301𓀴For Pain, the musician, the soul-refiner,
3302𓀴  Attuned the strings with a Master hand,
3303𓀴And whether the music be major or minor,
3304𓀴  It is always sweet and grand.

3309𓀴_IN VAIN_
3310𓀴
3311𓀴The artist looks down on his canvass,
3312𓀴  And smothers a heart-weary sigh,
3313𓀴And he sees not the beautiful picture
3314𓀴  That glows with the hues of the sky.
3315𓀴For a picture that cannot be painted
3316𓀴  Burns into the artist's brain,
3317𓀴And he weeps as he sits at his easel,
3318𓀴  And sobs through his sorrow, "In vain."
3319𓀴
3320𓀴The poet reads over his poem,
3321𓀴  The thoughts of a Heaven-lent soul--
3322𓀴And sweet as the ripple of waters
3323𓀴  The beautiful sentences roll.
3324𓀴But a poem that cannot be written,
3325𓀴  Burns into the poet's brain,
3326𓀴And he weeps in a passion of anguish,
3327𓀴  And sobs through his sorrow, "In vain."
3328𓀴
3329𓀴The musician sits at his organ,
3330𓀴  And the air echoes sweet melodies.
3331𓀴But his heart cries for sounds that are better
3332𓀴  Than the sounds that he draws from the keys.
3333𓀴For a chord that has never been sounded--
3334𓀴  A passionate,--ecstatic strain.
3335𓀴And he weeps as he sits at the organ,
3336𓀴  And sobs through his sorrow, "In vain."
3337𓀴
3338𓀴Oh, Artist, Musician and Poet!
3339𓀴  Three souls that were lent to the earth
3340𓀴To brighten with fingers of beauty
3341𓀴  This bare, barren planet of dearth!
3342𓀴You dream of the glories of Heaven,
3343𓀴  And vainly are striving to show
3344𓀴To the gaze of the clay-fettered mortals,
3345𓀴  The things that no mortal shall know.

3350𓀴_BABY EVA_
3351𓀴
3352𓀴[Lines to the sweetest little girl in the world.]
3353𓀴
3354𓀴Sitting and watching the fire-light fall
3355𓀴In fitful gleams, on floor, and wall,
3356𓀴I think of the fairest of baby-girls,
3357𓀴With bright blue eyes, and sunny curls,
3358𓀴With two round cheeks, and a dimpled hand--
3359𓀴The sweetest baby in all the land.
3360𓀴
3361𓀴I think of her thousand coaxing arts,
3362𓀴That won her place in my heart of hearts;
3363𓀴And how at twilight, the baby's hour--
3364𓀴A winsome queen, she ruled in power;
3365𓀴And laid on my shoulder her head of gold
3366𓀴And named the stories she wanted told.
3367𓀴
3368𓀴"Goosey Loosey," "Cat and Mouse,"
3369𓀴"London Bridge," and "Jack and his House,"
3370𓀴"Peter's Pig," and "the Foolish Frog,"
3371𓀴"The Mooley Cow," and "the Poly-wog."
3372𓀴And when these were told, as many more,
3373𓀴Till I needs must add, to my ample store.
3374𓀴
3375𓀴I can think how the bright little eyes would glow
3376𓀴At the tale of the kid that was made to go.
3377𓀴How they filled with tears, when Old Mother Hubbard
3378𓀴Opened the door on an empty cupboard.
3379𓀴How they sparkled with glee, and glowed with fun
3380𓀴When she heard how the wasp made the hornet run.
3381𓀴
3382𓀴Over and over the winsome elf
3383𓀴Would plead for the stories she knew herself;
3384𓀴She would sigh o'er the fate of poor Hen-Pen
3385𓀴Who foolishly hid in the Fox's den,
3386𓀴And grieve o'er the poor little mouse that was drowned
3387𓀴Before his "great long tail" was found.
3388𓀴
3389𓀴And sitting alone in the fire-light's glow,
3390𓀴And thinking about it, all I know
3391𓀴That not on the earth, in any place,
3392𓀴Is there such another winsome face--
3393𓀴Is there another, so sweet and wise,
3394𓀴As baby Eva--beneath the skies.

3399𓀴_I SHALL NOT FORGET_
3400𓀴
3401𓀴I shall not forget you. The years may be tender,
3402𓀴  But vain are their efforts to soften my smart;
3403𓀴And the strong hands of Time are too feeble and slender
3404𓀴  To garland the grave that is made in my heart.
3405𓀴Your image is ever about me--before me,
3406𓀴  Your voice floats abroad on the voice of the wind;
3407𓀴And the spell of your presence, in absence, is o'er me,
3408𓀴  And the dead of the past, in the present I find.
3409𓀴
3410𓀴I cannot forget you. The one boon ungiven,
3411𓀴  The boon of your love, is the cross that I bear.
3412𓀴In the midnight of sorrow, I vainly have striven
3413𓀴  To crush in my heart the sweet image hid there;
3414𓀴To banish the beautiful dreams that are thronging
3415𓀴  The halls of my memory--dreams worse than vain;
3416𓀴For the one drop withheld, I am thirsting and longing,
3417𓀴  For the one joy denied, I am weeping in pain.
3418𓀴
3419𓀴I would not forget you. I live to remember
3420𓀴  The beautiful hopes that bloomed but to decay,
3421𓀴And brighter than June glows the bleakest December,
3422𓀴  When peopled with ghosts of the dreams passed away.
3423𓀴Once loving you truly, I love you forever;
3424𓀴  I mourn not in weak, idle grief for the past;
3425𓀴But the love in my bosom can never, oh never
3426𓀴  Pass out, or another pass in, first or last.
3427𓀴
3428𓀴
3429𓀴_THE OLD AND THE NEW_
3430𓀴
3431𓀴As a mother who dies in travail--
3432𓀴  Who closes her eyes in death,
3433𓀴And sinks in the sleep that is long and deep,
3434𓀴  With her babe's first wailing breath,
3435𓀴In the hush of the midnight watches,
3436𓀴  So, the old year passed away,
3437𓀴And the new was born, and was hailed this morn,
3438𓀴  As the "Happy New Year Day."
3439𓀴
3440𓀴The day when our eyes look backward,
3441𓀴  To see what our hands have done,
3442𓀴Through the hours of gold that the dead year told,
3443𓀴  Like the beads of a pious Nun--
3444𓀴When we shut up the blotted ledger,
3445𓀴  With its record of joy and grief,
3446𓀴Of losses and gains, and pleasures and pains,
3447𓀴  And turn to the new white leaf
3448𓀴
3449𓀴We hoped, we planned, and we promised,
3450𓀴  When the year that is dead was young:
3451𓀴But our hopes are like leaves that are withered,
3452𓀴  And the year like a song that is sung.
3453𓀴We planned out some wonderful project,
3454𓀴  That should bring to us riches and fame:
3455𓀴Hour by hour, day by day, our plans fell away,
3456𓀴  And our project was only a name.
3457𓀴
3458𓀴We promised that life should be better,
3459𓀴  As the sphere of our labors grew broad,
3460𓀴That "those things behind" should pass from the mind,
3461𓀴  As we reached for the prize of our God.
3462𓀴But alas, for the promises given!
3463𓀴  Lo, what were our good resolves worth?
3464𓀴They were lost to our sight, and we strayed from the light,
3465𓀴  And worshiped the poor things of earth.
3466𓀴
3467𓀴And so, while we builded our castles,
3468𓀴  With turrets of sapphire and gold,
3469𓀴Till they glowed in the sun, the months one by one,
3470𓀴  Slipped away, and the year grew old--
3471𓀴Grew feeble and old and departed
3472𓀴  In the shadows and gloom of the night;
3473𓀴And some said 'twas a year full of sorrow,
3474𓀴  And some, 'twas a year of delight.
3475𓀴
3476𓀴Some, sitting in darkness and weeping,
3477𓀴  Sob, "Oh. but the year was so long!"
3478𓀴And some, full of cheer, say the beautiful year
3479𓀴  Was only one verse of a song.
3480𓀴To some it brought gladness and pleasure,
3481𓀴  To others but sorrow and gloom.
3482𓀴It gave one the sweet orange blossoms,
3483𓀴  Another, the dust of the tomb.
3484𓀴
3485𓀴There are mothers to-day who are sitting,
3486𓀴  With arms that are aching to hold
3487𓀴The small form of grace, and the dear little face,
3488𓀴  And the head with its crown of spun gold;
3489𓀴And they think of the last happy New Year,
3490𓀴  And the voice that made music all day,
3491𓀴And, sitting alone in the silence, they moan,
3492𓀴  For the babe that is hidden away.
3493𓀴
3494𓀴There are maidens, in love-letters, reading
3495𓀴  The story so old and so new;
3496𓀴And their happy hearts beat, in a rhythm so sweet,
3497𓀴  As they read of the love strong and true;
3498𓀴And they think that of all the glad New Years,
3499𓀴  There was never another so glad;
3500𓀴And they heed not the wail of the mother, so pale,
3501𓀴  Who thinks the day dreary and sad.
3502𓀴
3503𓀴There are some leaning over the coffin
3504𓀴  Of a hope that went out with the year;
3505𓀴And their sad eyes are dry, and the lips white that cry,
3506𓀴  "The hope of a life-time lies here."
3507𓀴God pity and comfort such mourners,
3508𓀴  For God alone knoweth the pain
3509𓀴Of these suffering hearts, when a dear hope departs,
3510𓀴  And is buried to rise not again.
3511𓀴
3512𓀴It is sad to lean over a loved one,
3513𓀴  And cover the face with a pall,
3514𓀴But who mourns, with bowed head, o'er a hope that is dead,
3515𓀴  Has the bitterest sorrow of all.
3516𓀴God grant that this New Year may bring them,
3517𓀴  Some other hope, fully as sweet;
3518𓀴May it cull the bright flowers from happiness' bowers,
3519𓀴  And cast them in wreaths at their feet.
3520𓀴
3521𓀴Despair and delight walk together;
3522𓀴  The sunshine falls over the tomb;
3523𓀴And close by the weary, whose lives are all dreary,
3524𓀴  Walk those who are crowned with earth's bloom.
3525𓀴Some wearing the laurels of glory,
3526𓀴  And flushed with the glow of success,
3527𓀴May their wreaths never pale, or their honors grow stale,
3528𓀴  Or their hopes or their happiness less.
3529𓀴
3530𓀴Oh, wonderful year that has left us!
3531𓀴  Full of tragedy, sorrow and change,
3532𓀴Was there ever another so fateful,
3533𓀴  Was there ever another so strange?
3534𓀴Great hearts that were throbbing last New Year
3535𓀴  Are food for the grave-worms to-day,
3536𓀴And lips whose least word a whole nation heard,
3537𓀴  Are nothing but cold, silent clay.
3538𓀴
3539𓀴There was one who was crowned with the Fern Leaves,
3540𓀴  Whose ringing tones, full of good cheer,
3541𓀴Lightened hearts that were sad, and made weary ones glad,
3542𓀴  On many a weary New Year.
3543𓀴There was one double-dowered by heaven,
3544𓀴  Twice gifted and favored by God,
3545𓀴REID, whose brush, and whose pen, made him king among men,--
3546𓀴  He, too, lieth under the sod.
3547𓀴
3548𓀴And another, the hero of battles.
3549𓀴  Before whom the enemy fled
3550𓀴In alarm and dismay, while he won the day,
3551𓀴  MEAD,--warrior and hero, is dead.
3552𓀴There was one who climbed up the steep ladder,
3553𓀴  Step by step, on rounds that he made;
3554𓀴And carved out his name, on the summit of Fame,
3555𓀴  In letters that never will fade.
3556𓀴
3557𓀴He struggled for knowledge and riches,
3558𓀴  Position and glory, and _won_.
3559𓀴But, reaching too far, like a child for a star,
3560𓀴  He fell, with the words, "It is done!"
3561𓀴It is done, all the climbing and toiling;
3562𓀴  It is done, all the worry and strife,
3563𓀴All the bitter and sweet, th' success and defeat,--
3564𓀴  It is done, the great drama of life.
3565𓀴
3566𓀴It is done, all the year could do for us,
3567𓀴  Its mixture of shadow and sun,
3568𓀴Its smiles and its tears, its hopes and its fears,
3569𓀴  Its labors and duties, all done.
3570𓀴We stand face to face with the New Year,
3571𓀴  Nor know what it hides from our sight;
3572𓀴God grant that it be kind to you, and to me,
3573𓀴  That it lead us in ways that are light.
3574𓀴
3575𓀴The bells in the steeples are joyful,
3576𓀴  The children are shouting in glee,
3577𓀴There is mirth and good cheer in the happy New Year--
3578𓀴  All hail to young '73!
3579𓀴Come out of the shadows, ye mourners!
3580𓀴  And drop, for this one day at least,
3581𓀴  And take part in the revel and feast.
3582𓀴
3583𓀴Let us laugh like gay children together,
3584𓀴  Forgetting we ever shed tears--
3585𓀴Forgetting the losses, the sorrows and crosses
3586𓀴  That came to our lives with the years--
3587𓀴Remembering only the perfume,
3588𓀴  The beauty, the bloom, and the sun,
3589𓀴Let us talk of the New Years departed,
3590𓀴  And call this the happiest one.

3595𓀴_DECORATION POEM_
3596𓀴
3597𓀴A year that was solemn, and sad and strange,
3598𓀴  Has passed away to its tomb,
3599𓀴Since we made the graves of our dear, dead braves
3600𓀴  Like a garden, all abloom,--
3601𓀴A year that brought sorrow, and want, and change--
3602𓀴  A year with a fateful breath:
3603𓀴And the dreaded beat of its flame-shod feet
3604𓀴  Wrought ruin, and woe, and death.
3605𓀴
3606𓀴High and higher the tongues of fire
3607𓀴  Leaped up in a single night,
3608𓀴Till the walls of a town went crumbling down,
3609𓀴  And a city fell in her might.
3610𓀴And with flame and disease, and woes like these,
3611𓀴  Death laughed in his mad, wild glee;
3612𓀴And Pestilence loosened his imps in the land,
3613𓀴  And ships went down at sea.
3614𓀴
3615𓀴But with all of the passion, and pain, and fear,--
3616𓀴  With all of the long, sad hours,--
3617𓀴We have not forgotten to offer here
3618𓀴  Our yearly tribute of flowers.
3619𓀴I think the heart in a loyal breast
3620𓀴  Knows no such word as _forget_;
3621𓀴And I think--nay, know--that in weal or in woe,
3622𓀴  _We_ shall remember our debt.
3623𓀴
3624𓀴The debt of a nation redeemed from shame,
3625𓀴  And a million of slaves set free,
3626𓀴Of a spotless fame, and cherished name,
3627𓀴  Honored on land and sea.
3628𓀴Of the dear old flag kept out of the dust,
3629𓀴  The flag of the brave and true,
3630𓀴And this is the debt we are owing yet
3631𓀴  To the boys who wore the blue.
3632𓀴
3633𓀴Thousands are sleeping in Southern graves,
3634𓀴  With no slab to tell us where;
3635𓀴But the land where the sweet magnolia waves,
3636𓀴  God's hands keep fresh and fair.
3637𓀴And the angels above; in pity and love,
3638𓀴  Watch over the unknown mound,
3639𓀴Where some heart's joy, some mother's boy,
3640𓀴  A nameless grave has found.
3641𓀴
3642𓀴To a clear sweet song that is free and strong,
3643𓀴  Yet sad with a minor strain,
3644𓀴I liken the lives of the boys in blue,
3645𓀴  Who died ere they knew our gain;
3646𓀴To a glad, glad song, that rings loud and bold,
3647𓀴  In a stirring major key,
3648𓀴I liken in thought, the boys who fought,
3649𓀴  And were crowned with victory.
3650𓀴
3651𓀴To the hero who comes with the beating of drums,
3652𓀴  We can give the laurels of fame;
3653𓀴And with mirth, and music, and song and feast,
3654𓀴  We can honor and praise his name;
3655𓀴But we bring to the bed of the sainted dead,
3656𓀴  Only these wreaths to-day;
3657𓀴Yet they speak with their bloom and sweet perfume,
3658𓀴  More than our lips can say.
3659𓀴
3660𓀴They speak of a love that can never die,
3661𓀴  But strengthen and grow with time;
3662𓀴Of lives that blossom again on high,--
3663𓀴  Of a faith and hope sublime.
3664𓀴They tell how a grateful nation's heart
3665𓀴  Remembers her tried and true,
3666𓀴And how tears are shed for the honored dead,
3667𓀴  For the boys who wore the blue.
3668𓀴
3669𓀴They speak of the higher and purer life
3670𓀴  That the Lord's dear angels know;
3671𓀴Where nought can enter of pain or strife,
3672𓀴  And tears can never flow.
3673𓀴Sleep on brave boys your graves are as green
3674𓀴  As the thoughts we give to ye,
3675𓀴And these blooms will say ye are shrined alway
3676𓀴  In the halls of memory.

3681𓀴_AT SET OF SUN_
3682𓀴
3683𓀴If we sit down at set of sun,
3684𓀴And count the things that we have done,
3685𓀴    And counting, find
3686𓀴One self-denying act, one word
3687𓀴That eased the heart of him who heard,
3688𓀴    One glance, most kind,
3689𓀴That fell like sunshine where it went--
3690𓀴Then we may count that day well spent.
3691𓀴
3692𓀴Or, on the other hand, if we,
3693𓀴In looking through the day, can see
3694𓀴    A place or spot
3695𓀴Where we an unkind act put down,
3696𓀴Or where we smiled when wont to frown,
3697𓀴    Or crushed some thought
3698𓀴That cumbered the heart--ground where it stood--
3699𓀴Then we may count that day as good.
3700𓀴
3701𓀴But if, through all the life-long day,
3702𓀴We've eased no heart by yea or nay;
3703𓀴    If through it all
3704𓀴We've done no thing that we can trace,
3705𓀴That brought the sunshine to a face--
3706𓀴    No act most small
3707𓀴That helped some soul, and nothing cost--
3708𓀴Then count that day as worse than lost.

3713𓀴_LOVE SONG_
3714𓀴
3715𓀴When the glad spring time walked over the border,
3716𓀴  And the brown honey bee crept from his cell;
3717𓀴When the sun and the west wind put nature in order,
3718𓀴  And decked her in robes that became her so well,
3719𓀴Then did my torpid heart waken from slumber,
3720𓀴  Then did I first spring to life and to light.
3721𓀴For what were the years passed without thee; they number
3722𓀴  Only as one long, dark, flavorless night.
3723𓀴
3724𓀴In the flush of the spring time, I saw thee, and seeing,
3725𓀴  Loved with the love that had waited for thee.
3726𓀴A life that I never had known, sprang to being--
3727𓀴  A life and a love that were heaven to me.
3728𓀴There never before was such warmth in the summer,
3729𓀴  There never before were such hues in the fall,
3730𓀴Never such balm in the breath of that comer
3731𓀴  Who shrouds the dead seasons, and rules over all.
3732𓀴
3733𓀴Love, I have drunk in the charm of thy presence,
3734𓀴  The elixir that grants me perpetual life.
3735𓀴My blood leaps, and bounds! I am thrilled with the essence,
3736𓀴  And soar over trials, and troubles, and strife.
3737𓀴We live, and we love! and what grief can alarm us;
3738𓀴  Darling, my darling, the world is our own!
3739𓀴Life never can rob us--death cannot disarm us
3740𓀴  Of this, our vast riches, our wealth, love, alone.
3741𓀴
3742𓀴The summer is dead! Did'st know it, my darling?
3743𓀴  Did'st know that the winter walked over the earth?
3744𓀴The gold-breasted thrush, and the quaker-crowned starling
3745𓀴  Make glad other lands, with their innocent mirth.
3746𓀴Ah no! for the summer of love in thy bosom,
3747𓀴  Make summer and sunlight, for thee, everywhere.
3748𓀴_I_ should not have known: but I missed the bright blossom
3749𓀴  That all through the summer, I saw in thy hair.

3754𓀴_DISPLAY_
3755𓀴
3756𓀴Oh, households wherein skeletons abide!
3757𓀴  Keep the dark closet closed, nor think it wise
3758𓀴  To throw the door open for stranger eyes,
3759𓀴To see the grinning, fleshless thing inside.
3760𓀴
3761𓀴I hate that senseless, imbecile display
3762𓀴  Of loathsome things, that calls the gaping crowd
3763𓀴  To gaze and comment. Let the screening shroud
3764𓀴Cover the faces of the dead, I say.
3765𓀴
3766𓀴And if a household counts a skeleton,
3767𓀴  Then keep the ghastly phantom closeted;
3768𓀴  Nor flaunt the bones of the unquiet dead
3769𓀴For all the vulgar throng to gaze upon.
3770𓀴
3771𓀴Oh, you whose souls are burdened cruelly,
3772𓀴  Who shrink in anguish at the bitter smart
3773𓀴  That gnaweth, burneth, at your very heart--
3774𓀴Cover the wounds, that strangers shall not see!
3775𓀴
3776𓀴Think you a bleeding heart will sooner heal,
3777𓀴  To hang where all the cutting winds that blow,
3778𓀴  And all the birds of prey can mock its woe?
3779𓀴I hate that vain parade, of all we feel.
3780𓀴
3781𓀴Whoever knew the world to give relief
3782𓀴  To any private sorrow of a heart!
3783𓀴  Its sneering pity is a poisoned dart!
3784𓀴Then closet well your phantoms, and your grief.

3789𓀴_AT THE WINDOW_
3790𓀴
3791𓀴Every morning, as I walk down
3792𓀴From my dreary lodgings, toward the town,
3793𓀴I see at the window near the street,
3794𓀴The face of a woman, fair, and sweet,
3795𓀴With soft brown eyes, and chestnut hair,
3796𓀴And red lips, warm with the kiss left there.
3797𓀴And she lingers as long as she can see
3798𓀴The man who walks, just ahead of me.
3799𓀴
3800𓀴At night, when I come from my office, down town,
3801𓀴There stands the woman, with eyes of brown,
3802𓀴Smiling out through the window-blind,
3803𓀴At the man who comes strolling on behind.
3804𓀴This fellow and I resemble each other;
3805𓀴At least, so I'm told, by one and another.
3806𓀴(But I think I'm the handsomer, far, of the two.)
3807𓀴I don't know him at all, save to "how d'ye do,"
3808𓀴Or nod when I meet him. I think he's at work
3809𓀴In a dry goods store, as a salaried clerk.
3810𓀴
3811𓀴And I am a lawyer, of high renown;
3812𓀴Have a snug bank account, and an office down town.
3813𓀴Yet I feel for that fellow an envious spite:
3814𓀴(It has no better name, so I speak it outright.)
3815𓀴There were symptoms before: but it's grown, I believe,
3816𓀴Alarmingly fast, since one cloudy eve,
3817𓀴When passing the little house, close by the street,
3818𓀴I heard the patter of two tiny feet,
3819𓀴And a figure in pink, fluttered down to the gate,
3820𓀴And a sweet voice exclaimed, "Oh, Will, you are late
3821𓀴And, darling, I've watched at the window until--
3822𓀴Sir, I beg pardon! I thought it was Will."
3823𓀴
3824𓀴I passed on my way, with an odd little smart
3825𓀴Beneath my vest pocket, in what's called the heart.
3826𓀴For, as it happens, my name, too, is Will;
3827𓀴And that voice crying "darling" sent such a strange thrill
3828𓀴Throughout my whole being. "How nice it would be,"
3829𓀴Thought I, "if it were in reality me
3830𓀴That she's watched and longed for, instead of that lout."
3831𓀴(It was envy made me use that word, no doubt,
3832𓀴For he's a fine fellow, and handsome, ahem!)
3833𓀴But then it's absurd that this rare little gem
3834𓀴Of a woman, should be on the look-out for him,
3835𓀴Till she brings on a headache, and makes her eyes dim,
3836𓀴While I go to lodgings, dull, dreary, and bare,
3837𓀴With no one to welcome me, no one to care
3838𓀴If I'm early, or late--no soft eyes of brown
3839𓀴To watch when I go to, or come from, the town.
3840𓀴
3841𓀴This bleak, wretched bachelor life, is about,
3842𓀴If I may be allowed the expression--played out.
3843𓀴Somewhere there must be, in this wide world, I think,
3844𓀴Another fair woman, who dresses in pink.
3845𓀴And I know of a cottage for sale just below,
3846𓀴And it has a French window, in front, and--heigho
3847𓀴I wonder how long, at the longest, 'twill be,
3848𓀴Before coming home from the office I'll see
3849𓀴A nice little woman there, watching for me.

3854𓀴_HOW_
3855𓀴
3856𓀴How can I let my youth go by?
3857𓀴  How can I let Time mark my brow,
3858𓀴And steal the light of a laughing eye,
3859𓀴  And whiten the locks that are nut brown now.
3860𓀴    And the tide that goes,
3861𓀴    And ripples, and flows,
3862𓀴Like a beautiful river, on forever,
3863𓀴Over my head, through every vein,
3864𓀴And fills me, and thrills me, with joy like pain,
3865𓀴    Old cruel Time,
3866𓀴    With a touch of rime,
3867𓀴Will drug, and chill, and freeze, until
3868𓀴    It likes a stream,
3869𓀴    In its winter dream.
3870𓀴
3871𓀴Ho! ho! old Time! you may chuckle and smile,
3872𓀴  But Death may cheat you, and beat you yet;
3873𓀴What shall you say, if, after a while,
3874𓀴  Ere the sun of my youth has set,
3875𓀴I go with him, to a closet dim,
3876𓀴  And closing my eyes, in a long, long rest,
3877𓀴    Lie white and cold,
3878𓀴    And never grow old,
3879𓀴  With my two hands clasped over my breast.
3880𓀴    Always young,
3881𓀴    With my song half sung--
3882𓀴  Lying under the graves' green mould;
3883𓀴    And the world, for a day
3884𓀴    Would miss me, and say,
3885𓀴  "When will the rest of the tale be told?"
3886𓀴     And then go on,
3887𓀴     Gaily on.
3888𓀴  Till its hopes were fears, and its young were old.
3889𓀴
3890𓀴    And, lying there,
3891𓀴    What should I care,
3892𓀴Though Time, in a phrenzy of baffled rage,
3893𓀴    Should beat on my grave,
3894𓀴    And howl and rave,
3895𓀴That I would not barter my youth, for age;
3896𓀴    But lie and sleep,
3897𓀴    Down low and deep.
3898𓀴Though suns of a thousand seasons set.
3899𓀴    Always young,
3900𓀴      Never old,
3901𓀴    With my song half sung.
3902𓀴      And my tale half told--
3903𓀴  Ho, ho, old Time, I may cheat you yet!

3914𓀴After losing youth and grace,
3915𓀴In the weary, foolish chase.

3928𓀴In the weary, weary race,
3929𓀴When I lost my youth, and grace?
3930𓀴
3931𓀴Is it worth the wear, and strife--
3932𓀴Worth the best part of a life?
3933𓀴Thus have men and women queried,
3934𓀴Standing on the summit, wearied
3935𓀴With the long and steep ascent,
3936𓀴When their youth and grace were spent.
3937𓀴
3938𓀴Time sweeps onward with his cycle:
3939𓀴Life is brief, and love is fickle.
3940𓀴I will pause not at his calling,

3950𓀴The harsh king, Winter, sat upon the hills,

3953𓀴  "I am no puny, maudlin king," quoth he,
3954𓀴"But a stern monarch, born to rule and reign,
3955𓀴  And I will show my power to the end;
3956𓀴The summer's flowery retinue I've slain,

3963𓀴I scorn them all! nay, I defy them all!
3964𓀴  And none can wrest the sceptre from my hand.
3965𓀴The trusty North-Wind answers to my call,
3966𓀴  And breathes his icy breath upon the land."
3967𓀴
3968𓀴The Siren, South-Wind, listening the while,
3969𓀴  Now floated airily across the lea.
3970𓀴"Oh, King!" she said, with tender tone and smile,
3971𓀴  "I come to do all homage unto thee.
3972𓀴In all the sunny region whence I came,
3973𓀴  I find none like thee, King, so brave and grand.
3974𓀴Thine is a well-deserved, unrivalled fame;
3975𓀴  I kiss in awe, dear King, thy cold white hand."
3976𓀴
3977𓀴Her words were pleasing, and most fair her face.
3978𓀴  He listened rapt, to her soft-whispered praise.
3979𓀴She nestled nearer, in her Siren grace;
3980𓀴  "Dear King," she said, "henceforth my voice shall raise
3981𓀴But songs of thy unrivalled splendor! Lo!
3982𓀴  How white thy brow is! How thy garments shine--
3983𓀴I tremble 'neath thy beaming glance, for oh,
3984𓀴  Thy wondrous beauty mak'st thee seem divine."
3985𓀴
3986𓀴The vain king listened, in a trance of bliss,
3987𓀴  To this most sweet sweet voiced Siren from the south.
3988𓀴She nestled close, and pressed a lingering kiss
3989𓀴  Upon the stern white pallor of his mouth.
3990𓀴She hung upon his breast--she pressed his cheek--
3991𓀴  And he was nothing loth to hold her there.
3992𓀴While she such tender, loving words did speak
3993𓀴  And combed his white locks, with her fingers fair.
3994𓀴
3995𓀴And so she bound him, in her Siren wiles,
3996𓀴  And stole his strength with every glance she gave,
3997𓀴And stabbed him through and through with tender smiles,
3998𓀴  And with her loving words she dug his grave.
3999𓀴And then she left him: old, and weak, and blind--
4000𓀴  And unlocked all the rivers, lakes and rills,
4001𓀴While the Queen Spring, with her whole troop behind,
4002𓀴  Of flowers, and birds, and bees, came over the hills.

4007𓀴_AFTER?_
4008𓀴
4009𓀴After the summer glory has departed,
4010𓀴  After the sun slides low adown the skies,
4011𓀴After each snowy rose, and the red-hearted,
4012𓀴  Droops in the chilling blast, and faints, and dies,
4013𓀴When the brown bee no longer seeks the clover,
4014𓀴  But flies away, and hides in his honeyed den.
4015𓀴And from the bleak hills cutting winds blow over,
4016𓀴  Full of keen darts--ah, will you love me then?
4017𓀴
4018𓀴Or is it but the passion heat of Summer,
4019𓀴  That you mistake for love within your heart?
4020𓀴And will not Winter, that unwelcome comer,
4021𓀴  With his cold, scornful sneers, make it depart?
4022𓀴Have not the subtle odors of the flowers
4023𓀴  Drugged you, and made you drunk with rare perfumes?
4024𓀴And when the winter crashes through the bowers,
4025𓀴  Will not your love fade, with the fading blooms?
4026𓀴
4027𓀴If so, I will not listen to your wooing;
4028𓀴  And I will turn from words and glances sweet.
4029𓀴Because I will not hear a drunkard's suing--
4030𓀴  Drunken with rose-scents, and the summer heat.
4031𓀴But if you woo me, in sound mind, and reason,
4032𓀴  And can convince me fully it is so,
4033𓀴And that your love will last through any season,
4034𓀴  Why then, my answer will not _quite_ be--No.

4039𓀴_IF YOU HAD BEEN TRUE_
4040𓀴
4041𓀴Love, in the glow of the sunset,
4042𓀴  I have been thinking of you.
4043𓀴Thinking what you might have made me,
4044𓀴  If you had been constant and true.
4045𓀴You know I built wonderful castles,
4046𓀴  And you had a part in them all;
4047𓀴But you cheated me, Love, you remember.
4048𓀴  And down fell each beautiful wall.
4049𓀴
4050𓀴Well, you see I lost faith in all women--
4051𓀴  The very worst thing I could do.
4052𓀴Thought they were all of one pattern,
4053𓀴  And that was inconstant, untrue.
4054𓀴I know it was but a mad fancy:
4055𓀴  Know women are truer than men.
4056𓀴But I wish I had found it out sooner,
4057𓀴  Or could live my life over again.
4058𓀴
4059𓀴For you see I have wasted my manhood;
4060𓀴  I don't really care to tell how.
4061𓀴And if I could live it all over,
4062𓀴  I think I could better it now.
4063𓀴I would marry some nice little woman--
4064𓀴  Some other, if I couldn't get you.
4065𓀴And I would be tender and faithful,
4066𓀴  And she would be constant and true.

4071𓀴_AFLOAT_
4072𓀴
4073𓀴Once there was a boat, locked fast to a shore,
4074𓀴  But rust ate the chain, day by day,
4075𓀴And the boat was loosened more and more,
4076𓀴  As the fastenings slipped away.
4077𓀴Yet, any day, an outstretched hand,
4078𓀴  Could have caught, and locked it again to land.
4079𓀴
4080𓀴But never a hand was stretched to save,
4081𓀴  And the boat at last was free;
4082𓀴And shot like an arrow over the wave,
4083𓀴  And drifted out mid-sea.
4084𓀴And never, oh never, across the main,
4085𓀴  Will the boat to the shore be brought again.
4086𓀴
4087𓀴So was my heart, love--linked to thine;
4088𓀴  But neglect ate the chains away:
4089𓀴Yet a tender word love, I opine,
4090𓀴  Would have saved it, any day.
4091𓀴Ay! a tender word, said first or last,
4092𓀴  Would have mended the chain, and held it fast.
4093𓀴
4094𓀴But the word was lacking: and so my heart,
4095𓀴  Slipped from its chains, like the boat.
4096𓀴And then as the last link fell apart,
4097𓀴  It sped o'er the waves--afloat.
4098𓀴Nor pleading hands, nor words, you see,
4099𓀴  Brings the boat to shore, or my heart to thee.
4100𓀴
4101𓀴
4102𓀴_ROSES AND LILIES_
4103𓀴
4104𓀴Roses and Lilies, both are sweet;
4105𓀴  Lily and Rose, both are fair;
4106𓀴But which to gather for mine alway,
4107𓀴  Which to gather, and keep, and wear,
4108𓀴That is the question that bothers me,
4109𓀴For I cannot wear them both, you see.
4110𓀴
4111𓀴Rose is the brightest and blithest of girls:
4112𓀴  I could lay my heart at her tiny feet,
4113𓀴And gaze forever in those dark eyes,
4114𓀴  And kiss forever those lips so sweet.
4115𓀴And holding her soft, white, clinging hand,
4116𓀴Dreamily float into Eden land.
4117𓀴
4118𓀴And Lily--Lily, my ocean pearl,
4119𓀴  So sweetly tender, so moonlight fair,
4120𓀴I could float to heaven upon her smile,
4121𓀴  And kiss forever her silken hair,
4122𓀴That droppeth down, like a golden veil
4123𓀴Over her cheek, and brow--snow pale.
4124𓀴
4125𓀴Lilies and Roses--both are fair:
4126𓀴  Rose, or Lily, which shall it be?
4127𓀴I love them both with my heart of hearts.
4128𓀴  But I cannot wed them both, you see.
4129𓀴Dark-eyed Rose, my winsome girl--
4130𓀴Moon-faced Lily, my ocean pearl.

4134𓀴
4135𓀴_IN HEAVEN WITH YOU_
4136𓀴
4137𓀴'Tis said, when we shall go across the river,
4138𓀴  Whose bridge is death, and gain the other side,
4139𓀴There in that land, with God, the mighty Giver,
4140𓀴  The heart shall evermore be satisfied.
4141𓀴
4142𓀴And yet, sometimes I cannot help but wonder,
4143𓀴  How I can live in heaven without your love;
4144𓀴How live, rejoicing, through all time, I ponder,
4145𓀴  And not have you, even with God above.
4146𓀴
4147𓀴We bear such things on earth, for we remember
4148𓀴  That life is but a little span, at best.
4149𓀴Its passion summer, but precedes December,
4150𓀴  And in the grave, we say, there will be rest.
4151𓀴
4152𓀴But after death, time stretches with no limit:
4153𓀴  Your love, no time can ever bring to me.
4154𓀴Is heaven so bright this shadow can not dim it?
4155𓀴  It seems so long--that strange Eternity.
4156𓀴
4157𓀴How could my heart, and soul, change so completely
4158𓀴  That I should never think of this up there?
4159𓀴But in the angel choruses join sweetly,
4160𓀴  Nor ever feel this gnawing grief, and care.
4161𓀴
4162𓀴How vast God's lore! how vain the skill of mortal!
4163𓀴  He did not mean that we should understand,
4164𓀴Until our feet had crossed the shining portal,
4165𓀴  The things so deep, and fathomless, and grand.
4166𓀴
4167𓀴And He has made a heaven--a place most holy,
4168𓀴  For His redeemed to sometime enter in.
4169𓀴And there is room for all the meek and lowly,
4170𓀴  Whose faith, through sorrow hath washed out all sin.
4171𓀴
4172𓀴And I believe, when we shall cross the river,
4173𓀴  Whose bridge is death, and reach the other side,
4174𓀴There in that land, with God the gracious Giver,
4175𓀴  Our hearts shall evermore be satisfied.

4180𓀴_THOU DOST NOT KNOW_
4181𓀴
4182𓀴Thou dost not know it! but to hear
4183𓀴  One word of praise from thee,
4184𓀴There is no pain I would not bear--
4185𓀴  No task too great for me.
4186𓀴My hands could tireless toil all day,
4187𓀴  My feet could tireless run,
4188𓀴If at the close thy lips would say,
4189𓀴  "Brave, noble heart, well done."
4190𓀴
4191𓀴Thou dost not know it! but to win
4192𓀴  Approval from thine eyes,
4193𓀴My soul has conquered many a sin,
4194𓀴  And conquering, neared tee skies.
4195𓀴And though the reward may not be given,
4196𓀴  In all my earthly days,
4197𓀴I feel that after death--in heaven,
4198𓀴  Thy lips will give me praise.
4199𓀴
4200𓀴Thou dost not know--may never know,
4201𓀴  That all I strive to be,
4202𓀴All things praiseworthy that I do,
4203𓀴  I strive, and do, for thee.
4204𓀴And though I seldom see thy face,
4205𓀴  Or touch thy hand, my friend,
4206𓀴Those meetings are the means of grace,
4207𓀴  That help me to the end.
4208𓀴
4209𓀴Thou dost not know that thy grand life
4210𓀴  Has been my beacon light.
4211𓀴I aim to conquer in the strife,
4212𓀴  That I may reach thy height.
4213𓀴I strive to live, so that my feet
4214𓀴  May walk the fields most fair,
4215𓀴For the afterlife, seems, oh! so sweet,
4216𓀴  Because _thou_ wilt be there.
4217𓀴
4218𓀴Thou dost not know how brave and strong
4219𓀴  A woman's heart can be.
4220𓀴But few could hide so well and long
4221𓀴  What mine has hid from thee.
4222𓀴So well, that should this idyl chance
4223𓀴  To meet thine eye, my friend,
4224𓀴Thou'd scan it with a careless glance,
4225𓀴  Nor dream to whom 'twas penned.

4231𓀴
4232𓀴Linger, linger, oh royal year!
4233𓀴  For I grieve to see you dying.
4234𓀴Rest on the hilltops--loiter near;
4235𓀴  Wait, O Time, in your flying.
4236𓀴For never, in all the twice ten years,
4237𓀴  You have brought to build my twenty.
4238𓀴Never was one so free from tears--
4239𓀴  So overflowing with plenty.
4240𓀴
4241𓀴Filled to the brim with the purest draughts,
4242𓀴  That I sip in fearless pleasure;
4243𓀴While an unseen spirit watches and laughs,
4244𓀴  And again refills the measure.
4245𓀴My brightest dreams, and my fondest hopes,
4246𓀴  The year has gathered together,
4247𓀴And right bountifully they have come to me.
4248𓀴  From the Spring to the Autumn weather.
4249𓀴
4250𓀴The rarest of flowers, subtle and sweet,
4251𓀴  That grew in the world Ideal,
4252𓀴Have dropped their seeds in the soil at my feet,
4253𓀴  And blossomed among the Real.
4254𓀴And Love, like a rose, still blossoms and blows,
4255𓀴  Passion-hearted, yet tender.
4256𓀴And my path is strewn with the glories of June,
4257𓀴  And I'm hedged about with its splendor.
4258𓀴
4259𓀴Care flew over the hills, one day,
4260𓀴  And I sang, as he swift retreated;
4261𓀴And Hope took his crown, and Joy settled down,
4262𓀴  On the throne where Care had been seated.
4263𓀴Contentment hedged me all round about,
4264𓀴  And Love built his blazing fire;
4265𓀴And Happiness poured his treasures out,
4266𓀴  And left me with no desire.
4267𓀴
4268𓀴I have walked breast high in a sea of bliss:
4269𓀴  I have loved my God, and my brother.
4270𓀴There never before was a year like this--
4271𓀴  There never can be another.
4272𓀴Linger, loiter, a little while,
4273𓀴  For I grieve to see you dying!
4274𓀴But even in grief, I can only smile,
4275𓀴  For my heart is too light for sighing.

4280𓀴_FORESHADOWED_
4281𓀴
4282𓀴My life has been a summer day complete,
4283𓀴Teeming with pleasures, tender, pure, and sweet.
4284𓀴But tiny clouds have ever dimmed the sky,
4285𓀴And they have quickly passed, and floated by.
4286𓀴
4287𓀴Oh, seldom in this thorny world of ours,
4288𓀴Is mortal's pathway so bestrewn with flowers.
4289𓀴Fragrant and fair, they ever blow and bloom,
4290𓀴Untouched by chilling frosts, and wintry gloom.
4291𓀴And I thank God, for all his tenderness,
4292𓀴And from my very soul adore, and bless
4293𓀴Him who has cast my lines in pleasant ways,
4294𓀴And crowned with joy and happiness my days.
4295𓀴
4296𓀴But sometimes, though the sun shines clear and bright,
4297𓀴And all the world seems full of joy and light,
4298𓀴A nameless shadow, none but I can see,
4299𓀴Falls on my heart, hushing its melody.
4300𓀴A nameless, voiceless shadow; but I know
4301𓀴It tells of future agony and woe.
4302𓀴Some mighty sorrow, vague and undefined,
4303𓀴But dark, and awful, waits for me, behind
4304𓀴That shadowy cloud. Something of woe and tears--
4305𓀴Of grief, and anguish, is the future years.
4306𓀴
4307𓀴It floats away, and I rejoice again,
4308𓀴With all my warm young heart untouched by pain.
4309𓀴But ever and anon I see it loom,
4310𓀴Over my life, and feel its awful gloom.
4311𓀴
4312𓀴Oh God! I know not what is hidden there.
4313𓀴But give me strength to suffer and to bear.
4314𓀴Oh, guide my soul! and teach me how to pray,
4315𓀴And make my spirit stronger every day.
4316𓀴Upon Thy mighty arm, oh! let me rest,
4317𓀴And lean. And when Thou deemest best,
4318𓀴Reveal, my Father, what is hid behind
4319𓀴The nameless shadow, vague, and undefined.

4324𓀴_FORTUNE'S WHEEL_
4325𓀴
4326𓀴My Love was a poor man's daughter,
4327𓀴  And I was a poor man's son.
4328𓀴And oft we walked on the sea shore,
4329𓀴  When the work of the day was done.
4330𓀴Hand in hand, on the gleaming strand,
4331𓀴  And our two hearts beat as one.
4332𓀴
4333𓀴My Love was meek, and gentle,
4334𓀴  And she was wondrous fair;
4335𓀴With hazel dyes in her slumbrous eyes,
4336𓀴  And chestnut shades in her hair.
4337𓀴And we raked hay on the meadow,
4338𓀴  And I gave my heart in her care.
4339𓀴
4340𓀴But the great, notched wheel of Fortune,
4341𓀴  Kept turning on and on.
4342𓀴And she was a rich man's daughter,
4343𓀴  And I was a poor man's son.
4344𓀴And she had a score of lovers, or more.
4345𓀴  But I was the favored one.
4346𓀴
4347𓀴And I passed hard by her window,
4348𓀴  Nor turned my face to see
4349𓀴The lady fair, with gems in her hair,
4350𓀴  As fine as fine could be.
4351𓀴Though I knew her heart was dying
4352𓀴  For just one word from me.
4353𓀴
4354𓀴My Love grew pale as the lily,
4355𓀴  And faded day by day,
4356𓀴And I passed by, and heard her sigh,
4357𓀴  And turned my face away.
4358𓀴For I was proud as the proudest--
4359𓀴  And her gold between us lay.
4360𓀴
4361𓀴And the great, notched wheel of Fortune
4362𓀴  Kept rolling on and on.
4363𓀴And she was a poor man's daughter,
4364𓀴  And I was a rich man's son.
4365𓀴And maids of grace smiled in my face,
4366𓀴  But I saw only one.
4367𓀴
4368𓀴I found my love in the cottage,
4369𓀴  Where first I sought her side.
4370𓀴And I shall not tell _how_ I wooed--but well,
4371𓀴  For she had not my pride.
4372𓀴And I gave my heart in her keeping,
4373𓀴  And won her for my bride.

4383𓀴    Beyond the hills of haze.
4384𓀴
4385𓀴    With mournful, pleading cries
4386𓀴Above the waters of the voiceless sea

4388𓀴    Day after day it flies.
4389𓀴
4390𓀴    Searching, but all in vain,
4391𓀴For some stray leaf that it may light upon,
4392𓀴And read the future as the days agone--
4393𓀴    Its pleasure and its pain.
4394𓀴
4395𓀴    Listening, patiently,
4396𓀴For some voice speaking from the mighty deep,
4397𓀴Revealing all the secrets it doth keep,
4398𓀴    In silence, there for me.
4399𓀴
4400𓀴    Come back and wait! my soul,
4401𓀴Day after day thy search has been in vain,
4402𓀴Voiceless and silent o'er the future's plain
4403𓀴    Its mystic waters roll.
4404𓀴
4405𓀴    God seeing, knoweth best,
4406𓀴And in his time the waters shall subside,
4407𓀴And thou shalt know what lies beneath the tide.
4408𓀴    Then wait, my soul, and rest.

4413𓀴_DAFT_
4414𓀴
4415𓀴In the warm yellow smile of the morning,
4416𓀴  She stands at the lattice pane,
4417𓀴And watches the strong young binders
4418𓀴  Stride down to the fields of grain;
4419𓀴And she counts them over and over
4420𓀴  As they pass the cottage door:
4421𓀴Are they six? she counts them seven--
4422𓀴  Are they seven? she counts one more.
4423𓀴
4424𓀴When the sun swings high in the heavens,
4425𓀴  And the reapers go shouting home,
4426𓀴She calls to the household, saying
4427𓀴  "Make haste! for the binders have come!
4428𓀴And Johnnie will want his dinner--
4429𓀴  He was always a hungry child;"
4430𓀴And they answer, "Yes, it is waiting;"
4431𓀴  Then tell you, "Her brain is wild."
4432𓀴
4433𓀴Again, in the hush of the evening,
4434𓀴  When the work of the day is done,
4435𓀴And the binders go singing homeward
4436𓀴  In the last red rays of the sun,
4437𓀴She will sit at the threshold waiting,
4438𓀴  And her withered face lights with joy:
4439𓀴"Come, Johnnie," she says, as they pass her,
4440𓀴  "Come in to the house, my boy."
4441𓀴
4442𓀴Five summers ago, her Johnnie
4443𓀴  Went out in the smile o' the morn,
4444𓀴Singing across the meadow,
4445𓀴  Striding down through the corn:
4446𓀴He towered above the binders
4447𓀴  Walking on either side,
4448𓀴And the mother's heart within her
4449𓀴  Swelled with exultant pride.
4450𓀴
4451𓀴For he was the light of the household;
4452𓀴  His brown eyes were wells of truth,
4453𓀴And his face was the face of the morning,
4454𓀴  Lit with its pure, fresh youth;
4455𓀴And his song rang out from the hill-tops,
4456𓀴  Like the mellow blast of a horn,
4457𓀴As he strode o'er the fresh shorn meadows,
4458𓀴  And down through the rows of corn.
4459𓀴
4460𓀴But hushed were the voices of singing,
4461𓀴  Hushed by the presence of death,
4462𓀴As back to the cottage they bore him--
4463𓀴  In the noontide's scorching breath.
4464𓀴For the heat of the sun had slain him,
4465𓀴  Had smitten the heart in his breast,
4466𓀴And he who had towered above them
4467𓀴  Lay lower than all the rest.
4468𓀴
4469𓀴The grain grows ripe in the sunshine,
4470𓀴  And the summers ebb and flow,
4471𓀴And the binders stride to their labor,
4472𓀴  And sing as they come and go;
4473𓀴But never again from the hill-tops
4474𓀴  Echoes the voice like a horn;
4475𓀴Never up from the meadows,
4476𓀴  Never back from the corn.
4477𓀴
4478𓀴Yet the poor, crazed brain of the mother
4479𓀴  Fancies him always near;
4480𓀴She is blest in her strange delusion,
4481𓀴  For she knoweth no pain, no fear:
4482𓀴And always she counts the binders
4483𓀴  As they pass her cottage door;
4484𓀴Are they six, she counts them seven:
4485𓀴  Are they seven, she counts one more.

4491𓀴
4492𓀴Once Pain beat on my heart,
4493𓀴  And well-nigh killed it.
4494𓀴I shuddered at the smart,
4495𓀴  But said, "God willed it."
4496𓀴And down and down again,
4497𓀴  With awful power,
4498𓀴Fell the great hand of Pain,
4499𓀴  Hour after hour.
4500𓀴
4501𓀴While, like a mighty flail,
4502𓀴  The fierce blows hurt me,
4503𓀴I cried, "God doth prevail:
4504𓀴  He'll not desert me."
4505𓀴Blow upon cruel blow,
4506𓀴  The great hand gave me,
4507𓀴Yet I cried, "He doth know,
4508𓀴  And he will save me."
4509𓀴
4510𓀴I did not loudly cry,
4511𓀴  And ask God's reason;
4512𓀴I knew He'd tell me why,
4513𓀴  In his own season.
4514𓀴"In His good time," I said,
4515𓀴  In trusting blindness,
4516𓀴And I was not afraid
4517𓀴  To wait his kindness.
4518𓀴
4519𓀴I did not trust in vain.
4520𓀴  God drew me nearer.
4521𓀴And whispered, "Smile again!
4522𓀴  The way is clearer."
4523𓀴And lo! my mortal sight
4524𓀴  Could reach to heaven,
4525𓀴My faith dispelled the night,
4526𓀴  And light was given.

4529𓀴_THE COMMON LINK_
4530𓀴
4531𓀴When on the crowded thoroughfare,
4532𓀴  Amidst the motley throng I stray,
4533𓀴In all the stranger faces there,
4534𓀴  I meet and pass from day to day,
4535𓀴Whether the face be young, or old,
4536𓀴  Or wreathed in smiles, or calm, or cold,
4537𓀴On every brow I trace some line
4538𓀴  That links the strangers' heart to mine.
4539𓀴
4540𓀴Though a proud beauty rustles by,
4541𓀴  With haughty mien, I smile and say,
4542𓀴"You have a heart-ache--so have I:
4543𓀴  We both are hiding it to-day.
4544𓀴Though you are rich, I am poor,
4545𓀴  We both have entered sorrow's door;
4546𓀴Grief comes alike to you and me,
4547𓀴  So we are of one family."
4548𓀴
4549𓀴The richest nabob that I meet,
4550𓀴  The poorest delver that I see,
4551𓀴Youth and old age upon the street,
4552𓀴  Are one and all the same to me.
4553𓀴No heart that beats, but has its grief;
4554𓀴  Nor wealth, nor youth, gives full relief;
4555𓀴And through the tears that sometimes fall
4556𓀴  I claim relationship to all.
4557𓀴
4558𓀴So poor, and rich, and high, and low,
4559𓀴  I meet upon this common plain.
4560𓀴Though far and wide our paths may lie,
4561𓀴  We entertain the same guest--Pain.
4562𓀴The subtle threads of this strange cord,
4563𓀴  Draw me to mankind, and the Lord,
4564𓀴And through the sorrows heaven sends,
4565𓀴  I hold all men to be my friends.

4571𓀴
4572𓀴Cold is the wind, that blows up from the river.
4573𓀴  Cold is the blast that sweeps over the plain.
4574𓀴In the bleak breath of the morning, I shiver--
4575𓀴  Shiver and weep, in my desolate pain.
4576𓀴She was so fair--like the beautiful lily--
4577𓀴  Fair, oh too fair to be hidden away.
4578𓀴And the grave is so dark, and so damp, and so chilly,
4579𓀴  And she--oh my love!--will be buried to-day.
4580𓀴
4581𓀴White is the snow that is heaped on the meadow,
4582𓀴  Whiter the face, in this desolate room.
4583𓀴Low in the valley lurk darkness and shadow--
4584𓀴  Low lies my heart, in its sorrow and gloom.
4585𓀴How the spades scrape, on the sods they are breaking,
4586𓀴  Breaking, and cutting the snowdrifts away.
4587𓀴How the men bend to the grave they are making,
4588𓀴  Where she--oh my love!--will be buried to-day.
4589𓀴
4590𓀴Thick are the walls! but the bleak wind will enter,
4591𓀴  And chill her through all her long slumber, I know.
4592𓀴Rich are her robes! but the merciless Winter
4593𓀴  Will beat on her breast, with its tempests of snow.
4594𓀴Oh, she was guarded, and shielded from sorrow--
4595𓀴  Kept from the shadows, and darkness, alway.
4596𓀴But she will lie, as the beggar to-morrow--
4597𓀴  My love--oh my love!--that is buried to-day.

4602𓀴_WHEN I DIE_
4603𓀴
4604𓀴Often, when I am alone,
4605𓀴  Thinking of the "things unseen;"
4606𓀴Things to our eyes never shown,
4607𓀴  Hidden by the veil between
4608𓀴This world and eternity--
4609𓀴  To be lifted by and by,
4610𓀴Oft the thought has come to me,
4611𓀴  "Who will robe me, when I die."
4612𓀴
4613𓀴When the night-time swiftly nears,
4614𓀴  And my last sleep comes apace,
4615𓀴And the mourners' bitter tears
4616𓀴  Fall above my dying face;
4617𓀴When I pass out, white and still,
4618𓀴  Where no mortal hand can save,
4619𓀴Out beyond the reach of skill--
4620𓀴  Who will robe me, for the grave?
4621𓀴
4622𓀴When my work is all complete,
4623𓀴  And I have no more to do,
4624𓀴And I pass with willing feet,
4625𓀴  From the old life, to the new;
4626𓀴While my dear ones numb with woe,
4627𓀴  Weep above my pulseless heart,
4628𓀴Who, of all the friends I know,
4629𓀴  Who will robe me to depart?
4630𓀴
4631𓀴Who will fold my pallid hands,
4632𓀴  On my quiet bosom; close
4633𓀴Eyes that gaze on other lands,
4634𓀴  Clothe me for my last repose?
4635𓀴When soft fingers toy and play
4636𓀴  With my tresses tenderly,
4637𓀴Oft the thought has come to me,
4638𓀴  "Will _these_ robe me, when I die?"
4639𓀴
4640𓀴
4641𓀴_THE UNSEEN THORN_
4642𓀴
4643𓀴"Cinnamon Roses!" she said, "how fair,"
4644𓀴  Holding them out in her finger-tips.
4645𓀴"Yes," I whispered, "the hue they wear
4646𓀴  Was borrowed out of thy cheeks, and lips.
4647𓀴Beautiful roses! and each supposes
4648𓀴  Itself replete, with thy graces, Sweet.
4649𓀴Fair they may be, yet not like thee--
4650𓀴  See! they fade at thy smile, dear maid!"
4651𓀴
4652𓀴"Give me a Rose!" and nothing loth,
4653𓀴  She tossed a beautiful bud to me.
4654𓀴But I gathered the maid and the flowers both--
4655𓀴  Close to my breast. "Not that, but _thee!_
4656𓀴I most am wanting. The dear face haunting
4657𓀴  My heart each hour, is the sweetest flower."
4658𓀴And I gathered close the face like a rose,
4659𓀴  And kissed her lips and her finger-tips.
4660𓀴
4661𓀴The leaves, from the roses in her hand,
4662𓀴  Dropped one by one: but the _thorn_ was left.
4663𓀴(Fool, that I did not understand.)
4664𓀴  Cheated, and jilted, and all bereft,
4665𓀴Of the fair, false blossom I held on my bosom
4666𓀴  I stand to-day. But the _thorn_ alway
4667𓀴Pierces my heart like a cruel dart.
4668𓀴  The rose is dead: and her love--has fled.

4673𓀴_FATHER AND CHILD_
4674𓀴
4675𓀴The New Year wedded the winter--
4676𓀴  Winter, the harsh old king!
4677𓀴Whose head was a snow-capped mountain--
4678𓀴  Whose breath was the North-Wind's sting.
4679𓀴But he wooed and wedded the maiden,
4680𓀴  And gave her a robe of snow;
4681𓀴And hung on her breast bright jewels,
4682𓀴  With a lace-work of frost below.
4683𓀴
4684𓀴And the days flowed on like a river;
4685𓀴  And the mother looked up and smiled,
4686𓀴When she laid in the arms of Winter,
4687𓀴  Their beautiful first-born child.
4688𓀴"And what shall we name our infant?"
4689𓀴  She said to the harsh old king.
4690𓀴And the old man kissed her softly,
4691𓀴  And said, "we will call her Spring."
4692𓀴
4693𓀴"And how shall we robe our darling?
4694𓀴  I have always dressed in white!
4695𓀴But she must be clothed in colors--
4696𓀴  With something soft, and bright."
4697𓀴And the old man smiled and answered,
4698𓀴  "We will give her a robe of green;
4699𓀴Trimmed with the fairest flowers,
4700𓀴  And buds, that were ever seen!"
4701𓀴
4702𓀴And he kissed the beautiful infant,
4703𓀴  Softly on cheek, and brow,
4704𓀴And he clasped the hand of the mother,
4705𓀴  And said "I am going now!
4706𓀴The days of my life were numbered,
4707𓀴  And the last is slipping away.
4708𓀴But I leave you to guard our darling,
4709𓀴  Wherever her steps shall stray."

4714𓀴_UNDER THE MOON_
4715𓀴
4716𓀴Under the moon two lovers walked--
4717𓀴  The silver moon--the round, full moon;
4718𓀴Under its beams they softly talked,
4719𓀴  Of youth, and love, and June.
4720𓀴And they plighted their vows in the silvery light,
4721𓀴For their hearts, like the moon, were full, that night.
4722𓀴
4723𓀴Under the moon they walked again--
4724𓀴  The setting the moon--the waning moon.
4725𓀴And scarcely a word was said by the twain.
4726𓀴  (Ah moon, you set too soon.)
4727𓀴For love, in one o' the hearts, like the rim
4728𓀴Of the waning moon, grew faint, and dim.
4729𓀴
4730𓀴Under the skies a maiden stood--
4731𓀴  The cold night skies--the moonless skies:
4732𓀴She heard the owl in the lonely wood,
4733𓀴  And she heard her own deep sighs.
4734𓀴"Heart and skies devoid of light;
4735𓀴Oh God!" she cried, "what a dreary night!"
4736𓀴
4737𓀴Under the skies is a narrow mound--
4738𓀴  The watchful skies--the starry skies.
4739𓀴And the rays of the moon, so full and round,
4740𓀴  Shine down, where the maiden lies.
4741𓀴And they shine on the fickle lover, who
4742𓀴Walks with another, and woos anew.

4745𓀴_SINGERS_
4746𓀴
4747𓀴The sweetest songs that were ever sung,
4748𓀴  And those that please the best,
4749𓀴Through sorrow, and grief, and tears were wrung
4750𓀴  From some o'er-burdened breast.
4751𓀴Though the words breathe only of mirth, and bloom,
4752𓀴  And the strains are the gladdest and lightest,
4753𓀴Remember that after a night of gloom,
4754𓀴  The rays of the sun are brightest.
4755𓀴
4756𓀴The rain must fall, ere the spring-time grass
4757𓀴  Grows tender, and green, and sweet.
4758𓀴Through the pangs of travail, a soul must pass,
4759𓀴  Ere a song is born complete.
4760𓀴After a winter of storm, and snow,
4761𓀴  Blossom the buds in our bowers:
4762𓀴After a season of tears and woe,
4763𓀴  Blossom the poet's flowers.
4764𓀴
4765𓀴There are few who give the poet a thought,
4766𓀴  When they read the pleasing strain.
4767𓀴There are few who know that a poem is wrought
4768𓀴  Through sorrow, and tears, and pain.
4769𓀴The merriest song, and the blithest lay,
4770𓀴  And those that are sweetest and gladdest,
4771𓀴Are woven in gloomy and cheerless days,
4772𓀴  When the poet's heart is the saddest.

4779𓀴I am groping in the shadows,
4780𓀴  And I cannot see the light.
4781𓀴Every sunbeam has departed;
4782𓀴  There is gloom throughout the land.
4783𓀴I am fainting by the wayside--
4784𓀴  Heavenly Father, take my hand.
4785𓀴
4786𓀴Oh, the paths are rough and thorny,
4787𓀴  That my weary feet have trod.
4788𓀴I am bleeding--I am dying,
4789𓀴  Take me by the hand, O God!
4790𓀴Let my gloomy way be lighted,
4791𓀴  By the glory of Thy face!
4792𓀴And thy broad and mighty bosom,
4793𓀴  Let it be my resting place.
4794𓀴
4795𓀴Through this awful night of sorrow,
4796𓀴  Father, let me hear thy voice.
4797𓀴Teach me how to sing in anguish--
4798𓀴  How to suffer, and rejoice.
4799𓀴Take me by the hand, and guide me,
4800𓀴  Lead me in the better way.
4801𓀴Through this vale of storm, and tempest,
4802𓀴  To the land of perfect day.
4803𓀴
4804𓀴Strengthen me for every contest:
4805𓀴  Let my prayer be not in vain.
4806𓀴I would bless thee in my sorrow--
4807𓀴  I would glory in my pain.
4808𓀴Make my spirit white, for heaven!
4809𓀴  Let my soul be purified
4810𓀴In the blood that flowed so freely,
4811𓀴  From the wound in Jesus' side.
4812𓀴
4813𓀴Gird my soul, oh God, for battle!
4814𓀴  I am weak, O make me strong.
4815𓀴Do not let my courage falter,
4816𓀴  Though the strife be fierce, and long.
4817𓀴And upon Thy hand, my Father,
4818𓀴  Let me keep a clinging hold,
4819𓀴Till I cross the pearly portal,
4820𓀴  To the city built of gold.

4842𓀴Tear off the shroud--dig up the ground!

4844𓀴"We have exhumed poor 'Raven Poe'
4845𓀴  And proved beyond the shade of doubt,
4846𓀴_He_ saw no raven, after all.
4847𓀴  Now trot the bones of Shakespeare out!
4848𓀴Byron, and Poe, and Shakespeare--good!
4849𓀴Who shall we serve up next for food?"
4850𓀴
4851𓀴And who, say I, oh seers of earth!
4852𓀴  What corpse comes next? I daily look
4853𓀴To see if some sage hasn't proved
4854𓀴  That Jones, or Smith, wrote Lalla Rook!
4855𓀴Or Blifkins lent his brains to Moore--
4856𓀴Who was a plagiarist, and boor.
4857𓀴
4858𓀴Sensation, keep your servants out;
4859𓀴  Let them be watchful, and alert!
4860𓀴We'll need a new discovery soon:
4861𓀴  Tell them to dig about the dirt,
4862𓀴And tear off Keats', or Shelly's shroud,
4863𓀴To please and edify the crowd.

4868𓀴_A LAWYER'S ROMANCE_
4869𓀴
4870𓀴Into the mellow light of the cloudless autumn day,
4871𓀴Somehow, the vision slips, of a landscape, far away,
4872𓀴Wherever I turn my eyes, it hovers before them still,
4873𓀴The little, vine-wreathed cot, on the southerly slope of the hill,
4874𓀴
4875𓀴The pasture at the left, the ducks a-swim in the pond,
4876𓀴And the straight, green rows of corn, with the wheat fields just beyond,
4877𓀴The sloping lawn on the right, that is always seeming to say
4878𓀴To the lake that lies below, "I will meet you just half way."
4879𓀴
4880𓀴And over and over the cot, from th' ground to th' mossy eaves,
4881𓀴Cling, and twine, and clamber the vines, with their dark, green leaves;
4882𓀴The little mimic garden, with its simple flowers a-blow,
4883𓀴Larkspur, bleeding hearts, and the clumps of phlox, like snow;
4884𓀴
4885𓀴Petunias, red and white, like drooping and fragile maids,
4886𓀴Rose trees hanging down, with roses of many shades,
4887𓀴Marigolds, bachelor-buttons, with clusters of evergreen,
4888𓀴On the two trim rows of beds, with the narrow path between,
4889𓀴
4890𓀴And the setting rays of the sun, lending it all a flush,
4891𓀴That is given to sunset scenes, by the heavenly Artist's brush.
4892𓀴It is thus it rises to-day, and hovers before my eyes;
4893𓀴I have seen it softly lit, with the mornings' sweet surprise--
4894𓀴
4895𓀴I have seen it when the dew glistened upon the grass--
4896𓀴In the hush of the summer noon, when the calm lake lay like glass--
4897𓀴In the ghostly rays o' the moon--in the quiet of the night--
4898𓀴But never half so fair as under that sunset light.
4899𓀴
4900𓀴Ah! foolish, and weak old heart, must you live it over again?
4901𓀴Why reopen the book, whose final page was Pain!
4902𓀴But the picture rises before me, rises, and hovers there,
4903𓀴And the glory of the sunset falls on the maiden's hair;
4904𓀴
4905𓀴The maid, who stood in that garden ten long summers ago.
4906𓀴Stood by the "bleeding hearts," and the clusters of phlox, like snow.
4907𓀴Ah! musty and dusty old heart, you were younger and lighter then!
4908𓀴Yet not young, for now you have beat, two score years and ten;
4909𓀴
4910𓀴But that one summer holds the essence of all my life,
4911𓀴The forty years before were records of toil and strife,
4912𓀴And I opened the book again, when my holiday was o'er,
4913𓀴And began at the page I left, and plodded on as before.
4914𓀴
4915𓀴Weary of law, of work, of the dust, and heat of th' town,
4916𓀴Ill, in body and mind, my heart went longing down
4917𓀴To the cool, green country meadows; and I followed it one day,
4918𓀴And there in the vine-wreathed cot, let the summer slip away;
4919𓀴
4920𓀴Ay! and I let the heart I had guarded forty years--
4921𓀴The heart that had never been stirred by love's wild hopes and fears--
4922𓀴I let it slip away to the maid with amber eyes,
4923𓀴With tresses dusky brown, and cheeks like th' sunset skies.
4924𓀴
4925𓀴Ah! secret I tried to keep, ah! love I strove to hide!
4926𓀴But in the July twilight, I lingered at her side,
4927𓀴And, leaning by the rose tree, her tresses swept my cheek!
4928𓀴"Ah! sweet," I cried in a tremor, "I love you--let me speak!"
4929𓀴
4930𓀴And then, somehow the love I had thought to guard untold
4931𓀴Broke loose from the fetters of silence, and gathered strength, and rolled
4932𓀴Forth in a torrent of words; and I knelt at the maiden's feet,
4933𓀴Crying, "Grant me a token, as yea or nay, my sweet."
4934𓀴
4935𓀴And then, with a shy, sweet smile, she gave me her finger-tips,
4936𓀴And, bolder grown, I said, as I raised them to my lips,
4937𓀴"'Twere a lesser love than mine, that were wholly satisfied,
4938𓀴With a touch of your fingertips, and farther than that denied."
4939𓀴
4940𓀴The curtains of her eyes dropped low, and I drew her close,
4941𓀴And over and over again kissed the sweet face like a rose.
4942𓀴I said, "I have pleaded a case, and won it; do you see?
4943𓀴And now I take my pay! for a lawyer must have his fee."
4944𓀴
4945𓀴Ah! summer over and gone, into the echoless past!
4946𓀴Oh! August afternoons, that drifted by too fast!
4947𓀴Oh! rows on the quiet lake, in the blissful moonlit eves,
4948𓀴When the harvesters sang their song, carrying home the sheaves.
4949𓀴
4950𓀴I can hear it even now, the voices, strong and sweet,
4951𓀴Over the noise, and rattle, and roar of the busy street,
4952𓀴I can see the face of Mable, full lipped, ripe, and fair,
4953𓀴With the amber tints in her eyes, and the dusky shades on her hair.
4954𓀴
4955𓀴Into my life's September, came the beauty I missed in June,
4956𓀴The glory lost in the morning, came in the afternoon.
4957𓀴The dream that belongs to youth, golden--complete--sublime,
4958𓀴I dreamed not, in the spring, but in the autumn time.
4959𓀴
4960𓀴Ah! and the young heart wakes from the dream of love, and then,
4961𓀴Suffers a little while, and dreams it over again.
4962𓀴But never a second draught of the wine of love for me,
4963𓀴I drank it all at the first, and shattered the cup, you see.
4964𓀴
4965𓀴I woke from the golden dream when I saw _her_ on the breast
4966𓀴Of a fair-faced, beardless youth--when I saw his red lips pressed
4967𓀴Over and over again to the mouth, like a rose half blown,
4968𓀴And I heard her whispered words--"My only love, my own."
4969𓀴
4970𓀴Hush! censure them not! His heart she toyed with even as mine.
4971𓀴He suffered keenly, I think, then knelt at another's shrine.
4972𓀴And she--speak softly of her--she died: she is only dust;
4973𓀴Died repentant--forgiven--and entered Heaven--I trust.
4974𓀴
4975𓀴And I--well my years drift on, as my two-score drifted away,
4976𓀴Only at times, this memory comes, as it came to-day,
4977𓀴Thrilling me through and through--and I live it all once more,
4978𓀴Though I shut the past away, and have striven to lock the door.
4979𓀴
4980𓀴Have I lost all faith in woman? Nay, surely not: should we
4981𓀴Say that every heart is false because _one_ proves to be!
4982𓀴Because I find a worm in the petals of a rose,
4983𓀴Shall I say that worms are coiled in every flower that blows?
4984𓀴
4985𓀴Nay, there are constant woman, and women as sweet and fair
4986𓀴As she with the amber eyes, and the shadows on her hair.
4987𓀴But I found the wine of love so late, that when I quaffed
4988𓀴I held none in reserve, but drank it all at a draught.
4989𓀴
4990𓀴The future? I do not dread: it is neither dark nor bright.
4991𓀴I have had my day of joy--I have had my sorrow's night.
4992𓀴God helped me through the last--I do not know just how,
4993𓀴But He answered when I called Him, and why should I doubt him now?
4994𓀴
4995𓀴Nor mortal eye can see, nor mortal heart conceive,
4996𓀴What He holdeth in His kingdom for the faithful that believe.
4997𓀴But I sometimes think the dream that was broken here for me,
4998𓀴I shall finish and complete by the shining Jasper sea.

5003𓀴_A SUMMER DAY_
5004𓀴
5005𓀴There's a gaping rent in the curtain
5006𓀴  That longs for a needle and thread,
5007𓀴There's a garment that ought to be finished,
5008𓀴  And a book that wants to be read.
5009𓀴There's a letter that needs to be answered,
5010𓀴  There are clothes to fold away,
5011𓀴And I know these tasks are waiting,
5012𓀴  And ought to be done to-day.
5013𓀴
5014𓀴But how can I mend the curtain,
5015𓀴  While watching this silvery cloud,
5016𓀴And how can I finish th' garment.
5017𓀴  When the robin calls so loud.
5018𓀴And the whispering trees are telling
5019𓀴  Such stories above my head,
5020𓀴That I can but lie and listen,
5021𓀴  And the book is all unread.
5022𓀴
5023𓀴If I try to write the letter,
5024𓀴  I am sure one half the words
5025𓀴Will be in the curious language
5026𓀴  Of my chattering friends, the birds.
5027𓀴The lilacs bloom in the sunshine,
5028𓀴  The roses nod and smile,
5029𓀴And the clothes that ought to be folded
5030𓀴  And ironed, must wait awhile.
5031𓀴
5032𓀴I lie in the locust shadows,
5033𓀴  And gaze at the summer sky,
5034𓀴Bidding the cares and troubles
5035𓀴  And trials of life pass by.
5036𓀴The beautiful locust blossoms
5037𓀴  Are falling about my feet,
5038𓀴And the dreamy air is laden
5039𓀴  With their odors rare and sweet.
5040𓀴
5041𓀴The honey-bees hum in the clover,
5042𓀴  The grasses rise and fall,
5043𓀴The robin stops and listens,
5044𓀴  As he hears the brown thrush call.
5045𓀴The humming-bird sings to me softly,
5046𓀴  The butterfly flits away--
5047𓀴Oh, what could be sweeter than living,
5048𓀴  This beautiful summer day!

5053𓀴_SONG AND MAID_
5054𓀴
5055𓀴A poet toiled over a song, for the maid
5056𓀴  Who had plighted her troth to him.
5057𓀴And he leaned, and wrote, in the gathering shade,
5058𓀴  Till his eyes were dim.
5059𓀴
5060𓀴But the maiden strolled on the distant beach,
5061𓀴And listed another's tender speech.
5062𓀴
5063𓀴The poet sang of her love-lit eye,
5064𓀴  So softly, and deeply blue;
5065𓀴How its soulful glance--half arch, half shy,
5066𓀴  He only knew.
5067𓀴
5068𓀴But the maid's blue eyes were shedding their light
5069𓀴On the face of a tall, dark man, that night.
5070𓀴
5071𓀴He sang of her hand, so white, and fair,
5072𓀴  And soft as a hand could be.
5073𓀴"And the ring," he sang, "that is gleaming there
5074𓀴  Binds her to me."
5075𓀴
5076𓀴But the maid to her tall companion said,
5077𓀴"This ring? 'tis the gift of a friend, now dead."
5078𓀴
5079𓀴He sang of her ripe and dewy lips--
5080𓀴  "They are roses before they blow,
5081𓀴And the taste of the nectar that from them drips
5082𓀴  I only know."
5083𓀴
5084𓀴But the maid, as she walked in the moonlight mist,
5085𓀴Lifted her face, and was lovingly kissed.
5086𓀴
5087𓀴He sang of her voice, "It is soft and clear
5088𓀴  As the voice of a gentle dove.
5089𓀴So tender, that I alone can hear
5090𓀴  Her words of love."
5091𓀴
5092𓀴But the maiden whispered to one by the sea,
5093𓀴"I love thee, darling, and only thee."
5094𓀴
5095𓀴Ah, poet! finish your last light strain:
5096𓀴  Ah, maid! shall we give you praise, or blame?
5097𓀴You are wringing a heart, with bitter pain,
5098𓀴  Yet helping to laurel a brow with fame.
5099𓀴
5100𓀴For out of the depths of a master woe,
5101𓀴  And through the valley of dark despair,
5102𓀴The soul of a singer must grope, and go,
5103𓀴  Ere he wear the purple true poets wear.
5104𓀴
5105𓀴
5106𓀴_ASLEEP_
5107𓀴
5108𓀴"Come closer," she said, "my sister,
5109𓀴  For I can not see your face.
5110𓀴The day grows dim, and the shadows grim,
5111𓀴  Are gathering on apace.
5112𓀴I am glad that the night is coming:
5113𓀴  I am weary, and want to rest.
5114𓀴What! do you weep, that I fall asleep
5115𓀴  Leaning upon your breast?
5116𓀴
5117𓀴"Oh, Sister, I am _so_ tired:
5118𓀴  How tired you can not know.
5119𓀴And a jarring pain, in my weary brain,
5120𓀴  Beats like a cruel blow.
5121𓀴I think it will all have vanished,
5122𓀴  After I sleep awhile.
5123𓀴How sweetly I rest, lying here on your breast.
5124𓀴  In the warmth of your loving smile.
5125𓀴
5126𓀴"Such a beautiful dream, my sister,
5127𓀴  I dreamed while I slept last night.
5128𓀴I thought he was true: and he came with you,
5129𓀴  And kissed me in love's delight.
5130𓀴And he said--. But I am so weary,
5131𓀴  I will sleep ere I tell the rest."
5132𓀴But the sister wept, for the maiden slept
5133𓀴  In the sleep of death, on her breast.

5138𓀴_TWO COUNTS_
5139𓀴
5140𓀴If I count my life by the ticking of clocks,
5141𓀴  In the old methodical way,
5142𓀴If I count by the years, and the years' twelve blocks,
5143𓀴  If I figure it out by the ceaseless flocks
5144𓀴Of hours that make a day,
5145𓀴  If I count from the annual calendar,
5146𓀴And trust to the measured years in there,
5147𓀴  Well, then I have turned, we'll say,
5148𓀴But a notch, or two, on the wheel of time;
5149𓀴I am still in the flush of my youths' glad prime;
5150𓀴  My life is new,
5151𓀴    As the count will say.
5152𓀴  I am scarcely through
5153𓀴    With the opening play.
5154𓀴  I am, in truth.
5155𓀴    In the flush of youth,
5156𓀴If I trust to ticking and striking of clocks,
5157𓀴And count by the years, and the years' twelve blocks.
5158𓀴
5159𓀴If I count my life by the beat, throb, beat,
5160𓀴  Of the weary heart in my breast,
5161𓀴If I count by the aims that have met defeat,
5162𓀴  And the vain, vain search for rest,
5163𓀴    If I count by tears,
5164𓀴    And by haunting fears,
5165𓀴    By hopes that were all in vain,
5166𓀴    By dear trusts shattered,
5167𓀴    And good ships battered,
5168𓀴    And lost on the treacherous main,
5169𓀴    By faith unfounded,
5170𓀴    And love death-wounded,
5171𓀴  If I reckon it thus, why then
5172𓀴Counting this way, I have lived, we'll say,
5173𓀴  Full three-score years, and ten.

5178𓀴_THE WATCHER_
5179𓀴
5180𓀴"I think I hear the sound of horses' feet.
5181𓀴  Beating upon the gravelled avenue.
5182𓀴Go to the window that looks on the street!
5183𓀴  He would not let me die, alone, I knew!"
5184𓀴Back to the couch the patient watcher passed.
5185𓀴And said, "It is the wailing of the blast."
5186𓀴
5187𓀴She turned upon her couch, and seeming, slept,
5188𓀴  The long, dark lashes, shadowing her cheek.
5189𓀴And on, and on, the weary moments crept,
5190𓀴  When suddenly the watcher heard her speak,
5191𓀴"I think I hear the sound of horses' hoofs!"
5192𓀴And answered, "'Tis the rain, upon the roofs."
5193𓀴
5194𓀴Unbroken silence: quiet, deep, profound.
5195𓀴  The restless sleeper turns. "How dark! how late!
5196𓀴What is it that I hear--that trampling sound?
5197𓀴  I think there is a horseman at the gate!"
5198𓀴The watcher turns away her eyes, tear-blind.
5199𓀴"It is the shutter, beating in the wind."
5200𓀴
5201𓀴The dread night passed. The patient clock ticked on.
5202𓀴  The weary watcher moved not from her place.
5203𓀴The gray, dun shadows of the early dawn,
5204𓀴  Caught sudden glory, from the sleeper's face.
5205𓀴"He comes! my love! I knew he would!" she cried,
5206𓀴  And, smiling sweetly in her slumbers, died.

5211𓀴_LIFE AND DEATH_
5212𓀴
5213𓀴Three days agone, and she was here:
5214𓀴  Her light step on the stair was springing.
5215𓀴Her sweet voice fell upon my ear;
5216𓀴  (She mocked the thrushes in her singing.)
5217𓀴The billows of her long, bright hair
5218𓀴  Fell round her, in a golden splendor.
5219𓀴Her face was young and fresh and fair;
5220𓀴  Her eyes were innocent and tender.
5221𓀴
5222𓀴Her presence filled the house: each room
5223𓀴  Breathed of her pure and sweet existence.
5224𓀴She was like some rare plant in bloom,
5225𓀴  Its fragrance reaching through the distance.
5226𓀴Here was her ribbon--there her book,
5227𓀴  Beyond, her wreath, or faded flower.
5228𓀴A step, a voice, a laugh, a look,
5229𓀴  Told of her presence, hour by hour.
5230𓀴
5231𓀴"How strange is life!" I said, "From naught
5232𓀴  God fashioned out this glowing creature.
5233𓀴Endowed with motion, feeling thought--
5234𓀴  Perfect in symmetry, and feature.
5235𓀴Sweeter than any opening rose,
5236𓀴  All grace and beauty hangs about her.
5237𓀴Though every flower were left that blows,
5238𓀴  Earth would be bare and bleak, without her."
5239𓀴
5240𓀴Three days agone! ay! life is strange,
5241𓀴  But death is stranger, vaster, deeper.
5242𓀴It brings us tears, and gloom, and change.
5243𓀴  _She_ was God's sheaf, and Death His reaper.
5244𓀴Three days! and now no voice is heard--
5245𓀴  No light step on the stair is bounding.
5246𓀴In vain the tuneful-throated bird
5247𓀴  Listens to hear her answer sounding.
5248𓀴
5249𓀴I cannot find her, anywhere!
5250𓀴  How vast and strange the mystic power,
5251𓀴That leaves but one soft strand of hair,
5252𓀴  Of all that golden, shining shower.
5253𓀴In door, and out, in every place,
5254𓀴  I search and seek; oh, vain endeavor!
5255𓀴The voice, the laugh, the form, the face,
5256𓀴  Have vanished from the earth forever.
5257𓀴
5258𓀴A spot of ground, a fresh-turned sod,
5259𓀴  Hides what was beautiful and mortal.
5260𓀴Her spirit (fairer still) to God,
5261𓀴  And life eternal, crossed the portal.
5262𓀴Frailer than any opening rose,
5263𓀴  The winds of earth blew cold about her.
5264𓀴Fairer than any flower that grows,
5265𓀴  Heaven was not complete without her.

5270𓀴_AN AUTUMN REVERIE_
5271𓀴
5272𓀴Through all the weary, hot midsummer time,
5273𓀴  My heart has struggled with its awful grief.
5274𓀴And I have waited for these autumn days,
5275𓀴  Thinking the cooling winds would bring relief.
5276𓀴For I remembered how I loved them once,
5277𓀴  When all my life was full of melody.
5278𓀴And I have looked and longed for their return,
5279𓀴  Nor thought but they would seem the same, to me.
5280𓀴
5281𓀴The fiery summer burned itself away,
5282𓀴  And from the hills, the golden autumn time
5283𓀴Looks down and smiles. The fields are tinged with brown--
5284𓀴  The birds are talking of another clime.
5285𓀴The forest trees are dyed in gorgeous hues,
5286𓀴  And weary ones have sought an earthy tomb.
5287𓀴But still the pain tugs fiercely at my heart--
5288𓀴  And still my life is wrapped in awful gloom.
5289𓀴
5290𓀴The winds I thought would cool my fevered brow,
5291𓀴  Are bleak, and dreary; and they bear no balm.
5292𓀴The sounds I thought would soothe my throbbing brain,
5293𓀴  Are grating discords; and they cannot calm
5294𓀴This inward tempest. Still, it rages on.
5295𓀴  My soul is tossed upon a troubled sea,
5296𓀴I find no pleasure in the olden joys--
5297𓀴  The autumn is not as it used to be.
5298𓀴
5299𓀴I hear the children shouting at their play!
5300𓀴  Their hearts are happy, and they know not pain.
5301𓀴To them the day brings sunlight, and no shade.
5302𓀴  And yet I would not be a child again.
5303𓀴For surely as the night succeeds the day.
5304𓀴  So surely will their mirth turn into tears.
5305𓀴And I would not return to happy hours,
5306𓀴  If I must live again these weary years.
5307𓀴
5308𓀴I would walk on, and leave it all behind:
5309𓀴  will walk on; and when my feet grow sore,
5310𓀴The boatman waits--his sails are all unfurled--
5311𓀴  He waits to row me to a fairer shore.
5312𓀴My tired limbs shall rest on beds of down,
5313𓀴  My tears shall all be wiped by Jesus' hand;
5314𓀴My soul shall know the peace it long hath sought--
5315𓀴  A peace too wonderful to understand.

5320𓀴_TWO LIVES_
5321𓀴
5322𓀴An infant lies in her cradle bed:
5323𓀴  The hands of sleep, on her eyelids fall.
5324𓀴The moments pass, with a noiseless tread,
5325𓀴  And the clock on the mantle counts them all.
5326𓀴The infant wakes, with a wailing cry,
5327𓀴But she does not heed, how her life slips by.
5328𓀴
5329𓀴A child is sporting, in careless play:
5330𓀴  She rivals the birds with her mellow song:
5331𓀴The clock, unheeded, ticks away,
5332𓀴  And counts the moments that drift along.
5333𓀴But the child is chasing the butterfly,
5334𓀴And she does not heed how her life drifts by.
5335𓀴
5336𓀴A maiden stands at her lover's side,
5337𓀴  In the tender light of the setting sun.
5338𓀴Onward and onward the moments glide,
5339𓀴  And the old clock counts them, one by one.
5340𓀴But the maiden's bridal is drawing nigh,
5341𓀴And she does not heed how her life drifts by.
5342𓀴
5343𓀴A song of her youth the matron sings,
5344𓀴  And she dreameth a dream, and her eye is wet.
5345𓀴And backward and forward the pendulum swings,
5346𓀴  In the clock that never has rested yet.
5347𓀴And the matron smothers a half-drawn sigh,
5348𓀴As she thinks how her life is drifting by.
5349𓀴
5350𓀴An old crone sits in her easy chair;
5351𓀴  Her head is dropped on her aged breast.
5352𓀴The clock on the mantle ticketh there--
5353𓀴  The clock that is longing now for rest.
5354𓀴And the old crone smiles, as the moments fly,
5355𓀴And thinks how her life is drifting by.
5356𓀴
5357𓀴A shrouded form, in a coffin bed--
5358𓀴  A waiting grave, in the fallow ground:
5359𓀴The moments pass with a noiseless tread,
5360𓀴  But the clock on the mantle makes no sound.
5361𓀴The lives of the two have gone for ay,
5362𓀴And they do not heed, how the time drifts by.

5367𓀴_IN MEMORIUM_
5368𓀴
5369𓀴(Miss Jennie Blanchard, aged 21 )
5370𓀴
5371𓀴Across the sodden field we gaze,
5372𓀴  To woodlands, painted gold and brown;
5373𓀴To hills that hide in purple haze,
5374𓀴  And proudly wear the autumn's crown.
5375𓀴Oh, lavish autumn! fair, we know,
5376𓀴And yet we cannot deem her so.
5377𓀴
5378𓀴The blossoms had their little day;
5379𓀴  The grasses, and the green-hung trees.
5380𓀴They lived, grew old, and passed away.
5381𓀴  And yet, not satisfied with these,
5382𓀴The cruel autumn could not pass
5383𓀴Without this last fell stroke: alas!
5384𓀴
5385𓀴"Alas," we cry, because God's ways
5386𓀴  Seem so at variance with our own,
5387𓀴And grieving through the nights and days,
5388𓀴  We see not that His love was shown
5389𓀴In gathering to the "Harvest Home,"
5390𓀴Our lost one, from the grief to come.
5391𓀴
5392𓀴Oh, Tears! she will not have to weep!
5393𓀴  Oh, Woes! she will not have to bear!
5394𓀴For her, who fell so soon asleep,
5395𓀴  No furrowed face, no whitened hair.
5396𓀴And yet _we_ would have given her _these_,
5397𓀴In lieu of heavenly victories.
5398𓀴
5399𓀴How weak the strongest mortal love!
5400𓀴  How selfish in its tenderness!
5401𓀴How God's angelic host above
5402𓀴  Must wonder at our blind distress!
5403𓀴_We_ see her still grave, dark and dim,
5404𓀴And _they_ see only Heaven and _Him_.
5405𓀴
5406𓀴Perpetual youth! oh, priceless boon!
5407𓀴  Forever youthful: never old!
5408𓀴How can we think she died too soon?
5409𓀴  What though life's story _was_ half told?
5410𓀴Wiser than all earth's seers, to-day,
5411𓀴Is this fair soul, that passed away.
5412𓀴
5413𓀴Magician, sage, philosopher,
5414𓀴  With all their vast brain-wealth combined,
5415𓀴Are only babes, compared with her:
5416𓀴  This soul, that left the "things behind,"
5417𓀴And, "reaching to the things before,"
5418𓀴Gained God, through Christ, forevermore.

5423𓀴_MY LOVE_
5424𓀴
5425𓀴My love is fair as the morn;
5426𓀴  Yes, fair as the summer morning,
5427𓀴When with fold on fold of red, and gold,
5428𓀴  The sun in the east gives warning,
5429𓀴And a soft, rare light, not dim nor bright,
5430𓀴  O'er hill and mountain lingers;
5431𓀴And flower, and vine with jewels shine--
5432𓀴  Bedecked by the fairie's fingers.
5433𓀴
5434𓀴My love has eyes like the clouds,
5435𓀴  That are dyed with the autumn's splendor,
5436𓀴So darkly blue, where her soul looks through--
5437𓀴  So truthful and so tender.
5438𓀴When their light is hid by the snowy lid,
5439𓀴  My heart seems lost in shadow.
5440𓀴And her glance will chase the gloom from my face,
5441𓀴  Like sunlight on a meadow.
5442𓀴
5443𓀴My love has cheeks like a rose--
5444𓀴  Yes, like a rose in blossom,
5445𓀴And a flake of snow is her polished brow,
5446𓀴  And a drift of snow is her bosom;
5447𓀴And her hair sweeps down, half gold, half brown,
5448𓀴  Like a silken veil, to cover
5449𓀴The matchless grace of her form and face,
5450𓀴  From the burning eyes of her lover.
5451𓀴
5452𓀴My love has a voice like a thrush--
5453𓀴  Yes, like a thrush when singing.
5454𓀴And the wondering lark cries, "Listen! hark!"
5455𓀴  When he hears her glad tone ringing.
5456𓀴Oh, she is fair, beyond compare;
5457𓀴  And how her sweet face flushes,
5458𓀴When I whisper low a tale we know--
5459𓀴  And the rose is shamed by her blushes.

5464𓀴_THE FROST FAIRY_
5465𓀴
5466𓀴All day the trees were moaning,
5467𓀴  For the leaves that they had lost.
5468𓀴All day they creaked and trembled,
5469𓀴  And the naked branches tossed,
5470𓀴And shivered in the north wind,
5471𓀴  As he hurried up and down,
5472𓀴Over hill-tops, bleak and cheerless,
5473𓀴  Over meadows, bare, and brown.
5474𓀴
5475𓀴"Oh, my green and tender leaflets.
5476𓀴  Oh, my fair buds, lost, and gone!"
5477𓀴So they moaned through all the daytime,
5478𓀴  So, they groaned, till night came on.
5479𓀴And the hoar-frost lurked, and listened,
5480𓀴  To the wailing, sad refrain.
5481𓀴And he whispered, "Wait--be patient--
5482𓀴  I will cover you again.
5483𓀴
5484𓀴"I will clothe you in new garments:
5485𓀴  I will deck you, ere the light,
5486𓀴In a sheen of spotless glory,
5487𓀴  In a robe of purest white.
5488𓀴You shall wear the matchless mantle,
5489𓀴  That the good frost-fairy weaves."
5490𓀴And the bare trees listened, wondered--
5491𓀴  And forgot their fallen leaves.
5492𓀴
5493𓀴And the quaint and silent fairy,
5494𓀴  Backward, forward, through the gloom,
5495𓀴Wove the matchless, glittering mantle;
5496𓀴  Spun the frost-thread, on her loom.
5497𓀴And the bare trees talked together--
5498𓀴  Talked in whispers, soft, and low,
5499𓀴As the good and patient fairy
5500𓀴  Moved her shuttle to and fro.
5501𓀴
5502𓀴And lo! when the sudden glory
5503𓀴  Of the morning crept abroad,
5504𓀴All the trees were clothed in grandeur;
5505𓀴  All the twiglets robed and shod
5506𓀴In the glittering, spotless garments,
5507𓀴  That the sunshine decked with gems;
5508𓀴And the trees forgot their sorrow,
5509𓀴  'Neath their robes and diadems.

5514𓀴_THE SUMMONS_
5515𓀴
5516𓀴I think the leaf would sooner
5517𓀴  Be the first to break away,
5518𓀴Than to hang alone in the orchard
5519𓀴  In the bleak November day.
5520𓀴And I think the fate of the flower
5521𓀴  That falls in the midst of bloom
5522𓀴Is sweeter than if it lingered
5523𓀴  To die in the autumn's gloom.
5524𓀴
5525𓀴Some glowing, golden morning
5526𓀴  In the heart of the summer time,
5527𓀴As I stand in the perfect vigor
5528𓀴  And strength of my youth's glad prime;
5529𓀴When my heart is light and happy,
5530𓀴  And the world seems bright to me,
5531𓀴I would like to drop from this earth-life,
5532𓀴  As a green leaf drops from the tree.
5533𓀴
5534𓀴Someday, when the golden glory
5535𓀴  Of June is over the earth,
5536𓀴And the birds are singing together
5537𓀴  In a wild, mad strain of mirth,
5538𓀴When the skies are as clear and cloudless
5539𓀴  As the skies of June can be,
5540𓀴I would like to have the summons
5541𓀴  Sent down from God to me.
5542𓀴
5543𓀴I would not wait for the furrows--
5544𓀴  For the faded eyes and hair;
5545𓀴But pass out swift and sudden,
5546𓀴  Ere I grow heart-sick with care;
5547𓀴I would break some morn in my singing--
5548𓀴  Or fall in my springing walk,
5549𓀴As a full-blown flower will sometimes
5550𓀴  Drop, all a-bloom, from the stalk.
5551𓀴
5552𓀴And so, in my youth's glad morning,
5553𓀴I would like to hear the summons,
5554𓀴  That must come, sometime, from God.
5555𓀴I would pass from the earth's perfection
5556𓀴  To the endless June above;
5557𓀴From the fullness of living and loving,
5558𓀴  To the noon of Immortal Love.

5564𓀴
5565𓀴Written upon Eva Orton's third birthday.
5566𓀴
5567𓀴A robin up in the linden-tree
5568𓀴  Merrily sings this lay:
5569𓀴"Somebody sweet is three years old--
5570𓀴  Three years old to-day."
5571𓀴Somebody's bright blue eyes look up
5572𓀴  Through tangled curls of gold,
5573𓀴And two red lips unclose to say--
5574𓀴  "To-day I am free years old."
5575𓀴
5576𓀴Clouds were over the sky this morn,
5577𓀴  But now they are sailing away;
5578𓀴Clouds could never obscure the sun
5579𓀴  On somebody sweet's birthday.
5580𓀴Bluest of skies and greenest of trees,
5581𓀴  Sunlight and birds and flowers,
5582𓀴These are Nature's birthday gifts
5583𓀴  To this sweet pet of ours.
5584𓀴
5585𓀴The pantry is brimming with cakes and creams
5586𓀴  For somebody's birthday ball.
5587𓀴Papa and mamma bring their gifts,
5588𓀴  But their _love_ is better than all.
5589𓀴Ribbons and sashes, and dainty robes,
5590𓀴  Gifts of silver and gold,
5591𓀴Will fade and rust as the days go by,
5592𓀴  But their _hearts_ will not grow cold.
5593𓀴
5594𓀴Then laugh in the sunlight, somebody sweet--
5595𓀴  Little flower of June!
5596𓀴You have nothing to do with care,
5597𓀴  For life is in perfect tune.
5598𓀴Loving hearts and sheltering arms
5599𓀴  Shall keep old care away
5600𓀴For many a year, from somebody sweet,
5601𓀴  Who is three years old to-day.

5606𓀴_THE DIFFERENCE_
5607𓀴
5608𓀴Up in the cozy chamber,
5609𓀴  Where, on the snowy bed
5610𓀴The dress, and the pearls, and the new false curls,
5611𓀴  For the morrow's use were spread,
5612𓀴The bride-elect and her mother
5613𓀴  Were sitting before the grate,
5614𓀴Talking over the days gone by,
5615𓀴  And planning the future state.
5616𓀴
5617𓀴"I really am quite well suited,"
5618𓀴  Said Minnie, "with my outfit--
5619𓀴Jane says Kit Somers trousseau,
5620𓀴  Is nothing compared with it.
5621𓀴That her laces are imitation,
5622𓀴  And her bonnet a perfect fright,
5623𓀴And she says I'll wholly eclipse her
5624𓀴  In everybody's sight.
5625𓀴
5626𓀴"And she isn't to make the tour,
5627𓀴  But only to visit awhile.
5628𓀴I declare I'd never be married
5629𓀴  If I couldn't do it in style.
5630𓀴Jane says her jewels, though splendid,
5631𓀴  With mine can never compare:
5632𓀴I tell you I do love Harry,
5633𓀴  When I look at this solitaire.
5634𓀴
5635𓀴"And I think he's a darling, mother,
5636𓀴  For he's going to let me board,
5637𓀴At least he will, he says, until
5638𓀴  He finds that he can afford
5639𓀴To purchase that house of Mosleys,
5640𓀴  That splendid brown stone front.
5641𓀴I wouldn't have anything humbler.
5642𓀴  And Harry says _he_ won't.
5643𓀴
5644𓀴"My presents are perfectly splendid,
5645𓀴  Much finer than Kit's, I know,
5646𓀴I think that's half of a wedding
5647𓀴  To have such things to show.
5648𓀴If we get that house of Mosleys,
5649𓀴  What a brilliant life we'll live.
5650𓀴Such people as I'll have throng it--
5651𓀴  Such parties as I will give.
5652𓀴
5653𓀴"I mean to just _queen it_, mother,
5654𓀴  In society everywhere,
5655𓀴And my title of Belle of the City
5656𓀴  I shall continue to wear.
5657𓀴I don't believe that a woman
5658𓀴  By marriage should be tied down
5659𓀴To wearing a smile for her husband
5660𓀴  And for all other men a frown.
5661𓀴
5662𓀴"I mean to dress better than ever,
5663𓀴  And be just as merry and free.
5664𓀴Children! the troublesome wretches!
5665𓀴  No ma'am, not any for me.
5666𓀴I know I'd be cross and unhappy,
5667𓀴  With children to tease, and annoy.
5668𓀴A joy, you say, to be mother,
5669𓀴  Well, I will be spared that joy."
5670𓀴
5671𓀴Across the hall in their bedroom
5672𓀴  A hale old couple sat,
5673𓀴Minnie's grandfather and mother,
5674𓀴  Having a good night chat.
5675𓀴"So, the last of the children is going,"
5676𓀴  Grandmother said, and sighed,
5677𓀴"Minnie, (we named her Mary,)
5678𓀴  To-morrow will be a bride.
5679𓀴
5680𓀴"It will be a great occasion,
5681𓀴  All glitter and glow and shine,
5682𓀴A nineteenth century wedding,
5683𓀴  Not much like yours, and mine.
5684𓀴A few good friends were with us,
5685𓀴  When we were married, John,
5686𓀴They came to see us united--
5687𓀴  Not to see what the bride had on.
5688𓀴
5689𓀴"I wore a snowy muslin,
5690𓀴  And a white rose in my hair,
5691𓀴No silks nor gems, nor diadems--
5692𓀴  And yet you thought me fair.
5693𓀴We stood in the broad cool kitchen,
5694𓀴  On the white and sanded floor,
5695𓀴And a breeze from the odorous orchard,
5696𓀴  Looked in at the open door.
5697𓀴
5698𓀴"The minister read the service
5699𓀴  That made us one for life,
5700𓀴And I was no longer a maiden
5701𓀴  But a loved and cherished wife.
5702𓀴You took me home on the morrow!
5703𓀴  Six miles, in a one-horse chaise;
5704𓀴Folks didn't race over the country
5705𓀴  'Touring' in those old days.
5706𓀴
5707𓀴"Our house was a tiny cabin
5708𓀴  That would just hold two, you said,
5709𓀴But ere a year, you found, my dear
5710𓀴  There was room for three, instead.
5711𓀴Ah me! that wonderful baby!
5712𓀴  'Twas a moment of perfect bliss
5713𓀴When I held up the pink faced darling
5714𓀴  For his father's tender kiss.
5715𓀴
5716𓀴"Then came a dear little daughter!
5717𓀴  And then more boys and girls
5718𓀴Till you built on a wing to the cabin
5719𓀴  To cover their sunny curls.
5720𓀴There was never a happier woman
5721𓀴  In all of the land I know,
5722𓀴Singing away at my labor--
5723𓀴  Watching the children grow.
5724𓀴
5725𓀴"I had my beaux and lovers,
5726𓀴  When I was a girl; but when
5727𓀴I became your bride I put aside
5728𓀴  All thoughts of other men.
5729𓀴Lover, and king, and husband,
5730𓀴  And friend, I found in you,
5731𓀴And you repaid my devotion,
5732𓀴  By being kind, and true.
5733𓀴
5734𓀴"Ah well! the world keeps changing
5735𓀴  And weddings have changed with the rest,
5736𓀴People go only to comment
5737𓀴  And see how the bride is drest.
5738𓀴Girls wed houses and titles
5739𓀴  Instead of men as of old,
5740𓀴And babies are out of the fashion
5741𓀴  And all that glitters is gold.
5742𓀴
5743𓀴"Perhaps these times are better,
5744𓀴  Though I cannot think them so,
5745𓀴But I am a poor old woman.
5746𓀴  And not supposed to know."
5747𓀴And grandmother finished her musings
5748𓀴  With a meaning shake of the head
5749𓀴Over nineteenth century folly.
5750𓀴  And sighed, and went to bed.

5755𓀴_LOVES EXTRAVAGANCE_
5756𓀴
5757𓀴Could I but measure my strength, by my love,
5758𓀴  Were I as strong, as my heart's love is true,
5759𓀴I would pull down the stars, from the heavens above,
5760𓀴  And weave them all into a garland for you.
5761𓀴And brighter, and better, your jewels should be
5762𓀴  Than any proud queen's, that e'r dwelt o'er the sea.
5763𓀴Ay! richer and rarer, your gems, love, should be
5764𓀴  Than any rare jewels that come from the sea.
5765𓀴
5766𓀴I would gather the beautiful, delicate green
5767𓀴  From the dress of the spring--with the heaven's soft blue,
5768𓀴And never from east land, to west land were seen
5769𓀴  Such wonderful robes, as I'd fashion for you.
5770𓀴And I'd snatch the bright rays of the sun in my hand
5771𓀴  And braid you a girdle, love, strand over strand.
5772𓀴Ay! one by one, catch the bright rays in my hand
5773𓀴  And braid them, and twine them, all strand over strand.
5774𓀴
5775𓀴I would gather the amber, the red and gold dyes,
5776𓀴  That glimmer and glow, in the autumn sunset,
5777𓀴And weave you a mantle; and pull from the skies
5778𓀴  The rainbow to trim it. Ah Love! never yet
5779𓀴Was any proud princess, from east to the west
5780𓀴  So peerlessly jeweled--so royally drest.
5781𓀴Never daughter of princes, in east land or west,
5782𓀴  So decked in rare jewels, so gorgeously drest.
5783𓀴
5784𓀴And I'd make you a vail, from the rare golden haze,
5785𓀴  That Indian Summer spreads over the lea.
5786𓀴And trim it with dew! Queens should envy and praise
5787𓀴  Your matchless apparel, ah darling, but see--
5788𓀴My strength is unequal to what I would do!
5789𓀴  I have only this little low cottage, for you.
5790𓀴Nay! I can not accomplish the thing I would do,
5791𓀴  And I've only this cot and a warm heart for you.

5796𓀴_YOU WILL FORGET ME_
5797𓀴
5798𓀴You will forget me: the years are so tender--
5799𓀴  They bind up the wounds which we think are so deep;
5800𓀴This dream of our youth will fade out as the splendor
5801𓀴  Fades from the sky, when the sun sinks to sleep:
5802𓀴The clouds of forgetfulness, over and over,
5803𓀴  Will banish the last rosy colors away;
5804𓀴And th' fingers of Time will weave garlands to cover
5805𓀴  The scar which you think is a life-mark to-day.
5806𓀴
5807𓀴You will forget me:--will thank me for saying
5808𓀴  The words which you think are so pointed with pain,
5809𓀴Time loves a new lay; and the dirge he is playing
5810𓀴  Will change for you soon to a livelier strain.
5811𓀴I shall pass from your life, I shall pass out forever,
5812𓀴  And the hours we have spent, will be sunk in the past.
5813𓀴Youth buries its dead: grief kills seldom, or never,
5814𓀴  And forgetfulness covers all sorrows at last.
5815𓀴
5816𓀴You will forget me; the one thing you covet
5817𓀴  Now, above all things will soon seem no prize:
5818𓀴And the heart which is not in your keeping, to prove it
5819𓀴  True or untrue, will lose worth in your eyes.
5820𓀴The one drop to-day, which you deem only wanting
5821𓀴  To make life a joy, will be lost in Time's stream;
5822𓀴You will forget; and the ghost that is haunting
5823𓀴  The aisles of your heart will pass out with the dream.

6094𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
6095𓀴
6096𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
6097𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
6098𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
6099𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
6100𓀴from people in all walks of life.
6101𓀴
6102𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
6103𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
6104𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
6105𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
6106𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
6107𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
6108𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
6109𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
6110𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

6127𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
6128𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
6129𓀴
6130𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
6131𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
6132𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
6133𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
6134𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
6135𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
6136𓀴status with the IRS.
6137𓀴
6138𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
6139𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
6140𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
6141𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
6142𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
6143𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
6144𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
6145𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
6146𓀴
6147𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
6148𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
6149𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
6150𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
6151𓀴
6152𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
6153𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
6154𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
6155𓀴
6156𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
6157𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
6158𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
6159𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

6161𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
6162𓀴
6163𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
6164𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
6165𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
6166𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
6167𓀴volunteer support.
6168𓀴
6169𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
6170𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
6171𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
6172𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
6173𓀴edition.
6174𓀴
6175𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
6176𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
6177𓀴
6178𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
6179𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
6180𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
6181𓀴subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
