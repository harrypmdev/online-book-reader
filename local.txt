130𓀴
131𓀴
132𓀴When Abbot Laurence, of Westminster, looked out to the northward or
133𓀴north-eastward, he could see no land—as far as the wall of London—which
134𓀴did not belong to him and his house. This was the Abbot who first had
135𓀴leave to assume the mitre, and in 1163 he obtained from Pope Alexander
136𓀴II. the canonisation of Edward the Confessor. When worshippers wished
137𓀴to kneel at the new saint’s shrine they had to reach Westminster as
138𓀴best they could. Some, especially those who lived at Charing, or
139𓀴further up the hill, in what was afterwards Hedge Lane, would make
140𓀴their way to the Thames, the best highway in those days. In some
141𓀴seasons, perhaps, the water-courses, which had their origin in the
142𓀴Tyburn, might be dry enough to let them pass, but there were as yet
143𓀴no regular roads and no bridges. One of these water-courses supplied
144𓀴the Abbey, and one ran out where Richmond Terrace is now. We have two
145𓀴documents from which to draw a picture of the ground which was not yet
146𓀴Whitehall. First, we have the evidence afforded by the geographical
147𓀴features of the locality; and, secondly, we have the report of a trial
148𓀴which took place some sixty years ago, when, no doubt, all possible
149𓀴charters and grants and leases and demises were cited. The trial was
150𓀴between the people of Westminster and the people who lived in Richmond
151𓀴Terrace. Westminster claimed that the Terrace was within the boundaries
152𓀴of St. Margaret. The Terrace claimed that it was extra-parochial, as
153𓀴being on part of the site of the palace of Whitehall. The counsel for
154𓀴Westminster was able to show that Whitehall had been private property
155𓀴before the reign of Henry VIII., and that neither he nor any one else
156𓀴had made it extra-parochial. The verdict, therefore, was in favour of
157𓀴the parishioners of St. Margaret.
158𓀴
159𓀴We may return to this interesting and instructive report, with its
160𓀴wealth of ancient evidence, and interrogate that much more ancient
161𓀴document, the face of the country. Strange to say, a great deal of
162𓀴that country remains as it was in, say, the reign of Henry III. The
163𓀴green fields and the water-courses are there, though the Abbot in 1250
164𓀴could no longer look across his own land all the way from Westminster.
165𓀴The divided Tyburn wandered over the green expanse, untroubled with
166𓀴bridges. Two or three small brooks formed here a kind of delta. On
167𓀴the south, one of them ran through Westminster Abbey and divided
168𓀴Thorney Island from Tot Hill. Another ran through the district we call
169𓀴Whitehall. The land between was low and marshy, and even at the present
170𓀴day, when there has been so much levelling up, the statue of Charles I.
171𓀴is upon ground ten feet higher than Parliament Street. If, standing on
172𓀴the future site of Whitehall we looked to the westward, we saw nothing
173𓀴but a vast tract of low green meadow-land. If we looked to the south,
174𓀴we might have seen the new buildings of Westminster Abbey, unless when
175𓀴the Danes had been on the warpath. If we looked to the eastward, we
176𓀴found that the Thames washed up close to our feet.
177𓀴
178𓀴At this early period, and down to the reign of King Edward I., there
179𓀴were no houses in sight, except those which clustered about the
180𓀴Abbey, those which constituted the village of Charing, and in the far
181𓀴distance the grim walls, the red-tiled roofs, and the church towers
182𓀴of the City. London was more plainly visible than it is now, and on
183𓀴account of a curious bend in the course of the Thames, was nearly as
184𓀴visible from Westminster. By the thirteenth century a great change had
185𓀴come over all the district. The Thames was better confined within its
186𓀴proper limits; some measure of embanking had been carried out, and a
187𓀴great many alterations in City life, in Church arrangements, and in
188𓀴the King’s policy have been detailed in the histories of London. We
189𓀴need not go far into them here. Before 1200, all the land between the
190𓀴Abbot and London belonged to him. By 1222 all was changed, or about
191𓀴to be changed, and the Abbot owned nothing except the advowson of the
192𓀴far-off St. Bride’s. St. Bride’s belongs to Westminster even now. The
193𓀴King laid claim to certain foreshores on the banks of the Thames.
194𓀴Undoubtedly, they belonged by an ancient grant to the Abbot, but we
195𓀴must take into consideration that what had been only occasionally dry
196𓀴land in the eleventh century was permanently dry in the thirteenth;
197𓀴and the King had conferred, and was conferring, too many benefits on
198𓀴the Abbot and his monks and their church to permit them to dispute
199𓀴his royal, if illegal, pleasure. The Bishop of Exeter formed a little
200𓀴estate of the Outer Temple. From his precincts westward the constant
201𓀴embanking, and especially the formation of the roadway of the Strand,
202𓀴left a wide strip now permanently dry. This strip the King erected
203𓀴into a manor, and bestowed upon his wife’s uncle, Count Peter. Peter
204𓀴became Count of Savoy in 1263, and the manor has ever since been called
205𓀴after him. The next of these reclamations was Whitehall. In the lawsuit
206𓀴already mentioned, a document was produced which threw great light on
207𓀴the early history of the district. It relates to the sale by Roger de
208𓀴Ware and Maud, his mother, to Hubert de Burgh, of their land here.
209𓀴Another document was a similar sale by Odo, the King’s goldsmith, of an
210𓀴adjoining plot, identified as stretching from the highway to the Thames.
211𓀴
212𓀴Hubert’s choice of a residence was determined, no doubt, because it
213𓀴placed him within easy reach of the city on one side, and of the King’s
214𓀴palace on the other. He probably seldom used the road through the
215𓀴newly-constructed King Street, or the other road through the Strand—a
216𓀴road famous for ruts and mud. He went either to Westminster or to
217𓀴London by water, as did his great neighbours in the Savoy, and the
218𓀴bishops who had palaces outside the Bar of the Temple. We often wonder
219𓀴why our ancestors preferred these low-lying places for their houses.
220𓀴The answer is the difficulty they experienced in locomotion by land.
221𓀴The “silent highway” of the Thames was such a convenience that all who
222𓀴could possibly afford it preferred to be within easy reach of water.
223𓀴
224𓀴Hubert had no easy part to play. From 1227 he had to do daily battle
225𓀴with the young King, who already, though still a boy, showed signs
226𓀴of the combined obstinacy and incompetence which characterised him
227𓀴through life. Hubert saw the impolicy of yielding to the papal claims.
228𓀴He followed, as Bishop Stubbs remarks, in the footsteps of William
229𓀴Marshall, taking a middle path between the feudal designs of the great
230𓀴nobles and the despotic theories of the late King. In both these
231𓀴particulars he was in opposition to Henry, who was bound to the Pope by
232𓀴his education, and to the retrograde party by his personal prejudices.
233𓀴Hubert served the King too well to please the people, and spared the
234𓀴people too much to satisfy Henry. In 1232 he was dismissed, and his
235𓀴ungrateful master, not content with his dismissal, trumped up a series
236𓀴of charges against him, just as Henry’s descendant, Henry VIII., did
237𓀴with regard to Cardinal Wolsey. Hubert had been made Earl of Kent in
238𓀴1227, and Constable of the Tower of London just before his disgrace—in
239𓀴fact, only a few days before—and during the same month was himself
240𓀴lodged in the Tower as a prisoner. Eventually his lands were restored,
241𓀴but he was not allowed to leave his castle at Devizes; he survived
242𓀴till 1243, when he died, as Matthew Paris relates, “full of days.” He
243𓀴had been five times married, and reckoned among his wives the widow of
244𓀴King John, and the sister of Alexander III., king of Scotland; but he
245𓀴left only two children, John, his son, and Margaret, his daughter. The
246𓀴subsequent history of the land now called Whitehall, so far as Hubert
247𓀴was interested in it, may be briefly detailed. Hubert had made a vow
248𓀴to go to the Holy Land and fight the infidel, being himself, as Roger
249𓀴of Wendover says, _Miles strenuus_; but not being able to fulfil his
250𓀴vow, he gave his land at Whitehall, which he describes as being in the
251𓀴parish of St. Margaret’s, into the hands of trustees to be sold in aid
252𓀴of an expedition to the Holy Land. The trustees promptly sold it to
253𓀴Walter Grey, archbishop of York, who annexed it to his See. Walter died
254𓀴in 1255, and was succeeded by Sewall Bovill, who had been Dean of York.
255𓀴Thirty archbishops in all held this house, beginning with Walter Grey
256𓀴and ending with Thomas Wolsey. It is curious to remark that no trace
257𓀴now exists of their occasional residence. It was uniformly called York
258𓀴House, and we may be sure that Wolsey improved it, and built a hall
259𓀴and a chapel similar to those at Hampton Court. One or two old views
260𓀴show us stately and lofty buildings in the half-Gothic, half-Italian
261𓀴style, which is so familiar at Christ Church at Oxford, and at King’s
262𓀴College at Cambridge. A large hall was in King Street; that is, outside
263𓀴Holbein’s Gate. We see it beyond the gate in Silvestre’s view; and
264𓀴it stands up dark and heavy, with its strong buttresses on the left
265𓀴hand, in T. Sandby’s view. In the last century, when it had been part
266𓀴of the Treasury buildings for generations, it was newly fronted in
267𓀴stone, and the buttresses turned into pilasters. Since then it has been
268𓀴refronted twice—by Soane in 1824, and by Barry in 1846. Barry greatly
269𓀴increased the length. It would be interesting, but almost impossible,
270𓀴to ascertain if any of the masonry of Wolsey’s building still remains
271𓀴within the new walls.
272𓀴
273𓀴This is, of course, a digression. No part of the Treasury is in
274𓀴Whitehall; but the reason for mentioning it is that its inclusion in
275𓀴the two engravings I have named shows us what, in all probability,
276𓀴Wolsey’s other buildings were like. Paul Hentzner, writing in the
277𓀴reign of Queen Elizabeth, says that they were “truly royal.” Very
278𓀴little building of any importance went on under Henry VIII. or his
279𓀴three immediate successors, so that Hentzner’s allusion must be to
280𓀴what Wolsey left. It is true, as we shall see, that Henry proposed to
281𓀴improve and extend it; but we may rest certain that he added nothing
282𓀴to its magnificence, if we except the gates; as the anonymous author
283𓀴of _Dodsley_ remarks, he had a greater taste for pleasure than for
284𓀴elegance of building, and immediately on entering upon possession he
285𓀴ordered a tennis court, a cockpit, and a series of bowling-greens.
286𓀴
287𓀴But we are going too fast. In the beginning of 1530 Cardinal Wolsey
288𓀴was still in possession, and there are various accounts of how he
289𓀴transferred the palace of his predecessors to the King. Henry was not
290𓀴very scrupulous in matters of this kind. He was much given to breaking
291𓀴the tenth commandment, and especially to coveting his neighbour’s
292𓀴house. He had already helped himself to Hampton Court, and a curious
293𓀴anecdote will be found in Thorne’s _Environs_. Lord Windsor was much
294𓀴attached to his place at Stanwell, which had descended to him from
295𓀴a long line of ancestors. The house, no doubt, was in what agents
296𓀴nowadays call ornamental repair. He entertained the King royally, and
297𓀴Henry, with the kind of gratitude peculiar to him, promptly commanded
298𓀴him to hand it over. He gave in exchange the Manor of Bordesley and
299𓀴the Abbey, which Henry had taken from the monks. Windsor had just laid
300𓀴in a stock of provisions for his Christmas festivities, but he refused
301𓀴to remove them, saying that the King should not find it bare Stanwell
302𓀴when he came to take possession. The curious part of the story is
303𓀴that Henry does not seem ever to have visited it again, and we know
304𓀴that he soon afterwards leased it away. At the time of Wolsey’s fall,
305𓀴Henry had been for several years almost without a home in London;
306𓀴his apartments at Westminster were burnt in 1512, and after twenty
307𓀴years, in 1532, he bought the hospital of St. James’s-in-the-Fields.
308𓀴Between these dates he would have been without a London palace, except
309𓀴the Tower or Bridewell, but on the fall of Cardinal Wolsey certain
310𓀴illegal formalities were complied with, and Henry became possessed
311𓀴of Whitehall. The gates north and south of the royal precincts were
312𓀴needful on account of the old right of way between Charing—now become
313𓀴Charing Cross—and Westminster; and in 1535 Henry built the church of
314𓀴St. Martin, near to where the royal mews had been from time immemorial,
315𓀴with a view to prevent the constant passage of funerals from the
316𓀴northern to the southern part of St. Margaret’s.
317𓀴
318𓀴In addition, Henry acquired all the land between Charing Cross and
319𓀴an outlying suburb of Westminster known as Little Cales, or Calais.
320𓀴More than this, he annexed all the green to the westward, which I have
321𓀴already mentioned. Abbot Islip had, in fact, nothing left of the great
322𓀴manor which after the Conquest had belonged to Westminster Abbey. The
323𓀴City of London had acquired the great ward of Farringdon Without. The
324𓀴lawyers had the Inner and Middle Temples. The King had inherited from
325𓀴the wife of John of Gaunt all the manor of the Savoy. And now Henry
326𓀴VIII. helped himself to the remainder.

332𓀴It will be interesting to see the document by which the Abbot conveyed
333𓀴the inheritance of his house to the King. I am tempted to quote it
334𓀴nearly whole, but recommend the reader who is not interested in such
335𓀴things to skip on. No more quotations of the kind occur in this little
336𓀴book, but some readers may find the numerous landmarks enumerated worth
337𓀴making a note of, as most of them have long been obliterated:—

400𓀴
401𓀴Had Henry foreseen the course which his policy of confiscation would
402𓀴lead him into, he might have waited till 1539, when all the monastic
403𓀴estates became his. However, there is much to interest us is this
404𓀴strange document. We see that when Henry had annexed Whitehall to
405𓀴Westminster in such a way as to call the two by the same name—that
406𓀴is, “our palace of Westminster;” and when he had annexed the whole
407𓀴expanse of St. James’s Park, to both, and had made of St. James’s a
408𓀴kind of lodge to Whitehall—when from St. James’s he could look up
409𓀴the green hills towards Hyde Park, which he had also taken from the
410𓀴Abbot of Westminster, and beyond that again towards Hampstead Hill—the
411𓀴intervening country being all open and void—he took special leave from
412𓀴a subservient Parliament to make the whole into “an honour.” “Forasmuch
413𓀴as the King’s most royal Majesty is most desirous to have the games
414𓀴of hare, partridge, pheasant, and heron preserved in and about his
415𓀴honour at his palace of Westminster, for his own disport and pastime
416𓀴to St. Giles’s-in-the-Fields, to our Lady of the Oak, to Highgate; to
417𓀴Hornsey Park; to Hampstead Heath; and from thence to his said palace of
418𓀴Westminster, to be preserved and kept for his own disport, pleasure and
419𓀴recreation; his highness therefore straightly chargeth and commandeth
420𓀴all and singular his subjects, of what estate, degree or condition
421𓀴soever they be, that they, nor any of them, do presume or attempt to
422𓀴hunt, or to hawk, or in any means to take, or kill, any of the said
423𓀴games, within the precincts aforesaid, as they tender his favour and
424𓀴will eschew the imprisonment of their bodies, and further punishment,
425𓀴at his Majesties will and pleasure.”
426𓀴
427𓀴Henry spent considerable sums of money in making an orchard, probably
428𓀴where the so-called Whitehall Gardens are now. Two thousand five
429𓀴hundred loads of stone were used in this work and in enclosing St.
430𓀴James’s Park. But the only additions to Wolsey’s building seem to have
431𓀴been a long gallery which ran northward towards Charing Cross; there
432𓀴was also a passage, but of what kind we do not know, “through a certain
433𓀴ground named Scotland.”
434𓀴
435𓀴There are numerous engravings extant of the northern gateway. It was
436𓀴in the most florid taste of the day. Perhaps we can best realise its
437𓀴appearance by a visit to Hampton Court. The great gate there is made of
438𓀴ornamental brickwork and decorated with terra-cotta statues or busts.
439𓀴Thomas Sandby’s drawing shows the view from King Street very well.
440𓀴On our left are the buildings of the Treasury. To the right beyond
441𓀴the gate is the Banqueting House. Apparently when this view was taken
442𓀴the gate had become wholly detached from what remained of the palace
443𓀴after the fire of 1697. Wilkinson’s view (I. 143), from a drawing by
444𓀴Hollar, taken in the early part of the reign of Charles I., shows a
445𓀴line of four gables connecting the gate and the Banqueting House, and
446𓀴we know that a gallery or passage led from the park, through the first
447𓀴floor of the gate to the palace. By this circuitous route it was that
448𓀴Charles reached the place of his death. In Hollar’s view the arch of
449𓀴the gate contains a flat ceiling and a window, which greatly spoils
450𓀴its appearance. At the park end of the passage there was a staircase.
451𓀴Adjoining this end of the passage, and very near where Downing Street
452𓀴stands now, was a tilt-yard, and close to it a small barrack for the
453𓀴Foot Guards. Beyond it, further to the north, was the yard of the Horse
454𓀴Guards, very much as it is still. Behind the spot where James I. built
455𓀴the Banqueting House, to the eastward, was the court, a very irregular
456𓀴space, divided by a passage passing over an archway. This passage led
457𓀴to the great hall and the chapel, which last was close to the river’s
458𓀴bank. The King’s lodgings also looked on the Thames, but between them
459𓀴and the chapel there was a labyrinth of small chambers and sets of
460𓀴chambers. To the westward of these small and inconvenient apartments,
461𓀴some of which were appropriated for the Queen and her maids of honour,
462𓀴was the great Stone Gallery, which looked on the garden and the bowling
463𓀴green. How far these arrangements were due to Cardinal Wolsey and how
464𓀴far to Henry VIII. we cannot say. Undoubtedly, the whole palace was
465𓀴most inconvenient, even at that day, when men’s ideas of comfort were
466𓀴so different from ours. There was not, if we except the so-called Great
467𓀴Hall, a very small building compared with that of Hampton Court, a
468𓀴single large or handsome chamber in the whole place. Room was, however,
469𓀴found for a library, and Paul Hentzner mentions it with praise. In it
470𓀴he saw a book in French written by the Princess, afterwards Queen,
471𓀴Elizabeth, with her own hand, and inscribed to her father: _Elizabeth
472𓀴sa très humble fille rend salut et obédience_. “All these books,”
473𓀴continues Hentzner, “are bound in velvet of different colours, though
474𓀴chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls and
475𓀴precious stones set in their bindings.” There are probably a few
476𓀴representatives of this library among the books which belonged to Henry
477𓀴VIII., and have his name or arms, in the British Museum. Hentzner also
478𓀴notices the furniture of inlaid woods, some stained glass representing
479𓀴the Passion, and a gallery of portraits and other pictures. He visited
480𓀴Whitehall in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the place must have
481𓀴been very much as it was left by Henry VIII. He mentions, among other
482𓀴things, the Queen’s bed, “ingeniously composed of woods of different
483𓀴colours, with quilts of silk, velvet, gold, silver, and embroidery.”
484𓀴Among the portraits is one, the description of which puzzles me: “A
485𓀴picture of King Edward VI., representing at first sight something quite
486𓀴deformed, till by looking through a small hole in the cover, which is
487𓀴put over it, you see it in its true proportions.” Can this have been a
488𓀴device of the same sort as the distorted skull in Holbein’s picture of
489𓀴“The Ambassadors” in the National Gallery?

496𓀴
497𓀴Henry VIII. continued to date documents of all kinds at “Westminster,”
498𓀴meaning Whitehall. It is possible that St. James’s was similarly
499𓀴included in Westminster. In or about 1537 the King’s house there
500𓀴was greatly improved and beautified, it is said by Cromwell, in
501𓀴anticipation of Henry’s marriage with Anne of Cleves. The initials
502𓀴“H. A.” on some of the fireplaces and ceilings were probably put up
503𓀴in allusion to the same marriage, and have nothing to do with Anne
504𓀴Boleyn. It was intended that Henry and Anne (of Cleves) should pass
505𓀴their honeymoon at this remote corner of the park as it was then,
506𓀴there being no buildings whatever visible from the gate. The result
507𓀴we all know; and Henry, long before the honeymoon had waned, was back
508𓀴at “Westminster.” Events travelled rapidly in those days. Anne Boleyn
509𓀴was beheaded in May, 1536. In the same month Henry was married to Jane
510𓀴Seymour. She died in October, 1537. In January, 1539, Henry married
511𓀴Anne of Cleves, and divorced her in July. In April following Cromwell
512𓀴became Earl of Essex, and was beheaded in July of the same year. No
513𓀴doubt Whitehall was the principal scene of the long tragedy indicated
514𓀴by this dry list of dates. At “Westminster” Henry conferred a peerage
515𓀴on Cromwell’s son, Gregory; and there, too, he issued letters of
516𓀴naturalisation to the Lady Anne of Cleves, and gave her several manors.
517𓀴One more tragedy and we have done with Henry VIII. On a day unknown, in
518𓀴January, 1547, the King lay dying at Whitehall. So weak had he become
519𓀴that he was obliged to leave it to others to execute his cruel and
520𓀴relentless orders. He died at Whitehall on the 28th, the last act of
521𓀴his life having been to send the poet Surrey to the scaffold, and to
522𓀴prepare a similar fate for Surrey’s father, the Duke of Norfolk. The
523𓀴Duke being a peer, the process for obtaining an act of attainder was
524𓀴slower. A commission had been issued by the tyrant to Wriothesley, St.
525𓀴John, Russell, and Hertford to give the King’s consent to the Bill. But
526𓀴death stepped in and the Duke’s life was saved.

531𓀴
532𓀴Sandford gives a very circumstantial account of the funeral ceremonies
533𓀴at the burial of Henry VIII. It is chiefly interesting because he names
534𓀴several apartments of Whitehall Palace. At first the body lay in the
535𓀴King’s private chamber, and there received some embalming treatment,
536𓀴and was wrapped in lead. The chapel, the cloister, the hall, and the
537𓀴King’s chamber were all hung with black. On the 2nd of February the
538𓀴coffin was taken into the chapel. We read of cloth of gold and a pall
539𓀴of tissue. The altar was covered with velvet, adorned with scutcheons
540𓀴of the Royal arms. Twelve lords, mourners, sat or knelt within the
541𓀴rail. Watchers likewise took turns of duty, and, as the people passed
542𓀴by, a herald cried to them, saying, “You shall of your charity pray for
543𓀴the soul of the most famous prince, King Henry VIII., our late most
544𓀴gracious king and master.” The body was not to lie in the sumptuous
545𓀴but despoiled chapel Henry had raised for his father and mother. On
546𓀴the 14th of February the wax effigy was ready, and a procession, which
547𓀴Sandford says was four miles long, started for Windsor. Henry had
548𓀴desired to be buried beside Jane Seymour. Syon was reached the first
549𓀴night, and the journey was ended at one o’clock the next day.
550𓀴
551𓀴There is nothing to connect Edward VI. with Whitehall during his short
552𓀴reign. But Mary, his successor, was constantly there. She is said to
553𓀴have preferred St. James’s, and the first separate mention we have of
554𓀴it in a State paper is in December, 1556. She died there in November,
555𓀴1558.
556𓀴
557𓀴Elizabeth made much use of Whitehall, but her buildings and
558𓀴improvements at Windsor must have proved a powerful attraction. She
559𓀴went about a good deal, and her State papers are signed in a great
560𓀴variety of places. She left no mark on Whitehall, although, at the
561𓀴very end of her reign, instead of Henry the Eighth’s “palace of
562𓀴Westminster,” we have “Whitehall,” pure and simple, one or twice. We
563𓀴have seen how York Place became the Palace of Westminster. How it again
564𓀴changed its name, and became Whitehall, we do not know. The change
565𓀴seems to have been made by Elizabeth shortly before her death, and
566𓀴the name may have already been in popular use. After her death, at
567𓀴Richmond, in March, 1603, her body lay in state at Whitehall, and was
568𓀴buried in the Chapel of Henry VII.
569𓀴

581𓀴
582𓀴The accession of the Stuarts marks a new epoch in the history of
583𓀴Whitehall. In spite of edicts against building, Charing Cross had
584𓀴become a populous place, and one of James’s first acts had been to
585𓀴build new stabling and a barn in the Mews on the site now occupied by
586𓀴Trafalgar Square. North-east of Whitehall, the Strand had become a
587𓀴continuous street, which ended with what we remember as Northumberland
588𓀴House, then called Northampton House, and subsequently Suffolk House.
589𓀴South of the palace, King Street had also been completed, and in a
590𓀴house there Edmund Spenser, the poet, died “for lake of bread,” as
591𓀴Ben Jonson reports. He “refused 20 pieces sent to him by my lord of
592𓀴Essex, and said he was sorrie he had no time to spend them.” East of
593𓀴King Street, where now we see Mr. Norman Shaw’s fine police office
594𓀴and Richmond Terrace, were green fields and gardens sloping to the
595𓀴Thames. The curious old Gothic gate made an entrance to King Street,
596𓀴and stood just at right angles to where we see the chief entrance to
597𓀴the Foreign and India Offices. The Palace garden, with its sun-dial
598𓀴lawn, was separated from the King Street slopes by the Bowling Green,
599𓀴where is now the house of the Duke of Buccleuch. On the other side of
600𓀴the roadway of Whitehall, beyond, that is to the northward of, the
601𓀴Tilt Yard and Horse Guards, Sir William Knollys, who was Treasurer of
602𓀴the Household to Queen Elizabeth, built himself a house to be near the
603𓀴Court. James I. made him a peer, as Lord Knollys, in 1603. In 1616 he
604𓀴became Viscount Wallingford, and his house long bore this name. Ten
605𓀴years later he was advanced to the earldom of Banbury, and died in
606𓀴1632. There were complications as to his marriage, in 1606, with Lady
607𓀴Elizabeth Howard, and his titles have been claimed unsuccessfully, at
608𓀴intervals ever since, by his reputed descendants. We shall have more to
609𓀴say about Wallingford House presently.
610𓀴
611𓀴[Illustration: _The King Street Gate_.
612𓀴
613𓀴_From the Engraving by_ G. VERTUE, 1725.]
614𓀴
615𓀴The new King must have looked on Whitehall as but a poor lodging.
616𓀴The Queen had Somerset House, between the Strand and the Thames, for
617𓀴her separate residence, and the Prince of Wales had St. James’s.
618𓀴To be more accurate, we may quote Mr. Sheppard to the effect that,
619𓀴though St. James’s was granted to Prince Henry the year after the
620𓀴King’s accession, he did not go into residence there for six years.
621𓀴Two years later he died. It is worth while to go into these things,
622𓀴because, among the four hundred persons and personages who composed the
623𓀴Prince’s train, was a “surveyor,” or, as we should say, an architect,
624𓀴named Inigo Jones, reputed to be a great traveller, but more in vogue
625𓀴at Court as a “devyser of maskes.” He had three shillings a day for
626𓀴his pay, and the Prince gave him as much as thirty pounds on one
627𓀴occasion (which, as Cunningham, his biographer, remarks, was equal to
628𓀴one hundred and twenty pounds of our money), and sixteen pounds on
629𓀴another. When the Prince died, Jones, who had a promise of the Royal
630𓀴Surveyorship at the next vacancy, went to Italy, no doubt to study,
631𓀴having probably saved something during his two years at St. James’s.
632𓀴
633𓀴There are many notices of masks performed before the King’s Majesty
634𓀴at Whitehall in the early years of the new dynasty. These plays took
635𓀴place in the Hall, which, as we have seen, was near the Chapel in the
636𓀴eastern part of the palace. It must have been small and inconvenient
637𓀴for such purposes, but Inigo, who on many occasions is mentioned as
638𓀴having looked after the arrangements, was fertile in resource, and
639𓀴made the most of the space at his disposal. He was destined to furnish
640𓀴the palace with an adequate hall, which is now the sole relic of the
641𓀴old royal residence existing. It is quite worth while to quote (from
642𓀴Cunningham) Jones’s account of one of these plays. It was written
643𓀴by Chapman, and was acted by the gentlemen of the Middle Temple and
644𓀴Lincoln’s Inn at the time of the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth
645𓀴with the Palsgrave, afterwards King of Bohemia. First, a procession
646𓀴started from the Rolls House in Chancery Lane, and rode on horseback
647𓀴along the Strand, past Charing Cross, to the Tilt-Yard at Whitehall,
648𓀴where they made one turn before the King, and then dismounted. The
649𓀴performance took place in the Hall. It is described as having for
650𓀴scenery an artificial rock, nearly as high as the roof. The rock was
651𓀴honeycombed with caves, and there were two winding stairs. The rock
652𓀴turned a golden colour, and “was run quite through with veins of gold.”
653𓀴On one side was a silver edifice labelled in Latin, “The Temple of
654𓀴Honour” (_Honoris Fanum_). There were various allusive devices, and
655𓀴after Plutus, the God of Riches, had made a speech, the rock split
656𓀴in pieces with a great crack, and Capriccio stepped out to make his
657𓀴speech while the broken rock vanished. Next appeared a cloud. Then a
658𓀴gold mine, in which the twelve masquers were triumphantly seated. Over
659𓀴the gold mine was an evening sky, and the red sun was seen to set.
660𓀴There were white cliffs in the background, and from them rose a bank of
661𓀴clouds, which hid everything. The mask cost Lincoln’s Inn alone more
662𓀴than a thousand pounds. Of course, scenery of the kind described must
663𓀴have been extremely costly, the designer having neither the appliances
664𓀴nor the skilled workmen who carry out such marvellous scenic effects in
665𓀴our modern theatres.
666𓀴
667𓀴One more example of Inigo’s powers as a “devyser” may be quoted from
668𓀴Cunningham. In 1611, in January, the Prince, then nearly at the end of
669𓀴his short life, presented a mask at Court, that is, at Whitehall. It
670𓀴was written by Ben Jonson, and called “Oberon, the Fairy Prince.” It
671𓀴cost 289_l._ 8_s._ 5_d._ for mercery, 298_l._ 15_s._ 6_d._ for silk,
672𓀴and 143_l._ 13_s._ 6_d._ for tailor’s work; in all, the Prince had to
673𓀴pay 1092_l._ 6_s._ 10_d._ The interest of these details lies in the
674𓀴fact that it was by making stage scenery that Inigo Jones was taught
675𓀴how to extract the greatest amount of effect from the smallest amount
676𓀴of material or means. It let him into the secret of proportion, and
677𓀴the marvellous amount of influence proportion alone, without ornament
678𓀴or expense, can be brought to exercise. Other men at that time also
679𓀴understood stage scenery, but stage scenery was to them nothing more.
680𓀴The information so gained fell on fertile soil in the mind of Inigo,
681𓀴and brought forth eventually those splendid architectural designs for
682𓀴which he can never be too much praised.
683𓀴
684𓀴Inigo Jones carried the information and experience thus obtained with
685𓀴him on this his second visit to Italy. He enquired why such a building
686𓀴had such an effect. He made careful measurements, and compared and
687𓀴combined the figures so arrived at until he wrung the secret of the old
688𓀴Roman builder from the ruins. Cunningham dwells at some length on this
689𓀴subject. There can be no doubt that, like Wren’s, the genius of Jones
690𓀴consisted mainly in his extraordinary power of taking pains. Where
691𓀴one man was content to observe the completeness and harmony of some
692𓀴palace or church, Jones must find out to what cause that harmony was
693𓀴due. Thus he went about making measurements. For instance, he always
694𓀴carried a copy of the great work of Andrea Palladio with him wherever
695𓀴he went. On the fly-leaves he constantly wrote such notes as this:—“The
696𓀴length of the great courte at Windsour is 350ᶠᵒ, the breadth is 260;
697𓀴this I measured by paces the 5 of December, 1690. The great court
698𓀴at Theobalds is 159ᶠᵒ, the second court is 110ᶠᵒ square, the thirde
699𓀴courte is 88ᶠᵒ—the 20 of June, 1621.” The book is now at Worcester
700𓀴College, Oxford. One of his notes is very curious as showing his subtle
701𓀴analysis of proportion. He had a great admiration for the Temple of
702𓀴Jupiter at Rome, and set seriously to work to find out the reason for
703𓀴its satisfactory effect. In the result he came to the conclusion that
704𓀴its design was based on a series of circles, and that its proportions
705𓀴were fixed by dividing the largest diameter into six parts, and then
706𓀴recombining them. In June, 1639, he noted of this temple that it had
707𓀴just been destroyed by the Pope’s permission for the sake of the marble
708𓀴built into the walls. The Bishops of London have here ancient precedent
709𓀴for their treatment of Wren’s City churches, and what Inigo would
710𓀴have thought of some recent doings may be gathered from the next two
711𓀴notes:—“This was the noblest thing which was in Rome in my time. So as
712𓀴all the good of the ancients will be ruined ere long.”
713𓀴
714𓀴On the 1st of October, 1615, he was put in possession of the office
715𓀴of Surveyor to the King, which had been promised him before he left
716𓀴England. His predecessor, Simon Basil, had died in that year, and we
717𓀴cannot doubt that he immediately commenced the series of designs by
718𓀴which it was intended to transform the shabby rabbit-warren, that, as
719𓀴we have seen, the so-called Palace of Whitehall had become. Otherwise,
720𓀴it is impossible to believe that when, in 1619, the old hall of which I
721𓀴have so often spoken, was destroyed by fire, he was ready within six
722𓀴months to begin the building of the Banqueting House. We must remember
723𓀴that this house, which is so familiar to all Londoners, was part of a
724𓀴design intended to cover a space of 1152 feet by 874. It was expected
725𓀴to rival the great palaces of the continental kings. The Vatican may
726𓀴be said to have been completed in 1588, and the smaller palace of
727𓀴the Lateran in 1586. At that time the largest of these palaces was
728𓀴the Escurial in Spain, which had been completed late in the previous
729𓀴century. The front is more than 680 feet in length. Versailles had not
730𓀴been begun, and neither had the largest of all, the palace of Mafra, on
731𓀴the west coast of Portugal, not far from Lisbon.
732𓀴
733𓀴Mafra is 760 feet in width, east and west. It forms at the present day
734𓀴a conspicuous, but not beautiful, object from the deck of the passing
735𓀴steamer, but is seldom visited, as it has nothing except its vast size
736𓀴to recommend it. But the palace of Whitehall was designed by Inigo
737𓀴Jones to be both larger than any other, and also so beautiful that
738𓀴even the little fragment with which we are familiar has challenged the
739𓀴admiration of every one who has any architectural taste for more than
740𓀴two hundred and fifty years.

745𓀴
746𓀴When the fire in Whitehall Palace took place, it did not require that
747𓀴the King should summon Jones to repair the damage. Any work of that
748𓀴kind was part of his daily round: but two interesting points should be
749𓀴mentioned here. Inigo made no attempt to restore the burnt building,
750𓀴nor did he undertake, as a modern architect would have done, to make a
751𓀴new hall, and persuade his employers that it was exactly as Cardinal
752𓀴Wolsey had left it. On the contrary, he offered the King plans of
753𓀴which the Banqueting House was but a small part. Evidently he had
754𓀴carefully examined the site, and found that there was ample room for
755𓀴a building on the greatest possible scale. The palace as it then was,
756𓀴reached from the very bank of the Thames to the roadway of Whitehall;
757𓀴and, on the western side, looking into the park, there was a kind of
758𓀴village of buildings attached to the palace more or less slightly.
759𓀴The whole space available was about 4000 feet from north to south,
760𓀴and 1300 from east to west. On the side of the park the space was
761𓀴practically inexhaustible; the King could take as much as he pleased
762𓀴in that direction. We shall give some description of the whole design
763𓀴presently. Jones within six months was ready to begin upon his new
764𓀴Banqueting House, and on the 1st of June, 1619, the first stone was
765𓀴laid, the architect having submitted a model to the King. The building
766𓀴was finished at the end of March, 1622, the expenditure having been
767𓀴14,940_l._ 4_s._ 1_d._ It is remarkable that the account was not
768𓀴finally settled until long after the death of King James, namely, in
769𓀴1633. It may be well here to give the technical account of the new
770𓀴building, probably written by Jones himself. It was described as 110
771𓀴feet in length, and 55 in width within. The wall of the foundation is
772𓀴14 feet in thickness. The first storey to the height of 16 feet was of
773𓀴Oxfordshire stone, rusticated on the outside and bricked on the inside.
774𓀴The Banqueting Hall was 55 feet in height to the roof, the walls
775𓀴being 5 feet thick, made of Northamptonshire stone, with two orders
776𓀴of columns and pilasters, the lower Ionic and the higher Composite,
777𓀴with their architrave, frieze, cornice, and other ornaments of the
778𓀴kind; also rails and “balustres” round about the top of the building,
779𓀴all of Portland stone, with fourteen windows on each side; one great
780𓀴window at the upper end, and five doors of stone with frontispieces and
781𓀴cartouches; the inside brought up with brick, finished over with two
782𓀴orders of columns and pilasters, part of stone and part of brick, with
783𓀴their architectural frieze and cornice, with a gallery upon the two
784𓀴sides, and the lower end borne upon great cartouches of timber carved,
785𓀴with rails and “balustres” of timber, and the floor laid with spruce
786𓀴deals; a strong timber roof covered with lead, and under it a ceiling
787𓀴divided into a fret made of great cornices enriched with carving; with
788𓀴painting, glazing, &c. The master-mason was the famous Nicholas Stone,
789𓀴who sculptured the water-gate at the foot of Buckingham Street, and
790𓀴to whom Cunningham attributes the monument of Sir Francis Vere in
791𓀴Westminster Abbey. If the beautiful wreaths and the capitals of the
792𓀴pilasters are still as he left them, they show exactly that kind of
793𓀴reticence which is one of the most charming characteristics of really
794𓀴high art. Inigo was too good an architect to leave anything like this
795𓀴to a workman in whom he could not thoroughly confide, but it is evident
796𓀴that what Gibbons did for Wren, Stone did for Jones.
797𓀴
798𓀴[Illustration: _Detail of Banqueting House_.

801𓀴
802𓀴It will have been perceived that the proportions of the interior were
803𓀴those which all but the modern anomalous architects have found to be
804𓀴the best. The room is formed of a double cube, the height being equal
805𓀴to the width, and the length double the height. A gallery was supported
806𓀴on engaged columns of the Ionic order. An upper order was of Corinthian
807𓀴pilasters. The roof was flat and divided into nine compartments, with
808𓀴very handsome mouldings between. The central compartment was oval, and
809𓀴contained Rubens’s principal picture of the “Apotheosis of James I.”
810𓀴This beautiful chamber was never designed for a chapel. We shall have
811𓀴occasion to describe further on what Jones designed for that purpose.
812𓀴It is reported that Rubens was assisted in these pictures by Jordaens.
813𓀴He received three thousand pounds for them, and they have been cleaned
814𓀴and restored several times at considerable expense. The figures are
815𓀴colossal, the children being more than nine feet high. The Banqueting
816𓀴House, though never consecrated, was made a Royal Chapel in 1724. Two
817𓀴years ago it was handed over to the United Service Institution, who
818𓀴have added to the south side a building which, in my opinion, forms
819𓀴a serious eyesore. It is curious that with all the wealth of design
820𓀴left by Inigo Jones, and ready to the hands of the Institution, they
821𓀴could not find something better than that by which they have disfigured
822𓀴every view of the Banqueting House. A great French architect named
823𓀴Azout, who visited England about 1685, is said to have declared that
824𓀴this “was the most finished of the modern buildings on this side the
825𓀴Alps.” To a sincere lover of beauty in architecture, this opinion
826𓀴will commend itself. It is sometimes said that the famous cartoons of
827𓀴Raphael were brought to England as designs for the tapestry for the
828𓀴Banqueting House. After the death of King Charles, they were sold,
829𓀴and were purchased by the Spanish Ambassador, Alonso de Cardanas. This
830𓀴is likely enough, as also that he sent them into Spain. Some hangings,
831𓀴said to be the same, but of this there could be no proof, were brought
832𓀴to London and exhibited at the Egyptian Hall, in Piccadilly, in 1825.
833𓀴They represented passages in the Acts of the Apostles. What became of
834𓀴them we do not know. I have only seen them mentioned in Tymms’s account
835𓀴of Whitehall in the second volume of Britton’s _Edifices_.
836𓀴
837𓀴[Illustration: _Section of the Banqueting House_.
838𓀴
839𓀴_From_ KENT’S “_Inigo Jones_.”]
840𓀴
841𓀴A curious question arises, which is not very easily answered: Where
842𓀴would this building have stood in the complete palace? The visitor
843𓀴entering the great court would have found three other buildings
844𓀴resembling this one. Two were to be at the northern end on either side,
845𓀴and two more at the southern end. Connecting them were two buildings
846𓀴of much greater beauty and of large size, the whole court being no
847𓀴less than 378 feet wide and 728 feet long. If, as Fergusson and others
848𓀴have asserted, the Banqueting House was at the north-eastern corner,
849𓀴it would be on the visitor’s left, while a chapel would have been on
850𓀴his right. At the centre of the façade on the right was the entrance
851𓀴to the royal apartments, which were thus arranged to be on the western
852𓀴side and to look out on the park, to the south of the Treasury. On the
853𓀴opposite side of the great court access was to be obtained to a noble
854𓀴hall, suitable for state occasions, and, in fact, the buildings on this
855𓀴side, which were to look on the river, were of a public character as
856𓀴distinguished from the private apartments of the King and the royal
857𓀴family. If, as seems probable, the Banqueting House stood at the
858𓀴north-east corner, and if we look at the plan of Whitehall which George
859𓀴Vertue engraved for the Society of Antiquaries, we find that Inigo’s
860𓀴building is nearly in the middle of the palace. If we measure 728 feet
861𓀴to the southward, it takes us all that distance towards Westminster,
862𓀴and overwhelms in building-stone the whole of the Privy Garden and
863𓀴part of the Bowling Green. All the great ranges of buildings to the
864𓀴northward—the kitchen court, the wood-yard, the small beer-buttery,
865𓀴and the two Scotland Yards—would have had to go. We can but conjecture
866𓀴that Inigo wished to have a grand open space before his Charing Cross
867𓀴façade—what the French call a “place d’armes.” On the Westminster
868𓀴side there could not have been much space beyond the Bowling Green.
869𓀴The park, of course, was open, and so was the river. Much thought
870𓀴accordingly was spent on these fronts, and perhaps that to the Thames
871𓀴shows Jones at his very best. No description can do it any kind of
872𓀴justice; but it may be worth while to mention the principal points. The
873𓀴centre was of three storeys, the lowest with rusticated pilasters. The
874𓀴next storey has features common to much of the design, but two flanking
875𓀴buildings only two storeys high are marked by a studied plainness, flat
876𓀴pilasters being between the windows. At either end of the front we
877𓀴find three-storey pavilions—we can hardly call them towers. They, like
878𓀴the centre, have engaged columns standing well out. The most beautiful
879𓀴thing on this front is a projecting portico in the centre, three arches
880𓀴wide and one deep. This beautiful balcony—the most elegant little bit
881𓀴in the whole design—is of the Corinthian order, two storeys high, the
882𓀴lower rusticated, and on a balustrade above are the statues with which
883𓀴Inigo always liked to relieve his sky-line.

890𓀴
891𓀴The Westminster side had an archway “for the street of Whitehall” and
892𓀴the right of way. It is open through the ground storey and an entresol,
893𓀴and is flanked by two massive towers of four storeys, crowned by small
894𓀴cupolas.
895𓀴
896𓀴The Charing Cross front being to the north was kept studiously plain.
897𓀴It was not until our own day that an architect put lavish decorations
898𓀴on that side of a building. Wren knew as well as Jones that mass,
899𓀴not ornament, is appropriate to this aspect, and we used to be able
900𓀴to admire his taste in the north transept of Westminster Abbey, now
901𓀴altered. The delicate proportions, the fine central archway, and the
902𓀴arcade at the western end of the façade, make up a very pleasing
903𓀴composition, and, viewed across a wide parade-ground, would have
904𓀴produced a marvellously picturesque effect.
905𓀴
906𓀴On the King’s side—that is, to the westward of the street—was to be a
907𓀴circular court, which most architectural critics have highly praised.
908𓀴It has always been known as the Persian Court. Caryatides, we may
909𓀴remark, are female figures, Persians male. It consisted of a kind of
910𓀴circular corridor, two storeys high. Kent gives several views with
911𓀴sections of this Persian Court. Instead of pillars or pilasters were
912𓀴Caryatides in the upper range, and Persians in the lower. Those in
913𓀴the lower range had Tuscan capitals above their heads; those in the
914𓀴upper had Composite or Corinthian capitals. Here Inigo departed from
915𓀴his usual rule, and covered the wall with the most elaborate ornament.
916𓀴The court looks very well in Müller’s bird’s-eye view, but not so well
917𓀴in Kent’s elevations and sections. The plan shows that the circular
918𓀴corridor would have formed a most convenient passage connecting the
919𓀴King’s and Queen’s private apartments with those of their attendants.
920𓀴Two wide square courts were to north and south.
921𓀴
922𓀴[Illustration: _First Design by_ INIGO JONES
923𓀴
924𓀴_for the Rebuilding of Whitehall. Waterside Front. From Müller._]
925𓀴
926𓀴The other wing, so called, of the palace had also three courts, the
927𓀴interior architecture of which we may judge of by looking at the back,
928𓀴or east, side of the Banqueting House, which was built to form part
929𓀴of the north-eastern court on one side, and to look on the street of
930𓀴Whitehall on the other. The Chapel was to have corresponded in the
931𓀴north-western corner. Jones left elaborate plans for this building, and
932𓀴a section in Kent is one of the most beautiful things in a beautiful
933𓀴book. It was a double cube, of course, but the roof was vaulted, or, at
934𓀴least, coved. Elaborate symbolical carving and angelic figures are on
935𓀴the wall. The chapel has a narrow gallery above, and the order, which
936𓀴is Ionic, fluted, below, is Corinthian above. Wide-arched openings
937𓀴are in the view in Kent, but he does not show us what the other, or
938𓀴chancel, end was to be like. It may be worth noting that, like Wren,
939𓀴Jones was very free in his use of the orders, and it is not always
940𓀴possible in the prints to distinguish Corinthian from Composite; but,
941𓀴of course, where the lower storey was Ionic, the upper would not be
942𓀴Composite.
943𓀴
944𓀴As to the merits of this design for a palace, critics have been very
945𓀴well agreed—except, unfortunately, during the madness of the supposed
946𓀴Gothic revival. Had Barry been desired to use, or adapt, Jones’s
947𓀴design, or part of it, for the new Houses of Parliament, what a noble
948𓀴river-front we might have had! But it is useless to pursue such
949𓀴thoughts. The opportunity was lost, and, for certainly the past thirty
950𓀴years, there have been very few people in England who were really able
951𓀴to judge of the Houses of Parliament apart from their ornamentation.
952𓀴Inigo Jones’s design would have been the better of any ornament that
953𓀴could have been bestowed on it, but ornament was not necessary. Marble
954𓀴columns and gilt capitals would have looked well, but plain stone would
955𓀴have been enough.
956𓀴
957𓀴[Illustration: _First Design by_ INIGO JONES
958𓀴

960𓀴
961𓀴Fergusson well remarks that the greatest error in Jones’s design for
962𓀴Whitehall was the vastness of its scale. It was as far beyond the
963𓀴means as beyond the wants of James I. It is not, he continues, in
964𓀴a long passage from which I only take a few sentences, so much in
965𓀴dimensions as in beauty of design that this proposal surpassed other
966𓀴European palaces. Externally, it would have surpassed the Louvre,
967𓀴Versailles, or any other building of the kind, “by the happy manner in
968𓀴which the angles are accentuated, by the boldness of the centre masses
969𓀴in each façade, and by the play of light and shade, and the variety
970𓀴of sky-line, which is obtained without ever interfering with the
971𓀴simplicity of the design or the harmony of the whole.”
972𓀴
973𓀴Sir William Chambers, the last of the Inigo Jones and Wren succession,
974𓀴speaks especially of the circular court described above. There are few
975𓀴nobler thoughts, he observes, in the remains of antiquity. The effect
976𓀴of the building, properly carried out, would have been surprising and
977𓀴great in the highest degree. The diameter of the court was to be 210
978𓀴feet, the ground floor being an open arcade or cloister.
979𓀴
980𓀴Jones wholly misapprehended the depth of the King’s purse when he made
981𓀴a design of so costly a character. Otherwise, we must conclude that he
982𓀴made these beautiful drawings for his own pleasure—a kind of vision
983𓀴which he knew could never be realised. That this is not a correct
984𓀴statement of the case seems to be proved by what followed. Let us take
985𓀴the Banqueting House as a unit. It cost, roughly speaking, 20,000_l._,
986𓀴of which sum 15,000_l._ was for the mere building. Three similar
987𓀴buildings in the same court would have cost at least 60,000_l._, the
988𓀴chapel more than the rest. This foots up at once to 80,000_l._ The
989𓀴Persian Court could not have cost less than 50,000_l._ Add to this
990𓀴the two magnificent halls, and we have 80,000_l._ more. Yet we have
991𓀴only accounted for two of the seven courts, and have said nothing of
992𓀴the four fronts. We feel tempted to think that Inigo, like the person
993𓀴mentioned by Tennyson, built his soul “a lordly pleasure-house, wherein
994𓀴at ease for aye to dwell,” and that he neither intended nor expected
995𓀴that King James should carry it out. That this is not the case we can
996𓀴judge by the design he made for Charles I. in 1639. It was to be of
997𓀴only half the dimensions, and was to be studiously plain. Whereas the
998𓀴Banqueting House was one of the plainest and least costly features of
999𓀴the 1619 design, it would appear in the new view as one of the most
1000𓀴elaborately ornamented. But he misjudged the purse of the son, as
1001𓀴he had misjudged that of the father. Not a stone was ever laid, and
1002𓀴when, a few years later, the war broke out, it was hopeless to think
1003𓀴that Charles, though sorely in need of a commodious and really royal
1004𓀴residence, could ever build, even after the new and modified design

1018𓀴
1019𓀴The chief points of this design may be briefly indicated here, as the
1020𓀴next chapter will be filled with matters of a very different character.
1021𓀴The western front was to be towards the street of Whitehall; that is
1022𓀴to say, the palace was to be less than half the size of that designed
1023𓀴for James I. No archways were needed across the road. In the middle
1024𓀴of this façade was a fine arch, opening between the Banqueting House
1025𓀴toward the north and the Chapel, the corresponding building toward the
1026𓀴south. The wall between was very simple, only containing three rows of
1027𓀴square-headed windows. What would have been a beautiful and picturesque
1028𓀴feature were the domed towers which formed the ends of the front, each
1029𓀴containing a triple Venetian window. The side to the river was to have
1030𓀴a kind of arcade or cloister; but the Persians and the Caryatides have
1031𓀴disappeared, with most of the reception-rooms and public halls. This
1032𓀴design was brought forward again after the fire in 1698; but William
1033𓀴III. was too busy with the Continental war, and probably also too poor
1034𓀴to do anything. It is worth more than a passing glance, and includes
1035𓀴some of Jones’s most matured work. Campbell obtained it in 1717 from
1036𓀴an “ingenious gentleman,” probably an architect, and possibly the
1037𓀴architect whom William proposed to employ in rebuilding the palace. It
1038𓀴will be found in the second volume of the _Vitruvius Britannicus_.

1051𓀴
1052𓀴James I. died in 1625, at Theobalds, having removed thither from
1053𓀴Whitehall shortly before. His son Charles I. succeeded him, and for
1054𓀴the first years of his reign lived in the old royal apartments on the
1055𓀴Thames’ bank. The omens observed at the time were all against the
1056𓀴new King. Had his reign been prosperous we should have heard nothing
1057𓀴about them. First of all, it was remarked that the breath was hardly
1058𓀴out of King James’s body when the Knight Marshal, in proclaiming his
1059𓀴successor at the gate of Theobalds, made a bad blunder. He said Charles
1060𓀴was the late King’s rightful and _dubitable_ heir. He meant to have
1061𓀴said “indubitable.” When the news came to Whitehall, Bishop Laud was
1062𓀴in the middle of his sermon, for it was a Sunday, and broke off in
1063𓀴order to let Charles be proclaimed, nor did he afterwards conclude, so
1064𓀴that the new King and the congregation went away without a blessing.
1065𓀴At the coronation, in February, 1626, it was similarly noticed that
1066𓀴no procession through the City from the Tower to Westminster could
1067𓀴take place, because the plague was raging. Several still more ominous
1068𓀴accidents marked the day. The wing broke off the golden dove which
1069𓀴formed part of the regalia. The Bishop of Carlisle, Richard Senhouse,
1070𓀴by an inexcusable blunder, took for the text of his coronation sermon,
1071𓀴“Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,”
1072𓀴from the Revelation. This was much remarked upon then and afterwards,
1073𓀴and it is very possible that Charles alluded to the sermon in the last
1074𓀴words he ever uttered. But another circumstance was most remarked
1075𓀴upon that dark February day in the gloom of the old Abbey. For some
1076𓀴unexplained reason, Charles was dressed, not in purple, like the kings
1077𓀴before him, but in white satin. Later on this gained for Charles the
1078𓀴name of “The White King,” and at his burial, in February, 1649, at
1079𓀴Windsor, in a snow-storm, as the flakes fell upon the coffin, there
1080𓀴were some present who remembered the omen of twenty-three years before.
1081𓀴Finally, as if to crown all, that day was marked in the memories of
1082𓀴many by a shock of earthquake.
1083𓀴
1084𓀴There is little at first to connect Charles with Whitehall, but towards
1085𓀴the end of the coronation year a curious scene took place there. The
1086𓀴King, weary of the young Bishop and his twenty-nine priests who had
1087𓀴come over with Henrietta Maria, decreed that they must return home.
1088𓀴This they were very unwilling to do. With them were also to go an
1089𓀴immense crew of attendants, whose vagaries disturbed both Whitehall and
1090𓀴St. James’s. They exceeded in numbers even the four hundred who had
1091𓀴formed the household of Henry, prince of Wales. Contemporary letters
1092𓀴are full of their arrogance and greed. With the French priests came
1093𓀴a crowd of English Jesuits and the like, whose position, as the law
1094𓀴stood then, was wholly illegal. The story that Henrietta Maria had to
1095𓀴do penance at the instance of her French confessor, by going barefoot
1096𓀴to Tyburn to glorify the memory of the Gunpowder Conspirators, rests
1097𓀴on very slight evidence. One thing is certain: if she went, it was at
1098𓀴the instance of one of the English priests. Even at the present day
1099𓀴few Frenchmen know anything of English history thirty years old. It
1100𓀴was, however, one thing to resolve, another actually to get rid of
1101𓀴these intruders. At first the King wrote to Buckingham, who was then
1102𓀴at Paris, to try to persuade the queen-mother of the necessity of the
1103𓀴step he contemplated, and, moreover, to ask her to “find a means to
1104𓀴make themselves suitors to be gone.” Whether she complied or not, the
1105𓀴Queen’s servants were far too well off to think of moving. Marshal
1106𓀴Bassompierre came over in order to arrange matters, but without avail.
1107𓀴His report of a stormy interview with Charles is a mass of bombast.
1108𓀴The King, coming to Whitehall, and entering the Queen’s apartments
1109𓀴to inform her that he must be obeyed—that he had put the matter
1110𓀴into the hands of that stern soldier, Lord Conway, who had arranged
1111𓀴everything—found “a number of her domestics irreverently dancing and
1112𓀴curvetting in her presence.” He took her by the hand, led her into an
1113𓀴adjoining chamber, and locked himself in with her.
1114𓀴
1115𓀴[Illustration: _The Guardroom, Scotland Yard_.
1116𓀴
1117𓀴_From an Etching by_ J. T. SMITH, 1805.]
1118𓀴
1119𓀴Meanwhile, Conway took the French Bishop and his priests into St.
1120𓀴James’s Park, and informed them briefly of the King’s unquestionable
1121𓀴causes of complaint, and of the arrangements made for their immediate
1122𓀴departure. The Bishop refused to move, saying he regarded himself as an
1123𓀴ambassador. Conway replied that he might regard himself as he pleased,
1124𓀴but that if he did not depart peacefully he would be turned out by
1125𓀴force.
1126𓀴
1127𓀴Next, Lord Conway entered Whitehall, where he firmly but politely
1128𓀴informed the French servants of the Queen of his errand. They were to
1129𓀴go first to Somerset House in the Strand, where he proposed to make
1130𓀴separate arrangements for each of them. The women screamed and stormed,
1131𓀴and after Conway had given them reasonable time, he summoned the yeomen
1132𓀴of the guard, who thrust them out forcibly and locked the doors after
1133𓀴them. They went to Somerset House, where Charles himself visited them
1134𓀴the same afternoon.
1135𓀴
1136𓀴More than a month later they were still at Somerset House, when Lord
1137𓀴Conway was again called in; but, what with the obstinacy of the Bishop,
1138𓀴and the clamour of the women, it took four days and forty carriages to
1139𓀴transport them to Dover. The whole story is in Ellis’s _Letters_, and
1140𓀴in _D’Israeli’s Curiosities of Literature_, and is well summarised by
1141𓀴Jesse in his _Court of England under the Stuarts_, to which I may refer
1142𓀴a reader interested in the subject; my own concern having, of course,
1143𓀴been only with that part which related to Whitehall.
1144𓀴
1145𓀴That Charles should have been forced into war, and, above all, a civil
1146𓀴war, was a great misfortune to the progress of civilisation, as shown
1147𓀴in the arts and sciences. Painting, music, architecture flourished
1148𓀴at his Court, together with poetry and science. He probably brought
1149𓀴more fine pictures into England than all the kings put together since
1150𓀴his time. Walpole says, “As there was no art which Charles did not
1151𓀴countenance, the chasers and embossers of plate were among the number
1152𓀴of the protected at Court.” Casting in bronze was a favourite art,
1153𓀴and Fanelli, who made the statues of Charles and his Queen at St.
1154𓀴John’s College, Oxford, should be named, as well as Le Sœur, who made
1155𓀴the King’s equestrian statue which is now at Charing Cross, but which
1156𓀴was originally made for Lord Portland and set up at Roehampton. The
1157𓀴King’s cabinet pictures were lodged at Whitehall in a chamber expressly
1158𓀴built for them by Inigo Jones. Undoubtedly the pictures were, of all
1159𓀴his works of art, those which Charles chiefly loved. He contrived to
1160𓀴acquire a magnificent collection, and it is evident from one or two
1161𓀴entries that Jones had a general commission not to let anything slip
1162𓀴which would prove a desirable addition to the royal gallery. Although
1163𓀴his taste lay chiefly in ancient pictures, Charles largely patronised
1164𓀴Van Dyck, and Van Dyck’s principal pupils and contemporaries, such
1165𓀴as Janssen, Walker, and Dobson. Moreover, he bought on occasion
1166𓀴lavishly. The collection of the Duke of Mantua came into the market,
1167𓀴and was bought whole by the agents of King Charles. He hung it on the
1168𓀴walls of the Banqueting House, but intended to have embellished that
1169𓀴building with paintings by Van Dyck, representing ceremonials of the
1170𓀴Order of the Garter. These would naturally have comprised portraits
1171𓀴of most of the great men of the day. There was also a scheme on foot
1172𓀴for establishing a school of art somewhat on the lines of our Royal
1173𓀴Academy, but more distinctly intended for teaching. This, of course,
1174𓀴fell through, like all other schemes of the kind, during the civil war.
1175𓀴Before his death the leaders of the Commonwealth endeavoured to sell
1176𓀴off or otherwise make away with the treasures of art which Charles had
1177𓀴gathered. Their animosity against pictures containing representations
1178𓀴of the second person of the Holy Trinity or of the Virgin Mary induced
1179𓀴them to order their destruction. That very few of these orders were
1180𓀴carried out is plain from the list preserved by Walpole. We are
1181𓀴anticipating the order of events if we pause here to describe the
1182𓀴gradual dispersal of the great royal collection. The sale went on at
1183𓀴intervals from 1648 to 1653, but many pieces remained in England. Some
1184𓀴did not even leave Whitehall, and there are now many in the National
1185𓀴Gallery which once belonged to the unfortunate Charles.
1186𓀴
1187𓀴The best account of the sale is that written by Horace Walpole, who
1188𓀴used for his purpose the notes of George Vertue, the engraver. The
1189𓀴prices were fixed, but the highest bidder, if more was offered, was
1190𓀴adjudged the buyer. We cannot do better than take some items from
1191𓀴Walpole’s list. The cartoons of Raphael were bought in by Cromwell for
1192𓀴the insignificant sum of 300_l._ The other cartoons, those representing
1193𓀴the triumphs of Cæsar, by Andrea Mantegna, went for 1000_l._, and were
1194𓀴also reserved for Cromwell. They had formed part of the Mantua Gallery
1195𓀴already referred to. Apparently they had been removed from Whitehall to
1196𓀴Hampton Court, where they have ever since remained. We read of many
1197𓀴Madonnas; one, said to be by Raphael, fetching 800_l._; but another
1198𓀴Raphael, afterwards estimated much more highly, was the celebrated
1199𓀴“St. George and the Dragon,” sometimes called “St. Michael,” now in
1200𓀴the Louvre. A Venus, called “Del Pardo,” by Titian, sold for 600_l._
1201𓀴The “Mercury teaching Cupid, with Venus standing by,” painted by
1202𓀴Correggio, which is now in the National Gallery, went for 800_l._ This
1203𓀴had also formed an item in the great Mantua Collection. The picture had
1204𓀴many adventures. The Duke of Alva took it to Spain and subsequently
1205𓀴it became the property of the famous Prince of the Peace, in whose
1206𓀴collection it remained until 1808, when it fell into the hands of
1207𓀴Murat. It thus found its way back into Italy. Lord Castlereagh bought
1208𓀴it and the “Ecce Homo,” which hangs near it, from the ex-Queen of
1209𓀴Naples at Vienna, and in 1834 it was purchased from Lord Londonderry
1210𓀴for the National Gallery. Rubens’ “Peace and War” was presented to
1211𓀴Charles by the painter in 1630. It now only fetched 100_l._, and went
1212𓀴to the Doria Gallery at Genoa, whence it was sold, brought back to
1213𓀴England, and presented to the National Gallery in 1828 by the first
1214𓀴Duke of Sutherland. After the Restoration, strong efforts were made to
1215𓀴gather the dispersed pictures again. The States of Holland bought the
1216𓀴whole collection of Gerard Reyntz and presented them to Charles II. on
1217𓀴his restoration. The Government went to law with Van Leemput, who had
1218𓀴bought a great portrait of King Charles I., by Van Dyck, for 150_l._
1219𓀴There were various negotiations, in which Van Leemput was offered a
1220𓀴fair compensation. As he refused, the law was put in force, and Van
1221𓀴Leemput got nothing. This must not be confused with the Marlborough
1222𓀴Van Dyck which is now in the National Gallery. It is plain, remarks
1223𓀴Walpole, from a catalogue made for James II., that a large number
1224𓀴of pictures remained at Whitehall unsold, and it is very possible
1225𓀴that Oliver Cromwell intervened, when he had the power, to prevent
1226𓀴their sale. We must always thank his taste for having rescued the two
1227𓀴great sets of Mantegna’s and Raphael’s cartoons. It will be observed
1228𓀴that though the store was by no means exhausted, the sales ceased in
1229𓀴1653, the year of his inauguration as Protector. In 1660 Cromwell’s
1230𓀴widow tried in vain to retain possession of some pictures and other
1231𓀴treasures.
1232𓀴
1233𓀴Before we go on to speak of the great tragedy which gave Whitehall
1234𓀴a world-wide celebrity, we may make a note from a passage quoted by
1235𓀴Mr. Law in his catalogue of the pictures at Hampton Court. One of
1236𓀴these pictures represents Charles I. and his Queen dining in public.
1237𓀴The picture is by Van Bassen, who also painted the King and Queen
1238𓀴of Bohemia similarly employed. Mr. Law’s account of the first-named
1239𓀴picture is very interesting, and relates mainly to life at Whitehall.
1240𓀴The King and Queen are being “served by gentlemen-in-waiting with
1241𓀴dishes, more of which are being brought in from the door opposite them
1242𓀴by attendants. In the right corner is a sideboard, and wine cooling
1243𓀴in brass bowls on the floor. Several dogs are running about. At the
1244𓀴end of the hall is a raised and recessed daïs, where spectators are
1245𓀴looking on through some columns. The decoration of the hall is in
1246𓀴the classic taste, and is very fine and elaborate. On the walls hang
1247𓀴several pictures.” Though this doubtless belonged to Charles I., it is
1248𓀴not found catalogued among his pictures; but in the catalogue of James
1249𓀴II. we find No. 937: “A large piece, where King Charles the First and
1250𓀴Queen, and the Prince are at dinner.” It is dated over the door, on the
1251𓀴right, 1637. It is engraved in Jesse’s _Memoirs of the Stuarts_, and is
1252𓀴chiefly valuable for the architecture and decoration, and as exhibiting
1253𓀴the manners of the time, and the prevalent custom in that age of
1254𓀴royalty dining in public. “There were daily at Charles I.’s Court,
1255𓀴86 tables, well furnished each meal; whereof the King’s table had 28
1256𓀴dishes; the Queen’s, 24; 4 other tables, 16 dishes each, and so on. In
1257𓀴all about 500 dishes each meal, with bread, beer, wine and all things
1258𓀴necessary. There was spent yearly in the King’s house, of gross meat,
1259𓀴1500 oxen; 7000 sheep, 1200 calves; 300 porkers, 400 young beefs, 6800
1260𓀴lambs, 300 flitches of bacon; and 26 boars. Also 140 dozen geese, 250
1261𓀴dozen of capons, 470 dozen of hens, 750 dozen of pullets, 1470 dozen of
1262𓀴chickens; for bread, 364,000 bushels of wheat; and for drink, 600 tuns
1263𓀴of wine and 1700 tuns of beer; together with fish and fowl, fruit and
1264𓀴spice, proportionately.” (_Present State of London_, 1681.)
1265𓀴
1266𓀴As to Henrietta Maria at dinner, an anecdote is reported by Jesse:
1267𓀴“Notwithstanding her conciliating manners on her first arrival in
1268𓀴England, it soon became evident that the spirit of Henry IV. was not
1269𓀴entirely dormant in the bosom of his daughter. A singular scene, which
1270𓀴took place at Court, shortly after her marriage, is thus described by
1271𓀴an eye-witness. ‘The Queen, howsoever very little of stature, is yet
1272𓀴of a pleasing countenance, if she be pleased, but full of spirit and
1273𓀴vigour, and seems of a more than ordinary resolution. With one frown,
1274𓀴diverse of us being at Whitehall to see her, being at dinner, and the
1275𓀴room somewhat over-heated with the fire and company, she drove us all
1276𓀴out of the chamber. I suppose none but a Queen could have cast such a
1277𓀴scowl.’” (See Jesse’s _Court of England under the Stuarts_, ii. 16.)
1278𓀴
1279𓀴The whole sad history of the Great Rebellion has been told at full
1280𓀴length in divers places, and only incidentally concerns us here. We
1281𓀴see that Charles was shifty and wanting in straightforwardness. None
1282𓀴of his political opponents could trust even his promises. No one could
1283𓀴deny him both courage and coolness in the hour of danger. We might
1284𓀴dwell on what might have happened if he had saved Strafford; but the
1285𓀴bold policy in which that would have landed him—the policy Strafford
1286𓀴himself described as “thorough”—though it might have rid him of his
1287𓀴enemies, would have cost a tremendous price to the nation. When Charles
1288𓀴promised Strafford to save his life, he had scarcely power to make his
1289𓀴promise true. He gained nothing by Strafford’s death, and only lost one
1290𓀴of the two or three really able advisers he had. It is not possible to
1291𓀴believe that he thought the savage fanatics who clamoured for the great
1292𓀴minister’s blood would pause and ask no more. “Moderation” was a word
1293𓀴that did not exist in their vocabulary, and it is rather melancholy to
1294𓀴see John Milton made the mouthpiece of a series of foul scandals on a
1295𓀴King whose private life seems to have been absolutely pure, as Milton
1296𓀴must have known. But politics were up to boiling point in those days.
1297𓀴It was not enough to defeat an opponent in the House or at the poll;
1298𓀴he must be put to death. So far the traditions of the Tudor times
1299𓀴survived. Having stimulated their appetite by the death of Strafford,
1300𓀴under legal forms and with the unwilling consent of the King, they
1301𓀴proceeded to murder, by the travesty of a judicial process, the
1302𓀴highest they could find in the country. Archbishop Laud was brought
1303𓀴to trial, or rather to condemnation, in March, 1644, and in January,
1304𓀴1645, he was beheaded. There was only left to quench their thirst for
1305𓀴the best blood in the land a few nobles—the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl
1306𓀴of Holland, and others; but there was one victim, the highest of all,
1307𓀴and they had no notion of sparing him, though, by compassing his death,
1308𓀴they ruined their own cause.
1309𓀴
1310𓀴[Illustration: _Lambeth and Whitehall_.

1313𓀴
1314𓀴We can easily see that a Prime Minister like Strafford had done many
1315𓀴things to make himself hated. We can see that Laud was also hated,
1316𓀴mainly for being an archbishop. Another minister or another archbishop
1317𓀴would be appointed in course of time, and both would be hated, and
1318𓀴that, too, by a great many people who were, on the whole, loyal to
1319𓀴the Crown, if not to the person of Charles. The death of Charles at
1320𓀴Whitehall changed the feelings of this whole class. They may have
1321𓀴groaned, as we hear they did. Some groaned because their King was
1322𓀴killed, even though they may have thought he deserved his fate; but
1323𓀴the great majority saw that all the good the popular party might have
1324𓀴carried out for the people was annihilated at that one blow. Murderers
1325𓀴are seldom moderate and beneficent reformers, though Agathocles did
1326𓀴contrive to succeed in both these _rôles_ in Sicily. But that was a
1327𓀴long time ago and a long way off, and few of the truer patriots of
1328𓀴1649 looked at these violent proceedings without both apprehension and
1329𓀴horror—apprehension lest a murder of such huge dimensions should only
1330𓀴mean anarchy in the Government and oppression of the people—as, in
1331𓀴effect, it did—and horror at the perpetration of such an irrevocable
1332𓀴crime without any reference to the people, either at the hustings or by
1333𓀴a direct vote. But it appeared as if the Parliament, though, with the
1334𓀴help of the army, it could kill the King, could not dissolve itself.
1335𓀴The soldiers, however, without the Parliament, could, and did, force
1336𓀴a dissolution, and in our next chapter we shall see the chief leader
1337𓀴of the rebels residing in the old palace of Whitehall as a sovereign
1338𓀴prince.
1339𓀴
1340𓀴The greatest of all these changes was simply this. If we allow, as many
1341𓀴of the so-called Puritans did, that the King had strictly forfeited his
1342𓀴life, imprisonment, like that inflicted on Henry VI. for many years, or
1343𓀴exile, like that which James II. afterwards underwent, would have been
1344𓀴a sufficient penalty. France would not have gone to war to reinstate
1345𓀴a Protestant dynasty, as it did not half a century later go to war
1346𓀴to reinstate a Romanist, and the longer Charles I. lived the more
1347𓀴improbable the return of his son became. But that scaffold at Whitehall
1348𓀴altered the state of affairs. Instead of a King who certainly had not
1349𓀴deserved well of his people, it gave them a young and, so far as they
1350𓀴knew, an innocent and blameless King, whose coming they were forced, by
1351𓀴the violence of the dominant faction, to hope for as for the salvation
1352𓀴of their country.
1353𓀴
1354𓀴Very little of the history of the Great Rebellion concerns Whitehall,
1355𓀴at least until Oliver Cromwell assumes possession, and apes royalty
1356𓀴in the old halls; but in Rymer’s _Fœdera_ we may observe that, from
1357𓀴the beginning of the reign of James I., “Whitehall” gradually and
1358𓀴more and more becomes the official designation of the palace. Charles
1359𓀴naturally was not there during a long term of years. He was marching
1360𓀴and counter-marching in the north, and so mismanaging all his affairs
1361𓀴successively that, regarded as a game, the Civil War consisted of a
1362𓀴series of alternate military and diplomatic defeats. The inevitable
1363𓀴consequence was the utter ruin of the royal cause. In January, 1649
1364𓀴(then reckoned 1648), the King, a prisoner, was brought from Windsor
1365𓀴Castle and lodged at St. James’s. On Saturday, the 20th, he walked,
1366𓀴strongly guarded, across the park to Whitehall. He probably entered his
1367𓀴old palace by the stairs near the tilt-yard, and traversed the passage
1368𓀴which led to his former apartments. Here was a “bridge,” or floating
1369𓀴pier on the water’s edge, and he was put into a boat and rowed up to
1370𓀴Westminster, where he was placed in Sir Robert Cotton’s house. The King
1371𓀴was then brought into Westminster Hall and allowed a seat. Bradshaw was
1372𓀴president of the Court, and there were some eighty commissioners. The
1373𓀴King attended the Court four times in all, sometimes going in a Sedan
1374𓀴chair, sometimes, as we have seen, by boat. We need not detail the
1375𓀴proceedings of Bradshaw and his assessors; but there is one thing which
1376𓀴must be noted, namely, the dignity and tact of the King’s behaviour
1377𓀴when brought up to receive sentence. Green, who had but little sympathy
1378𓀴with him, observes, quoting Marvel, “Whatever had been the faults and
1379𓀴follies of his life—
1380𓀴
1381𓀴    “‘He nothing common did nor mean
1382𓀴    Upon that memorable scene.’”

1384𓀴[Illustration: _Whitehall, from the River_.
1385𓀴
1386𓀴_From_ OGILVY’S _Map_, 1677.]
1387𓀴
1388𓀴This fact—for it is not merely an opinion—seems to answer a question
1389𓀴that is often asked: Did the coolness of Charles on that last day
1390𓀴at Westminster Hall, and again on the scaffold at Whitehall, betray
1391𓀴any feeling, any certainty that he would be respited or rescued? A
1392𓀴moment’s thought dispels the idea. Charles was manly, dignified,
1393𓀴truthful before Bradshaw and before the crowds which had assembled
1394𓀴to see him die, because he recognised that all the finessing, the
1395𓀴double meanings, the secret understandings, and the thousand miserable
1396𓀴subterfuges which he imagined to be “statesmanship,” and with which
1397𓀴he had endeavoured to impose on the Scots and on the authorities of
1398𓀴Carisbrooke and of Hampton Court, had done nothing for him, and if
1399𓀴renewed now would have ensured that the fate which he foresaw had
1400𓀴at last overtaken him would be justified by a large section of his
1401𓀴contemporaries. He rose to the occasion. During those few hours at St.
1402𓀴James’s he saw that all he could do would be to save the throne for his
1403𓀴son, and he succeeded, but it was by a line of conduct wholly different
1404𓀴from that by which he had lost it for himself.
1405𓀴
1406𓀴The place of execution was most carefully chosen. Though called “the
1407𓀴open street of Whitehall,” it was far from being really open. On
1408𓀴the south were buildings pierced by the narrow archway of Holbein’s
1409𓀴Gate. On the west were the walled tilt-yard and the barracks and
1410𓀴other buildings, ending with Wallingford House. On the north was the
1411𓀴comparatively open roadway to Charing Cross. On the eastern side were
1412𓀴long rows of gabled buildings already described, with, just south of
1413𓀴an archway into the old courts of the palace, the Banqueting House.
1414𓀴It was sworn at the trials of the Regicides, a few years later, that
1415𓀴Oliver Cromwell superintended the arrangements. The evidence is not
1416𓀴well supported, but, owing to Cromwell’s great military reputation and
1417𓀴to his subsequent elevation to the Protectorate, everything at this
1418𓀴conjuncture was attributed to him. It is not very easy to reconcile
1419𓀴the conflicting details of different stories. It neither adds to nor
1420𓀴detracts from Oliver’s guilt, neither adds to nor detracts from his
1421𓀴fame, whether he was at Westminster or at Whitehall on that fatal day.
1422𓀴
1423𓀴The crowd coming into the narrow court from Charing Cross saw an empty
1424𓀴space in front of the hall. The palace and the barracks, and the
1425𓀴innumerable passages and lodgings, were lined with “the sour-visaged
1426𓀴saints” of the various Roundhead regiments—men to whom the death of
1427𓀴Charles would be a latter-day miracle, a sign from Heaven that their
1428𓀴cause was won—that the Millennium, the Fifth Monarchy, was about to
1429𓀴begin. Even when their own turn came such men believed, till they were
1430𓀴actually “dancing on air,” that they would be supernaturally rescued.
1431𓀴The crowd which swarmed into the street saw only a few soldiers round
1432𓀴the black scaffold which, at the height of the first floor, stood
1433𓀴in front of the hall, a little to the northward. The better sort of
1434𓀴spectators were on the roof of Wallingford House, not directly fronting
1435𓀴the scaffold, but near enough to see. Here was stationed the venerable
1436𓀴Archbishop Ussher of Armagh, who is reported to have fainted as he saw
1437𓀴the King led forth. Below was a man whose account of the scene would
1438𓀴have been invaluable now. He only alludes to it in a note written in
1439𓀴October, 1660, This was Samuel Pepys; and he remarks, after witnessing
1440𓀴the death of General Harrison, “thus it was my chance to see the King
1441𓀴beheaded at White Hall, and to see the first blood shed in revenge for
1442𓀴the blood of the King at Charing Cross.”
1443𓀴
1444𓀴The Banqueting House is clearly described for us in a note, probably
1445𓀴by Inigo Jones, which was printed a few pages back. It answers most of
1446𓀴the questions raised in a long correspondence in the papers a few years
1447𓀴ago. The situation, the problem to be solved, was briefly this. The
1448𓀴scaffold was before the two windows next to Charing Cross. A hole was
1449𓀴broken through the wall to admit of a passage to the platform direct
1450𓀴from the interior. The regicides saw that there would be great danger
1451𓀴in taking the King out by the only door, which was at the back or
1452𓀴east side of the hall. They would have had to conduct him by a narrow
1453𓀴open-air passage northward to the palace gate. After passing through
1454𓀴the gate he would have had to go several yards through the crowd before
1455𓀴he could reach the scaffold, wherever it was placed.
1456𓀴
1457𓀴But many asked, in the correspondence just mentioned, Why did they
1458𓀴break through the wall? Why did they not go through the window? Simply
1459𓀴because there was at that time no glazed window on the western front of
1460𓀴the hall. A great window was at the “upper end,” probably that toward
1461𓀴Westminster. There was, also, it is probable, a central window looking
1462𓀴into the palace court on the eastern side. But toward “the street of
1463𓀴Whitehall” there were no open windows, all being built up—as, indeed,
1464𓀴the lowest tier remained until a couple of years ago. It is unlikely,
1465𓀴though some have asserted it, that the upper tier had been opened and
1466𓀴glazed at this time. In any case, these upper windows, if they existed,
1467𓀴which is unlikely, would have been of no use to the contrivers of the
1468𓀴King’s death. They were too high up and inaccessible except through a
1469𓀴narrow balcony within the hall, where one man might have successfully
1470𓀴resisted hundreds. The window “at the upper end” may have given light
1471𓀴enough, as the hall was not built for use in daylight. It remained in
1472𓀴this twilight condition until George I. opened it as a chapel about
1473𓀴1724. Then windows on the first floor became necessary. At first, as on
1474𓀴the eastern side, only the centre window was opened. As late as 1761,
1475𓀴the third and fifth were still built up. It was probably not until
1476𓀴1830, when the hall was “thoroughly restored” by Sir John Soane, that
1477𓀴all the windows on the western side were opened, except those on the
1478𓀴ground floor. The ground floor windows were opened first for the United
1479𓀴Service Institution. It was asserted in the daily papers that they were
1480𓀴re-opened, but, as a fact, they never were opened before.
1481𓀴
1482𓀴If we schedule these notes we may safely conclude that the lowest tier
1483𓀴of windows was only glazed in our own day; that those of the middle—the
1484𓀴Ionic storey—were still unglazed in 1649; and that in Silvestre’s view,
1485𓀴taken about fifty years after the great tragedy, there was not a single
1486𓀴glazed window on this, the western, front. All the apparent openings
1487𓀴were filled with masonry.
1488𓀴
1489𓀴We now understand why the wall had to be broken through, and perhaps
1490𓀴why the middle window was chosen. The scaffold stretched from the
1491𓀴opening to the north-west corner of the hall, both it and the short
1492𓀴passage leading to it being parallel with, and possibly close against,
1493𓀴the face of the blank wall with its closed and built-up windows.
1494𓀴The reason for this arrangement is obvious. Had the passage and the
1495𓀴scaffold jutted out at right angles they would have reached far into
1496𓀴the surging and probably angry crowd, and the number and daring of the
1497𓀴soldiers must have been quadrupled at least. Again, had the scaffold
1498𓀴stretched toward the southern extremity of the Banqueting House, it
1499𓀴would have been close to the gallery by which Charles had entered
1500𓀴the palace that morning. This gallery, in fact, touched the southern
1501𓀴corner of the hall. The military eye of the officer who made and
1502𓀴carried out the arrangements must have seen dangers of rescue and other
1503𓀴possibilities which it was needful to guard against. Knowing all these
1504𓀴things and others of the kind, we see that some of the contemporary
1505𓀴views—they are chiefly Dutch—which show the northward position of
1506𓀴the scaffold are correct, and not those—chiefly English—which adorn
1507𓀴prayer-books printed after the Restoration, and place the scaffold
1508𓀴before the middle window.
1509𓀴
1510𓀴When Charles was brought out, he showed that, as he himself had said
1511𓀴to Lord Digby, if he could not live like a King, he could die like a
1512𓀴gentleman. Juxon, at that time Bishop of London, had the courage to
1513𓀴attend him, as well as Herbert, his long-tried servant. The King’s last
1514𓀴devotions in his old chapel were interrupted by the impertinences of
1515𓀴some of the unauthorised ministers, whose nonconformist consciences
1516𓀴probably justified their interference. There was some unexpected delay
1517𓀴in the preparations. If the carpenters employed were not Roundheads or
1518𓀴Fifth Monarchy fanatics, it is easy to understand that they hesitated
1519𓀴over a task which would make them marked men among their fellows for
1520𓀴years to come.
1521𓀴
1522𓀴[Illustration: _The Execution of Charles I. From a Print of_ 1649.]
1523𓀴
1524𓀴The King had reached Whitehall at ten. It was now past noon, the
1525𓀴dinner-hour of that day. Some dishes were provided for his use, but
1526𓀴he would not eat. He had received the Holy Communion, and would eat
1527𓀴no more in this world. Meanwhile, he retired to the apartments he had
1528𓀴occupied in happier days, and gave himself up to private meditation and
1529𓀴prayer. As the afternoon wore on, Bishop Juxon persuaded him, lest his
1530𓀴strength should fail him at the last, to eat a piece of bread and drink
1531𓀴a glass of wine. Then he went with the soldiers to where in the western
1532𓀴wall of the Banqueting House the masonry had been pierced to give
1533𓀴access to the scaffold. Jesse, writing just after Soane’s operations in
1534𓀴1830, reports that he had seen traces of the opening in the brickwork.
1535𓀴He does not say clearly where it was, nor does it now greatly matter,
1536𓀴as we know where it must have been. Charles very soon reached the
1537𓀴scaffold and made ready for the end. Meanwhile, Juxon spoke to him of
1538𓀴the future life. It was far off, he said, but the passage short. The
1539𓀴King replied as if grateful for the good Bishop’s dry and dull remarks.
1540𓀴If we contrast them with the “Son of Saint Louis, ascend to Heaven!” of
1541𓀴another ecclesiastic, they seem all the more tame. But to the King’s
1542𓀴ear they brought a different echo. He remembered that he had once been
1543𓀴crowned. The applauding congregation had crowded round him in the old
1544𓀴Abbey close by; and the words of Bishop Senhouse, so distasteful then,
1545𓀴so truly prophetic now, came into his mind: “Be thou faithful unto
1546𓀴death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” He turned to Juxon and
1547𓀴answered, “I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown.” The
1548𓀴Bishop, who was not at the coronation, probably wondered. Then followed
1549𓀴the gift of his jewel of St. George, with the still unexplained charge:
1550𓀴“Remember!” The block was low, it seemed too low. But after a moment’s
1551𓀴hesitation—to quote the words of Marvell once more—
1552𓀴
1553𓀴    “He laid his comely head
1554𓀴    Down as upon a bed;”
1555𓀴
1556𓀴and in a few moments more the White King had set out on his last
1557𓀴journey, “faithful unto death.”

1571𓀴
1572𓀴
1573𓀴It is very probable that, among the colonels and generals who lodged
1574𓀴themselves, or were lodged, in Whitehall after the death of Charles
1575𓀴I., Oliver Cromwell was one. Five years elapsed before he came into
1576𓀴residence as Lord Protector, but, whether as a military commander or as
1577𓀴a minister of state, there were several capacities in which he could
1578𓀴have claimed chambers in the great straggling congeries of separate
1579𓀴sets of apartments which were comprised in the palace. The amount of
1580𓀴his guilt in the King’s murder it is difficult to assess. He may have
1581𓀴been no more involved than any other member of the Regicide party,
1582𓀴except, of course, Bradshaw. Cromwell’s subsequent prominence made him
1583𓀴the subject of every rumour, every fable. When any one heard a story
1584𓀴against a member of Parliament or an officer of the Roundheads, if no
1585𓀴name was put to it, that of Cromwell was ready to hand. Jesse reports
1586𓀴one which is more than usually improbable:—
1587𓀴
1588𓀴After the decapitation of Charles, he is said to have paid a visit to
1589𓀴the corpse, and, putting his finger to the neck, to have made some
1590𓀴remarks on the soundness of the body and the promise which it presented
1591𓀴of longevity. According to another account, on entering the chamber,
1592𓀴he found the coffin closed, and, being unable to raise the lid with
1593𓀴his staff, he took the sword of one Bowtell, a private soldier, who
1594𓀴was standing by, and opened it with the hilt. Bowtell, asking him what
1595𓀴government they should have now, he said the same that then was.
1596𓀴
1597𓀴How an officer, even though he may have been on duty, could penetrate
1598𓀴to the chamber of death in such a way must remain a mystery. The body
1599𓀴of Charles was conveyed from the scaffold by the faithful Herbert, with
1600𓀴Juxon’s assistance. It was placed in one of the King’s apartments,
1601𓀴that nearest, we learn, to the back-stairs. Topham, private surgeon
1602𓀴to Fairfax, was employed to sew on the head and to embalm the body.
1603𓀴Permission was asked to bury it in the chapel of Henry VII., but this
1604𓀴the republican authorities refused, though they provided five hundred
1605𓀴pounds for the funeral expenses. A coffin covered with black velvet
1606𓀴had been ready on the scaffold. In this the body was removed to St.
1607𓀴James’s Palace, and placed in a leaden coffin. There it remained
1608𓀴more than a week, and was seen by many visitors. The execution had
1609𓀴taken place on Tuesday, the 30th of January. On Wednesday, the 7th
1610𓀴of February, a little procession was formed, consisting, besides the
1611𓀴hearse, of four mourning coaches, in which were Bishop Juxon, the Duke
1612𓀴of Richmond, Lords Hertford, Southampton and Lindsay, with Mildmay and
1613𓀴Herbert. At Windsor the first halt was at the Deanery, but the coffin
1614𓀴was afterwards removed to the King’s apartments in the Upper Ward.
1615𓀴Meanwhile a search was made in St. George’s Chapel for a suitable
1616𓀴vault, and, that which contained the remains of Henry VIII. and Jane
1617𓀴Seymour having been discovered, the body of King Charles was carried
1618𓀴by the Roundhead soldiers to the chapel, the snow falling thick on the
1619𓀴coffin of the White King.
1620𓀴
1621𓀴Many believed that his burial really took place within the precincts of
1622𓀴Whitehall, but an examination of the grave of Henry VIII. in the reign
1623𓀴of George III. revealed the decapitated corpse of Charles I., which,
1624𓀴after a careful examination by Sir Henry Halford, was restored once
1625𓀴more to its resting-place.
1626𓀴
1627𓀴Oliver Cromwell appears to have had lodgings within the precincts of
1628𓀴the palace, but at a great distance from the state apartments. A kind
1629𓀴of village clustered round the Tennis Court, a little to the southward
1630𓀴of the tilt-yard and the Horse Guards. A green lawn, and perhaps a
1631𓀴garden, existed here, and here General Monk subsequently had his
1632𓀴lodgings. A narrow passage or lane, known as the “Entrance to the
1633𓀴Cockpit,” led to them. It is as nearly as possible the modern Downing
1634𓀴Street.
1635𓀴
1636𓀴It was almost five years after the King’s death before Cromwell was
1637𓀴formally installed Protector. This was in December, 1653, a few days
1638𓀴only before the end of the year, as we should reckon it, because
1639𓀴in those days 1653 went on till the 25th of March, 1654. About one
1640𓀴o’clock “his Highness” left the Cockpit in a coach of state. Before
1641𓀴him went the judges, the members of the Council, the Lord Mayor, and
1642𓀴the aldermen. The procession passed through King Street to Westminster
1643𓀴Hall. There he accepted the articles which had been prepared, and
1644𓀴the procession returned. In the Banqueting House a minister made an
1645𓀴exhortation to the new Lord Protector, the Lord Mayor sitting by, and
1646𓀴so the proceedings concluded.
1647𓀴
1648𓀴Cromwell apparently returned for the time being to his lodgings in
1649𓀴the Cockpit, and the state apartments were got ready for him. He went
1650𓀴over to the Banqueting House to receive foreign ambassadors, which he
1651𓀴did seated on something very like a royal throne. The whole palace was
1652𓀴granted to him, and, as we have seen, it was at about this date when
1653𓀴the sale of the royal collection of pictures ceased.
1654𓀴
1655𓀴As the spring drew on he thought it was time to move. Jesse supplies us
1656𓀴with the following notes on this event. The contemporary notices of the
1657𓀴removal of the Protector to the stately apartments of Whitehall are not
1658𓀴without interest:—
1659𓀴
1660𓀴“April 13, 1654. This day the bed-chamber, and the rest of the lodgings
1661𓀴and rooms appointed for the Lord Protector in Whitehall, were prepared
1662𓀴for his Highness to remove from the Cockpit on the morrow.”—“His
1663𓀴Highness the Lord Protector, with his lady and family, this day (April
1664𓀴14) dined at Whitehall, whither his Highness and family are removed,
1665𓀴and did this night lie there, and do there continue.”—“April 15. His
1666𓀴Highness went this day to Hampton Court, and returned again at night.”
1667𓀴
1668𓀴Hampton Court and Windsor Castle had been granted to him as well as
1669𓀴Whitehall. Poor Mrs. Cromwell, who seems to have been of a simple
1670𓀴and unostentatious character, can hardly have relished the change.
1671𓀴She became “Her Highness the Protectress,” and had more servants and
1672𓀴attendants than she can have known what to do with. The exact part of
1673𓀴the palace in which the new state apartments were placed is unknown. It
1674𓀴was probably not where the late King lived, nor, on the other hand, can
1675𓀴it have been far from the Banqueting House and the picture gallery. In
1676𓀴addition to the Lord Protector and the Lady Protectress, room had to
1677𓀴be found for their august family and for sons-in-law and children. It
1678𓀴is not uninteresting to read this contemporary notice from the _Weekly
1679𓀴Intelligencer_:—
1680𓀴
1681𓀴“The Privy Lodgings for his Highness the Lord Protector in Whitehall
1682𓀴are now in readiness, as also the lodgings for his Lady Protectress;
1683𓀴and likewise the privy kitchen, and other kitchens, butteries and
1684𓀴offices; and it is conceived the whole family will be settled there
1685𓀴before Easter. The tables for diet prepared are these:—
1686𓀴
1687𓀴    “A table for his Highness.
1688𓀴    “A table for the Protectress.
1689𓀴    “A table for Chaplains and Strangers.
1690𓀴    “A table for the Steward and Gentlemen.
1691𓀴    “A table for the Gentleman.
1692𓀴    “A table for coachmen, grooms, and other domestic servants.
1693𓀴    “A table for Inferiors, or sub-servants.”
1694𓀴
1695𓀴Nothing can be more curious than to observe the change which seems
1696𓀴to have come over the plain Huntingdonshire squire. He arrogated to
1697𓀴himself and received all the deference previously paid to a sovereign.
1698𓀴He allowed nothing to be omitted, and many of his contemporaries,
1699𓀴English as well as foreign, have noticed the magnificence and
1700𓀴stateliness of the ceremonious observances at his court. Jesse has
1701𓀴summarised a few of these notes, and it is well worth while to quote
1702𓀴some of his expressions. A few weeks after his elevation, we find
1703𓀴the Protector entertained by the citizens of London with all the
1704𓀴honours which, for centuries, they had been accustomed to pay to their
1705𓀴sovereigns on their accession. Monsieur De Bordeaux writes to De
1706𓀴Brienne, 23rd of February, 1654:—“On his solemn entry into the City he
1707𓀴was received like a king: the Mayor went before him with the sword in
1708𓀴his hand about him nothing but officers, who do not trouble themselves
1709𓀴much as to fineness of apparel; behind him the members of the Council
1710𓀴in State coaches, furnished by certain lords. The concourse of people
1711𓀴was great; wheresoever Cromwell came a great silence; the greater
1712𓀴part did not even move their hats. At the Guildhall was a great feast
1713𓀴prepared for him, and at the table sat the Mayor, the Councillors, the
1714𓀴Deputies of the Army, as well as Cromwell’s son and son-in-law. Towards
1715𓀴the Foreign Ambassadors, the Protector deports himself as a king, for
1716𓀴the power of kings is not greater than his.”
1717𓀴
1718𓀴Again, De Bordeaux writes a few weeks afterwards:—“Some say he will
1719𓀴assume the title and prerogatives of a Roman emperor. In order to
1720𓀴strengthen his party, he deals out promises to all parties. It is
1721𓀴here, however, as everywhere else; no government was or is right in
1722𓀴the people’s eyes, and Cromwell, once their idol, is now the object of
1723𓀴their blame, perhaps their hate.”
1724𓀴
1725𓀴There is a record of May Day in the same year, 1654. The writer is much
1726𓀴shocked at the licence that prevailed. There was “much sin committed by
1727𓀴wicked meetings, with fiddlers, drunkenness, ribaldry, and the like.”
1728𓀴Cromwell kept open house at Whitehall on Mondays. In 1657, the Speaker
1729𓀴announced to the House of Commons that the Lord Protector invited the
1730𓀴whole House to dinner in the Banqueting House, and he had similarly
1731𓀴received them the year before.
1732𓀴
1733𓀴Cromwell’s last illness seized him at Hampton Court. He was removed
1734𓀴to Whitehall. There, while a tremendous tempest howled round the old
1735𓀴walls, he breathed his last on the afternoon of the 3rd of September,
1736𓀴1658. The concourse of fanatical preachers which disturbed his last
1737𓀴moments seems to have been doubled at his death, and Tillotson, the
1738𓀴future Archbishop, describes Richard Cromwell as seated at one side of
1739𓀴a table with six divines at the other. Cromwell’s funeral took place
1740𓀴from Somerset House, not from Whitehall, so it does not specially
1741𓀴concern us. Suffice it to say here, that no king or queen has ever been
1742𓀴interred at so much cost or so magnificently.
1743𓀴
1744𓀴There is little except Tillotson’s note quoted above to connect
1745𓀴Richard Cromwell with Whitehall; but a meeting of discontented
1746𓀴officers which he permitted at Wallingford House, over the way,
1747𓀴precipitated his fall. It has always been asserted, apparently with
1748𓀴truth, that Oliver’s wife had been inclined to Royalism, and that she
1749𓀴pressed her husband to bring in the late King’s son. This did not,
1750𓀴however, prevent her from an endeavour to secure some of the royal
1751𓀴effects at Whitehall, when she, in her turn, received notice to quit.
1752𓀴Early in 1660 they were taken possession of by a Commission.
1753𓀴
1754𓀴For the next few years the name of Whitehall is chiefly to be found
1755𓀴in the delightful pages of Pepys, and those of that sanctimonious
1756𓀴prig, Evelyn. Mr. Wheatly, who has made a special study of Pepys,
1757𓀴tells us, in his _London, Past and Present_, that the chief apartments
1758𓀴of Whitehall mentioned in the _Diary_ are as follows:—The Matted
1759𓀴Gallery, the Gallery of Henry VIII., the Boarded Gallery, the Shield
1760𓀴Gallery, the Stone Gallery, and the Vane Room. We may identify some
1761𓀴of these. The Gallery of Henry VIII. was probably that which led over
1762𓀴Holbein’s Gate to the park. The Shield Gallery must be that spoken
1763𓀴of by Manningham, about the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as
1764𓀴being decorated with scutcheons. There was a Guardroom, mentioned by
1765𓀴Lilly, the astrologer. The Adam and Eve Gallery was so called from a
1766𓀴picture attributed to Mabuse, now at Hampton Court. The Stone Gallery
1767𓀴looked on the Sundial Lawn in the Privy Garden. Pepys also mentions
1768𓀴the Banqueting House, where in April, 1661, he “saw the King create my
1769𓀴Lord Chancellor, and several others, Earls, and Mr. Crew, and several
1770𓀴others, Barons: the first being led up by Heralds and five old Earls to
1771𓀴the King, and there the patent is read, and the King puts on his vest,
1772𓀴and sword and coronet, and gives him the patent. And then he kisseth
1773𓀴the King’s hand, and rises and stands covered before the King. And the
1774𓀴same for the Barons, only he is led up but by three of the old Barons,
1775𓀴and are girt with swords before they go to the King.” In the Banqueting
1776𓀴House, also, the King touched “people for the King’s evil” (June
1777𓀴23, 1660). There was a service “At the Healing” in Books of Common
1778𓀴Prayer. It was omitted, I think, about 1709. There was a “balcone” in
1779𓀴the Shield Gallery. In this room Pepys saw the King bid farewell to
1780𓀴Montagu, who was going to sea. “I saw with what kindness the King did
1781𓀴hug my lord at his parting.” We have a topographical note in July,
1782𓀴1660. Pepys walked all the afternoon in Whitehall Court. We know where
1783𓀴the Court was, and now we learn that the Council Chamber looked into
1784𓀴it. “It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare,
1785𓀴to see the King looking out of the Council window.” There are many
1786𓀴references to the Chapel. It stood near the river, in the eastern part
1787𓀴of the palace, and had two vestries. Inigo Jones designed a beautiful
1788𓀴reredos of coloured marbles for it. This reredos was saved when the
1789𓀴palace was burnt, and was given by Queen Anne to Westminster Abbey.
1790𓀴There is a view in Dart’s _Westminster Abbey_ which shows it—the only
1791𓀴representation of it I have met with. It was destroyed in the early
1792𓀴days of the so-called Gothic revival, and a piece of stucco-work by
1793𓀴Bernasconi took its place. That again was “restored” away in favour
1794𓀴of a very poverty-stricken piece of mosaic, which by some blunder was
1795𓀴made too small for its place, and had to be eked out with a meaningless
1796𓀴border. A small fragment of Inigo’s altar-piece is in the triforium.
1797𓀴
1798𓀴[Illustration: _Pyramidal Dial in Privy Garden, set up in 1669_.

1801𓀴
1802𓀴Pepys was much pleased (8th July, 1660) to hear the organ in Whitehall
1803𓀴Chapel. The old organs had been destroyed under the Commonwealth all
1804𓀴over the country, but now the diarist writes:—“Here I heard very good
1805𓀴music, the first time that ever I remember to have heard the organs and
1806𓀴singing men in surplices in my life.” There are many other mentions of
1807𓀴the chapel, and, on one occasion, Mr. Hill took him up to the King’s
1808𓀴Closet, a kind of gallery looking into the chapel, the King being
1809𓀴away—“and there we did stay all service-time, which I did think a great
1810𓀴honour.”
1811𓀴
1812𓀴He has something to say about the works of art at Whitehall. On one
1813𓀴occasion he admired “a great many fine antique heads of marble that
1814𓀴my lord Northumberland had given the King.” Next he inspected the
1815𓀴pictures. They consisted (1) of those sold by the Commonwealth and
1816𓀴recovered; (2) those retained by Cromwell; and (3) a collection which,
1817𓀴having been bought by a Dutchman from Whitehall, was obtained by the
1818𓀴States of Holland from his widow, and presented to Charles II. on
1819𓀴his restoration. The gallery which, as we shall see, is mentioned by
1820𓀴Evelyn, appears to have been used as a kind of drawing-room in the
1821𓀴evening.
1822𓀴
1823𓀴Pepys and his wife were present on one occasion when the Queen dined
1824𓀴at Whitehall. This Queen was Henrietta Maria, the widow of Charles
1825𓀴I. He describes her as in her Presence Chamber, and says she was a
1826𓀴very little, plain old woman, and nothing in her presence or her garb
1827𓀴different from any ordinary person. He goes on: “The Princess of Orange
1828𓀴I had often seen before. The Princess Henrietta is very pretty, but
1829𓀴much below my expectation; and her dressing of herself with her hair
1830𓀴frizzed short up to her ears, did make her seem so much the less to
1831𓀴me.” A little further on he tells of being locked by accident into
1832𓀴“Henry the Eighth’s Gallery,” and being unable to get into the Boarded
1833𓀴Gallery. In 1666, he mentions a dining-room, but where it was he does
1834𓀴not tell us. There are many other notices of Whitehall in the _Diary_,
1835𓀴but the foregoing are probably the most important.
1836𓀴
1837𓀴[Illustration: _Whitehall in 1724._]
1838𓀴
1839𓀴When we look at Vertue’s plan already mentioned, nothing is more
1840𓀴striking than the number of separate residences the palace contained.
1841𓀴The plan purports to have been made in the reign of Charles II., and is
1842𓀴dated 1680. There are, however, apparently, two or three anachronisms.
1843𓀴At least a score of dukes and other nobles had their quarters in the
1844𓀴palace, including Monk, now Duke of Albemarle, who, with his awful
1845𓀴Duchess, has the pleasant house by the Cockpit, occupied by Cromwell
1846𓀴before he became Protector. It is said to have been from this house
1847𓀴that the Princess Anne set off on her famous ride with the Bishop of
1848𓀴London, to meet William of Orange, in 1688. Lady Castlemaine, the
1849𓀴Duke of Monmouth, the Duke of Ormonde, and Captain Cooke, of whom
1850𓀴Pepys sometimes speaks in disparaging terms, and who was master of the
1851𓀴singing boys in the King’s Chapel, or something of the kind—all these
1852𓀴were close to the Cockpit. In the other part of Whitehall—east, that
1853𓀴is, of the “street”—were apartments for the King himself, the Queen,
1854𓀴the Maids of Honour, for Lord Bath, Lord Peterborough, the Duke of
1855𓀴Richmond, a Mrs. Kirk, a Lady Sears, and a vast number of people of
1856𓀴whom history has recorded but little, including “Mr. Chiffinch.” There
1857𓀴are, besides, a number of officials, such as the Cofferer, the Queen’s
1858𓀴Secretary and Waiters, the Treasurer, the Chamberlain, the Doctor,
1859𓀴and the pages of the back-stairs. A few years later an apartment
1860𓀴adjoining the Stone Gallery was granted to Louise Renée de Penancoet de
1861𓀴Keroualle, duchess of Portsmouth, whom Evelyn describes as having “a
1862𓀴childish, simple, and baby face.”
1863𓀴
1864𓀴Evelyn, like Pepys, makes occasional mention of Whitehall Chapel and of
1865𓀴the other buildings. We need not quote more than one or two. In April,
1866𓀴1667, he writes:—
1867𓀴
1868𓀴“22nd.—Saw the sumptuous supper in the banqueting house at Whitehall,
1869𓀴on the eve of St. George’s Day, where were all the companions of the
1870𓀴Order of the Garter.
1871𓀴
1872𓀴“23rd.—In the morning, his Majesty went to chapel with the Knights of
1873𓀴the Garter, all in their habits and robes, ushered by the heralds;
1874𓀴after the first service, they went in procession, the youngest first,
1875𓀴the Sovereign last, with the Prelate of the Order and Dean, who had
1876𓀴about his neck the book of the Statutes of the Order; and then the
1877𓀴Chancellor of the Order (old Sir Henry de Vic), who wore the purse
1878𓀴about his neck; then the Heralds and Garter-King-at-Arms, Clarencieux,
1879𓀴Black Rod. But before the Prelate and Dean of Windsor went the
1880𓀴gentlemen of the chapel and choristers, singing as they marched; behind
1881𓀴them two doctors of music in damask robes; this procession was about
1882𓀴the courts at Whitehall. Then, returning to their stalls and seats in
1883𓀴the chapel, placed under each knight’s coat-armour and titles, the
1884𓀴second service began. Then, the King offered at the altar, an anthem
1885𓀴was sung; then, the rest of the Knights offered, and lastly proceeded
1886𓀴to the banqueting house to a great feast. The King sat on an elevated
1887𓀴throne at the upper end at a table alone; the Knights at a table on
1888𓀴the right hand, reaching all the length of the room; over-against them
1889𓀴a cupboard of rich gilded plate; at the lower end, the music; on the
1890𓀴balusters above, wind music, trumpets, and kettle-drums. The King was
1891𓀴served by the lords and pensioners who brought up the dishes. About the
1892𓀴middle of the dinner, the Knights drank the King’s health, then the
1893𓀴King theirs, when the trumpets and music played and sounded, the guns
1894𓀴going off at the Tower. At the Banquet, came in the Queen, and stood by
1895𓀴the King’s left hand, but did not sit. Then was the banqueting-stuff
1896𓀴flung about the room profusely. In truth, the crowd was so great,
1897𓀴that though I stayed all the supper the day before, I now stayed no
1898𓀴longer than this sport began, for fear of disorder. The cheer was
1899𓀴extraordinary, each Knight having forty dishes to his mess, piled up
1900𓀴five or six high; the room hung with the richest tapestry.”
1901𓀴
1902𓀴Then comes the end in a well-known and oft-quoted passage. It was in
1903𓀴the winter of 1685. Why Evelyn visited Whitehall that particular Sunday
1904𓀴we do not know. His description of the scene at Whitehall the last
1905𓀴Sunday but one of the life of Charles II. is not new to any one, but
1906𓀴must come in here: “I can never forget,” he says, “the inexpressible
1907𓀴luxury and profaneness, gaming and all dissoluteness, and as it were
1908𓀴total forgetfulness of God (it being Sunday evening) which this day
1909𓀴se’nnight I was witness of, the King sitting and toying with his
1910𓀴concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Mazarine, etc.; a French boy
1911𓀴singing love-songs in that glorious gallery, whilst about twenty of
1912𓀴the great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at Basset round a
1913𓀴large table, a bank of at least 2000 in gold before them; upon which
1914𓀴two gentlemen who were with me made reflections with astonishment. Six
1915𓀴days after was all in the dust.”
1916𓀴
1917𓀴[Illustration: _Funeral of Queen Mary, 1694_.
1918𓀴
1919𓀴_From an Engraving by_ P. PERSOY.]
1920𓀴
1921𓀴James II. seems to have preferred St. James’s to Whitehall as a
1922𓀴residence during his brief and stormy reign. All his children were
1923𓀴born there, and there is an account of his Queen, Mary of Modena,
1924𓀴hastening from Whitehall just before the birth of the prince who became
1925𓀴subsequently the Old Pretender.
1926𓀴
1927𓀴William and Mary were hardly settled at Whitehall when they began
1928𓀴to look about for a house which would suit the King’s health. At
1929𓀴Whitehall he was constantly ill. The low, foggy, damp situation was
1930𓀴not calculated for a man who suffered daily from asthma and often from
1931𓀴ague or low fever. One day he looked at Holland House, and we read in
1932𓀴the Kensington parochial accounts of the church bells being rung as
1933𓀴he went through the suburban village. Holland House was perhaps too
1934𓀴far away; but William next visited what was really the old manor house
1935𓀴of Neyte, in Westminster, which was then called Nottingham House. It
1936𓀴was purchased for him, and renamed Kensington Palace, and henceforth
1937𓀴neither Whitehall nor St. James’s saw much of him or of Queen Mary,
1938𓀴except on state occasions. We gather from Evelyn that Charles II. had
1939𓀴given suites of apartments to the Duchess of Portsmouth, whom the
1940𓀴people called Madam Carwell, and others. The Duchess of Cleveland had a
1941𓀴house near St. James’s, and afterwards lived in Arlington Street. Nell
1942𓀴Gwynne lived in Pall Mall: so that of all those “curses of the nation,”
1943𓀴as Evelyn calls them, only this Frenchwoman remained. If we look at
1944𓀴Vertue’s map, though we shall not see any mention of the lodgings
1945𓀴of the Duchess, we do see an entry which, as it turns out, is more
1946𓀴important. It points out the room of the King’s laundress.
1947𓀴
1948𓀴She was a Dutchwoman at this time, and made a charcoal fire to dry a
1949𓀴shirt belonging to a Colonel Stanley. The situation of the room, if it
1950𓀴was the same as that of the laundress of King Charles, is precisely
1951𓀴that in which a fire, once set going, might spread in all directions,
1952𓀴as it was surrounded with small chambers, probably with wooden
1953𓀴partitions, and then again by chapels, libraries, galleries, halls, and
1954𓀴other inflammable buildings. The unhappy Dutchwoman set her room on
1955𓀴fire and perished in the flames. “The tapestry, bedding, the wainscotes
1956𓀴were soon in a blaze,” says Macaulay. “Before midnight, the King’s
1957𓀴apartments, the Queen’s apartments, the wardrobe, the treasury, the
1958𓀴office of the Privy Council, the office of the Secretary of State, had
1959𓀴been destroyed.” Evelyn mentions a second chapel as having been fitted
1960𓀴up for James II.: both perished. The guardroom also, and the glorious
1961𓀴gallery of which Evelyn speaks. The Banqueting House was saved, but
1962𓀴some pictures by Holbein in the Matted Gallery were burnt out, and
1963𓀴there was said to be considerable loss of life. We shall see presently
1964𓀴why so many valuable pieces of furniture and pictures were saved. Some
1965𓀴of them found their way across the park to St. James’s. Others went as
1966𓀴far out as Kensington, and are now to be found partly at Windsor and
1967𓀴partly at Hampton Court.

1978𓀴
1979𓀴The fire occurred on the night of the 4th January, 1698, and the King
1980𓀴returning from one of his expeditions to Holland, found his palace,
1981𓀴as he came up the river, in ruins. William himself acknowledges in a
1982𓀴letter to a foreign friend that the accident, as he calls it, affected
1983𓀴him less than it might another, because Whitehall was a place in which
1984𓀴he could not live. Several fires had occurred within a short time at
1985𓀴Whitehall, the most destructive being that by which in April, 1691, the
1986𓀴Duchess of Portsmouth was burnt out, after having had her house three
1987𓀴times rebuilt, a subject on which Evelyn enlarges in his usual pious
1988𓀴manner. The Duchess went to live in Kensington, and survived until far
1989𓀴on in the reign of George II. All these fires did damage, but that of
1990𓀴the 4th January, 1698, seems to have been almost or altogether confined
1991𓀴to the royal apartments. Macaulay’s account of the fire is enormously
1992𓀴exaggerated. The whole palace, on both sides of the “street of
1993𓀴Whitehall” was mainly intact still—a vast region stretching up beyond
1994𓀴Scotland Yard, and almost to Charing Cross. Abundant remains of the
1995𓀴Tudor period were still to be seen twenty years ago by those who sought
1996𓀴for them. I remember a pointed window in a basement as lately as 1877.
1997𓀴The fact is, this part of the palace was never destroyed by fire, but
1998𓀴perished gradually, being pulled down piecemeal, to make way for other
1999𓀴buildings, or falling into decay.
2000𓀴
2001𓀴The first fire destroyed the Stone Gallery and the rooms between it
2002𓀴and the river. This Stone Gallery, as already mentioned, ran along the
2003𓀴east side of the Privy Garden. It was not rebuilt, and the Duchess of
2004𓀴Portsmouth lost her house. After the second fire the ground was leased
2005𓀴out, and Pembroke House was built on it. I think it is now part of the
2006𓀴Board of Trade. The rest of the row is now called Whitehall Gardens,
2007𓀴a place in which many eminent people have lived, including Sir Robert
2008𓀴Peel, one of the Queen’s Premiers. Beyond, further south, was the
2009𓀴Bowling Green. Here Montagu House now stands. We may feel sure, when we
2010𓀴see how little was burnt, that William and Mary, if they had liked the
2011𓀴place, might easily have reinstated the royal lodgings.
2012𓀴
2013𓀴There is a curious print in Smith’s _Sixty-two Additional Plates_,
2014𓀴which seems to have puzzled some people. It represents Whitehall in a
2015𓀴bird’s-eye view in outline, and must have been drawn after the second
2016𓀴fire, as Pembroke House has been built. The original drawing was in
2017𓀴Crowle’s collection. Smith stumbles over it when he says, “The dotted
2018𓀴lines show the parts that were not penned in ‘by the artist.’” He
2019𓀴does not perceive that they mark places which had been burnt and had
2020𓀴not been rebuilt. For us this print is interesting, as showing what a
2021𓀴comparatively small part of the whole perished in the fire of 1698, and
2022𓀴it shows us also what is the true answer to a question often asked: Why
2023𓀴were not the pictures consumed? We can see now that they may have been
2024𓀴taken down, all but the Holbeins, which were painted on the walls and
2025𓀴ceiling of a chamber, and leisurely stored, probably in the Banqueting
2026𓀴House, to be removed to St. James’s and Kensington as convenient.
2027𓀴In the same way there was time to remove anything of value from the
2028𓀴chapel, including Inigo’s great marble reredos. Indeed, it may be
2029𓀴doubted if the chapel was burnt.

2034𓀴
2035𓀴At the beginning of the last century there remained the two gates. The
2036𓀴queer old Gothic King Street Gate was taken down in 1723. In 1759,
2037𓀴Holbein’s Gate was also removed, including, of course, the stairs and
2038𓀴gallery by which Charles I. entered the palace on that fatal 30th
2039𓀴January. The terra-cotta heads of the Cæsars eventually went to Hampton
2040𓀴Court. They are said to have been made by an Italian named Maiano. The
2041𓀴brick and stone-work were removed by the Duke of Cumberland to make a
2042𓀴triumphal arch at Windsor. They form now a green mound near the Long
2043𓀴Walk. Toby Rustat’s leaden statue of James II. still stands behind
2044𓀴the hall, and is popularly supposed to point to the spot on which
2045𓀴James’s father was beheaded. We have seen that this tragedy took place
2046𓀴at the other side of the hall. There was an immediate talk of a new
2047𓀴palace on this site, but it never came to anything. The second plan of
2048𓀴Inigo Jones, that of 1639, is sometimes said to have been consulted
2049𓀴by the authorities. Colen Campbell obtained it for his _Vitruvius
2050𓀴Britannicus_, as he says, “from that ingenious gentleman, William
2051𓀴Emmet, of Bromley, in the county of Kent, Esq., from whose original
2052𓀴drawings the following five plates are published, whereby he has made
2053𓀴a most valuable present to the sons of Art.” Was Mr. Emmet, that
2054𓀴ingenious gentleman, who seems otherwise unknown to fame, the architect
2055𓀴consulted by William’s Government?

2222𓀴electronic works
2223𓀴
2224𓀴1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™

2226𓀴and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
2227𓀴(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
2228𓀴the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
2229𓀴destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
2230𓀴possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
2231𓀴Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
2232𓀴by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
2233𓀴or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
2234𓀴
2235𓀴1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
2236𓀴used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
2237𓀴agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
2238𓀴things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
2239𓀴even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
2240𓀴paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
2241𓀴Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
2242𓀴agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
2243𓀴electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
2244𓀴
2245𓀴1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
2246𓀴Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
2247𓀴of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
2248𓀴works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
2249𓀴States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
2250𓀴United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
2251𓀴claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
2252𓀴displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
2253𓀴all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
2254𓀴that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
2255𓀴free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
2256𓀴works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
2257𓀴Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
2258𓀴comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
2259𓀴same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
2260𓀴you share it without charge with others.
2261𓀴
2262𓀴1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
2263𓀴what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
2264𓀴in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
2265𓀴check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
2266𓀴agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
2267𓀴distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
2268𓀴other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

2288𓀴
2289𓀴1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is

2292𓀴copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
2293𓀴the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

2298𓀴trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
2299𓀴
2300𓀴1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
2301𓀴with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
2302𓀴must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
2303𓀴additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
2304𓀴will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
2305𓀴posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
2306𓀴beginning of this work.

2311𓀴
2312𓀴1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
2313𓀴electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
2314𓀴prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

2318𓀴1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
2319𓀴compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
2320𓀴any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
2321𓀴to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
2322𓀴other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
2323𓀴version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
2324𓀴(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
2325𓀴to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
2326𓀴of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
2327𓀴Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
2328𓀴full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
2329𓀴
2330𓀴1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
2331𓀴performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
2332𓀴unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
2333𓀴
2334𓀴1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
2335𓀴access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
2336𓀴provided that:
2337𓀴
2338𓀴    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
2339𓀴        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
2340𓀴        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
2341𓀴        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
2342𓀴        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
2343𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
2344𓀴        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

2441𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
2442𓀴
2443𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
2444𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
2445𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
2446𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
2447𓀴from people in all walks of life.
2448𓀴
2449𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
2450𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
2451𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
2452𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
2453𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
2454𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
2455𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
2456𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
2457𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

2474𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
2475𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
2476𓀴
2477𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
2478𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
2479𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
2480𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
2481𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
2482𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
2483𓀴status with the IRS.
2484𓀴
2485𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
2486𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
2487𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
2488𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
2489𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
2490𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
2491𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
2492𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
2493𓀴
2494𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
2495𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
2496𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
2497𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
2498𓀴
2499𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
2500𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
2501𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
2502𓀴
2503𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
2504𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
2505𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
2506𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

2508𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
2509𓀴
2510𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
2511𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
2512𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
2513𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
2514𓀴volunteer support.
2515𓀴
2516𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
2517𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
2518𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
2519𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
2520𓀴edition.
2521𓀴
2522𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
2523𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
2524𓀴
2525𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
2526𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
2527𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
2528𓀴subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
