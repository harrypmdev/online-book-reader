104𓀴
105𓀴Horace Lestrange
 was intent upon his
 occupation; he was throwing stones
106𓀴into the lake. He
 did it with skill
 and success; he made each stone jump
107𓀴four times, but he was using only
 his outer layer of attention; his
108𓀴inner self was turning
 over and over
 again a personal problem; he would
109𓀴have said he was thinking it out,
 but this was a mistake. The case was
110𓀴very plain and required
 no thought;
 he was only feeling it over, probing
111𓀴sensation to find how much weight
 it would bear, and at what point his
112𓀴heart would cry out
 to him to stop.
 Ten years ago he had lost his wife,
113𓀴after one year’s
 marriage. Perhaps,
 if she had lived, he would have
114𓀴grown tired of her;
 but she was very
 beautiful, and she had died when
115𓀴love was new and every golden day
 of her presence a thing divine and
116𓀴separate, intolerable to lose.
117𓀴
118𓀴She had left him
 something; instead
 of her love and her ripened youth,
119𓀴she had given him
 a baby son; he had
 put the child in his sister’s care
120𓀴and gone abroad.
121𓀴
122𓀴Annette used to go to church very
 devoutly, and Horace went to please
123𓀴her. He tried to suppose
 that Providence
 was in the right, but he said
124𓀴to his oldest friend (and this was
 the only comment he was heard to make
125𓀴upon his grief):
126𓀴
127𓀴“It seems to me, Bambridge,
 love is rather a let in.”
128𓀴
129𓀴Bambridge cleared his
 throat sympathetically.
130𓀴
131𓀴“A deuced lot of things
 are,” he muttered.
132𓀴
133𓀴Annette had always thought
 Bambridge rather cynical.
134𓀴
135𓀴Time heals wounds,
 but it leaves scars.
 Ten years had done a great deal
136𓀴for Horace Lestrange. There was no
 mark of his great grief left; but
137𓀴although time works very well as a
 narcotic, it is not stimulating; it
138𓀴had not renewed Horace’s youth. He
 did not think of love now; he thought
139𓀴of marriage--comfortable,
 consoling marriage.
140𓀴
141𓀴The girl who had
 suggested this idea
 to him was a thoroughly nice girl,
142𓀴pretty, well-educated,
 and kind-hearted.
 She had been very good to
143𓀴Horace; they had rowed on the lake
 together, and her ways were energetic
144𓀴without hardness, and swift with
 grace. They had climbed some of the
145𓀴surrounding peaks side by side,
 and she had shown admirable
146𓀴characteristics--quietness, pluck,
 instantaneous obedience, and
147𓀴endurance. She was
 a good companion
 (she challenged no comparison with
148𓀴Annette, who was
 helpless, clinging,
 and thoroughly silly, the kind of
149𓀴woman whom--if she
 dies soon enough--a
 man never forgets). Edith’s hair
150𓀴and eyes were dark; she had a full
 sweet mouth and a round chin. She was
151𓀴quite thirty and she wouldn’t
 expect romance. . . .
152𓀴
153𓀴The last stone failed to jump four
 times; perhaps it didn’t agree with
154𓀴Horace that there is a
 time limit for romance.
155𓀴
156𓀴“It would be an excellent
 thing for
 the boy,” said Lestrange, putting
157𓀴his hands in his pockets. “Etta
 of course is a good woman; clever,
158𓀴plenty of tact, but
 she is so managing.
 I never knew such a woman; she
159𓀴sponges one up. She
 has been everything
 to the little chap though for
160𓀴the last eight years.
 I hope he won’t
 make a fuss at leaving her. I
161𓀴don’t think he will; Edith is good
 with kids. Well, I’ll go and look her
162𓀴up.”
163𓀴
164𓀴He went to look her
 up. She was usually
 easy to discover when Lestrange
165𓀴wanted her. She did not run after
 him, as a sillier woman would have
166𓀴done, neither did
 she run away from
 him, as young girls sometimes run
167𓀴from their lovers,
 but when he looked
 for her she was there. She sat
168𓀴under a big ilex
 tree on the terrace
 of the hotel garden. It was not
169𓀴easy to remember that it was an
 hotel, for once it had been an old
170𓀴Italian palace, and
 something of its
 ancient dignity remained. The lake
171𓀴lay at its foot, a
 vast and shimmering
 expanse of silver and azure. The
172𓀴mountains were half withdrawn into
 vague shadows; sometimes moonstone
173𓀴and sometimes purple, and when the
 wind blew aside their thin veil of
174𓀴mist, the sun shone over slopes
 vivid, luminous and green.
175𓀴
176𓀴Around Edith Walton
 were huge bushes
 of camellias, red and white and
177𓀴very splendid. A mad riot of roses
 flung itself over a pergola. In the
178𓀴distance a magnolia tree slowly
 opened wonderful flowers to the
179𓀴sun--flowers that seemed like the
 birth of spiritual treasures, white
180𓀴cloistered buds filled
 with aromatic fragrance.
181𓀴
182𓀴Edith sat quite still
 with her hands
 in her lap; there was something
183𓀴expectant in her appearance;
 it seemed
 part of the general hush. The
184𓀴wind had dropped suddenly and the
 tiny village lay embosomed on
185𓀴quivering water lines.
186𓀴
187𓀴Edith knew who was coming towards
 her, as flowers know the quickening
188𓀴soft rain of spring,
 and as the ocean
 knows the dominance of the tides.
189𓀴
190𓀴“You’ve got an awfully
 jolly corner,”
 said Lestrange rather awkwardly.
191𓀴
192𓀴“There are so many awfully jolly
 corners here,” said Edith. Then she
193𓀴smiled at him, the tender smile of
 a woman who laughs in secret triumph
194𓀴at the man she loves; she lets him
 think he is concealing his purpose
195𓀴from her, but she smiles.
196𓀴
197𓀴“I wish you weren’t
 going away to-morrow,”
 Lestrange began. He thought
198𓀴he was leading up to his goal with
 extraordinary skill and subtlety.
199𓀴“Must you really?”
200𓀴
201𓀴Edith hesitated; he would have
 to put it better than that.
202𓀴
203𓀴“I think my aunt has made all her
 arrangements,” she said. Then she
204𓀴looked away towards the lake over
 his shoulder. “I shall be sorry to
205𓀴leave--all this,” she
 murmured quietly.
206𓀴
207𓀴“I don’t see why
 you can’t stay with
 me,” said Lestrange, sitting down
208𓀴on the seat beside
 her. “I mean always.”
209𓀴
210𓀴He was certainly
 not putting it very
 well. Edith tried to believe that
211𓀴he was; she wanted to believe it.
 She looked at him, and her lips
212𓀴quivered. She was not an emotional
 woman; he had taken good care to find
213𓀴that out, but her dark eyes looked
 strange and stormy. She seemed as if
214𓀴she was feeling something
 strongly,
 almost more than she could bear.
215𓀴
216𓀴“Do you want me very
 much?” she murmured.
217𓀴
218𓀴Well, of course he
 wanted her. If you
 ask a woman to marry you, you must
219𓀴want her unless you
 are a young fool
 under the influence of glamour.
220𓀴There was no glamour.
 Horace had never
 pretended in his life, and he did
221𓀴not pretend now. He simply said:
222𓀴
223𓀴“It would make me very happy if
 you would be my wife, Edith.”
224𓀴
225𓀴“I should like so much to make you
 very happy,” said Edith. Then,
226𓀴suddenly, inconsequently, and very
 foolishly, she burst into tears.
227𓀴
228𓀴“Don’t, my dear--don’t,”
 he exclaimed
 hurriedly. He tried to take her
229𓀴hands from her face, but she would
 not let him. He looked at her in
230𓀴bewilderment; she shook with these
 astonishing sobs; and she was a most
231𓀴sensible woman, and thirty.
 He could not understand her.
232𓀴
233𓀴He kissed the clenched hands which
 covered her face, and almost as
234𓀴suddenly the sobs ceased. She drew
 in her breath with a quick sound. He
235𓀴walked to the balustrade and began
 to whistle. They were in a very
236𓀴secluded part of the
 gardens, but one
 never knew. No! fortunately there
237𓀴was no one in sight.
 What an extraordinary,
 lovely scene it was! Perhaps
238𓀴Edith would stop crying soon.
239𓀴
240𓀴She did; she brushed the tears
 from her eyes and laughed.
241𓀴
242𓀴“Oh, how silly you must think me!”
 she said. “And I’m thirty--you know
243𓀴I’m thirty?”
244𓀴
245𓀴“I think this is
 the third time that
 you have told me you are,” cried
246𓀴Horace. He came and
 sat down beside
 her again. She did not make him feel
247𓀴uncomfortable any more.
248𓀴
249𓀴“Do smoke,” said Edith quickly.
 “I know you’re dying to.”
250𓀴
251𓀴“Thanks, if I may.”
 He lit; a cigarette.
 And she saw with a sudden
252𓀴sinking of her heart that
 his hands were steady.
253𓀴
254𓀴“There is the little
 chap at home,”
 he said, turning his eyes to her
255𓀴with a restored friendliness.
 “You’re
 sure you won’t mind him?”
256𓀴
257𓀴“Oh, I shall love
 him!” said Edith.
 “Do you know--you must not be
258𓀴jealous, but that
 is half the reason
 why I am so--why I am going to
259𓀴marry you, you know!”
260𓀴
261𓀴Horace was not jealous. He was
 very pleased, and he said so.
262𓀴
263𓀴“But what,” Edith asked anxiously,
 “will your sister say, Horace?”
264𓀴
265𓀴“Oh, my sister!” stammered
 Lestrange.
 “Do you think she will mind very
266𓀴much?”
267𓀴
268𓀴“You darling stupid!” cried Edith.
 “She’ll mind most horribly.”
269𓀴
270𓀴Then she blushed; she hadn’t meant
 to call him “darling.” She looked at
271𓀴him anxiously, but he
 had not noticed it.
272𓀴
273𓀴“By Jove, I believe
 she will; you’re
 right, Edith. I’m afraid she’ll cut
274𓀴up frightfully rough!
 I thought I had
 managed to think it all out--about
275𓀴you, you know, and the little chap
 and me--and Annette, my dead wife.”
276𓀴
277𓀴He spoke these last
 words in a voice
 she had never heard him use before.
278𓀴But he spoke them bravely
 and honestly,
 with his eyes on hers. Her
279𓀴courage leapt to meet his.
280𓀴
281𓀴“My dear,” she said
 quickly, “I want
 you to behave as if I had loved her
282𓀴too. I want you to talk to me of
 her, to let her share our life, or
283𓀴rather to let me share yours and
 hers. I want you never to be afraid
284𓀴that I do not understand. I come
 to you to give you all the help and
285𓀴comfort that I can,
 but I come to you
 knowing that she has your heart.”
286𓀴
287𓀴Then Lestrange kissed
 her. The last
 hesitation fell away from this new
288𓀴purpose, the last
 cloud melted. His
 heart went out in friendship and
289𓀴gratitude to this
 woman who did not
 seek to rob him of his past. There
290𓀴was a moment’s splendid
 recognition
 between them, as strong as passion
291𓀴and as kind as love.
 Then the breathless
 hush of the air broke in a
292𓀴chill and sudden
 shower; they passed
 through the drenched garden quickly
293𓀴into the big hotel.
294𓀴
295𓀴
296𓀴                 
                  II
297𓀴
298𓀴When Miss Lestrange received the
 announcement of her brother’s
299𓀴engagement she replied by return
 of post, congratulating him on his
300𓀴prospective happiness. She called
 it prospective, but she allowed that
301𓀴it was happiness. She offered to
 give up her residence at Mallows,
302𓀴Horace’s place in the country, and
 suggested that perhaps she could take
303𓀴a villa by the seaside.
304𓀴
305𓀴“This,” she wrote, “would
 be very suitable
 for Leslie as well.” She took
306𓀴entirely for granted
 that she should
 keep the boy. Then she said to
307𓀴herself: “Edith Walton!
 What extraordinary
 people Horace picks up! One
308𓀴has never heard of her! There was
 a Lady Walton I remember meeting at
309𓀴Bournemouth; her husband probably
 got knighted for patent biscuits, or
310𓀴some vulgar charity; the Lindleys
 knew her. I will call on the
311𓀴Lindleys.”
312𓀴
313𓀴When Horace returned to London
 he found his home, as usual, the
314𓀴perfection of order.
 He was not a rich
 man, and he did not desire luxury
315𓀴or extravagance.
 He had never needed
 to desire them, for his sister had
316𓀴that genius for management
 which results
 in other people’s comfort. She
317𓀴oiled the wheels of
 life for her brother,
 and as yet she had charged him
318𓀴nothing for the oil.
 She was dressed
 for going out, but on his arrival
319𓀴she laid her card-case and parasol
 on the table and gave him her cheek
320𓀴to kiss. Miss Lestrange had been a
 plain, angular girl, without charms;
321𓀴but she was a di
stinguished-looking
 middle-aged woman with a pleasant
322𓀴manner. Her pleasant
 manner entirely
 hid from the world that she had a
323𓀴will of iron and an
 absorbing passion
 for her little nephew. She was
324𓀴famous for her kind
 heart, and made
 an excellent _confidante_; people
325𓀴talked of her as “a
 dear, kind old thing.”
326𓀴
327𓀴Her brother looked at
 her a little nervously.
328𓀴
329𓀴“You have received
 my letter?” said
 Miss Lestrange, sitting down again,
330𓀴and drawing on her
 gloves. “But, of
 course, there is a great deal to be
331𓀴talked over, isn’t
 there? We needn’t
 begin now. Do you want a meal or
332𓀴anything? Or do they
 give it to you
 on the train? It is so long since I
333𓀴have been on the Continent,
 but I understand
 that in America you can be
334𓀴shaved and have your
 corns cut, probably
 simultaneously, as you travel.”
335𓀴
336𓀴“I think I’ll ring for tea,” said
 Horace. “Where is the boy?”
337𓀴
338𓀴“I am afraid he is out
 with Mr. Flinders.
 I should have kept him in, of
339𓀴course, to meet you;
 but Mr. Flinders
 said it was such a perfect
340𓀴afternoon it seemed a pity to keep
 him in, and I never like to interfere
341𓀴with the tutor’s arrangements.
 Leslie sent you his love.”
342𓀴
343𓀴“Thanks,” said Horace,
 a little dryly.
 He fidgeted about the room; he
344𓀴hardly knew quite what he expected
 from Etta, but, by Jove! she needn’t
345𓀴go on smoothing her
 gloves--it made
 him feel cold between the shoulders.
346𓀴
347𓀴“I hope the cake
 is not heavy,” said
 his sister, rising to pour out his
348𓀴tea. “Mrs. Devon can’t
 make cakes--it
 is her only weakness; but there
349𓀴are some rather nice
 pink things over
 there from the confectioner’s.”
350𓀴
351𓀴Horace cleared his throat.
352𓀴
353𓀴“I wish you would take off your
 things, Etta,” he said with sudden
354𓀴irritation, “or not look as if you
 were being kept in by force, and
355𓀴meant to go out the
 moment I had swallowed
 my tea; it makes me nervous.”
356𓀴
357𓀴“Nervous, my dear
 boy? Lestranges are
 never nervous. What is the matter
358𓀴with you? I was going out calling,
 and I supposed you would want to go
359𓀴upstairs and tidy
 after your journey.
 But, of course, if you are
360𓀴nervous, and have anything
 on your mind--”
361𓀴
362𓀴Etta began unbuttoning her
 gloves. Her brother groaned.
363𓀴
364𓀴“No, hang it all, Etta; I’d rather
 wait till after dinner!”
365𓀴
366𓀴“Just as you like,”
 said Miss Lestrange.
 “I hope Miss--er--Walton, isn’t
367𓀴it?--is quite well?”
368𓀴
369𓀴“Oh, yes, Edith is
 all right, thanks.
 You might tell them, Etta, to let
370𓀴the little chap come into my study
 when he gets in from his walk.”
371𓀴
372𓀴“Oh, of course, Horace!”
373𓀴
374𓀴It may have been intention, or it
 may have been one of those fortunate
375𓀴accidents which happen
 to well-trained
 fighters, but Miss Lestrange’s
376𓀴attention was suddenly caught by a
 crooked picture. She turned back to a
377𓀴portrait of Annette hanging
 over the mantelpiece.
378𓀴
379𓀴“It is not hung quite
 straight,” she
 said in her pleasant, commonplace
380𓀴voice. “There, that’s
 better! Is there
 anything more you want, Horace?”
381𓀴
382𓀴Her brother’s answer was made from
 his teacup; it sounded very like
383𓀴“Damn!”
384𓀴
385𓀴Horace continued to be extremely
 nervous. He had meant to go and see
386𓀴Edith after dinner;
 she and her aunt,
 Lady Walton, had returned to town
387𓀴with him, but he couldn’t
 go to Edith,
 having arranged nothing whatever,
388𓀴and not even having mentioned that
 he intended to keep his boy.
389𓀴
390𓀴All through dinner Etta held the
 conversation and guided it as she
391𓀴chose. Mr. Flinders, the
 tutor, responded admirably.
392𓀴
393𓀴Miss Lestrange had a perfect tone
 with the tutor; she treated him with
394𓀴that deference which
 marks the difference
 in social value. Her delicate
395𓀴flattery was a restraint; it put
 him at once on the footing of an
396𓀴inferior position where
 she could afford
 to be delightful to him without
397𓀴his ever meeting her on her
 own level. It was too fine for
398𓀴condescension, too gracious for
 patronage; it was an “invulnerable
399𓀴nothing”; and yet
 you could no more
 have passed it than have walked
400𓀴through bayonets;
 and there was this
 added attraction, that the bayonets
401𓀴were garlanded with flowers.
402𓀴
403𓀴“It was such a pity Leslie behaved
 so badly this afternoon,” Miss
404𓀴Lestrange began.
 “Mr. Flinders felt
 that such direct disobedience must
405𓀴be punished, especially
 when it led
 to such a decided risk as the boy’s
406𓀴playing with whooping-cough
 children
 in the Park. So instead of being
407𓀴allowed to come and
 see you, Horace,
 he had to be packed off,
408𓀴supperless, to bed; but you will
 go up after dinner, I suppose?”
409𓀴
410𓀴“I should have gone up
 before,” interrupted
 Horace, “but they said--”
411𓀴
412𓀴“Yes, I think authority
 must be upheld,”
 said his sister. “You see, dear
413𓀴Horace, Mr. Flinders
 had already warned
 Leslie about the punishment.”
414𓀴
415𓀴She looked across at her brother,
 as if to say that the punishment was
416𓀴an absurd blunder of Mr. Flinders,
 which they must overlook, because
417𓀴although he was a
 very clever fellow,
 of course, and a clergyman’s son,
418𓀴and really quite a
 gentleman, still--
419𓀴
420𓀴Horace understood the
 look, and dropped
 the subject. He was a man who
421𓀴took almost everything
 very easily;
 but not quite everything.
422𓀴
423𓀴Mr. Flinders began to make some
 explanation, which Miss Lestrange
424𓀴promptly checked.
 She asked his advice
 about a book, and somehow or
425𓀴other Leslie’s punishment remained
 the tutor’s blunder, though this was
426𓀴the first time he
 had ever heard of
 it. He had probably misunderstood
427𓀴something Miss Lestrange had said
 to him; she had often observed that
428𓀴she was not a lucid talker; there
 were certain advantages which Mr.
429𓀴Flinders had had, and she had not,
 and this made it such a comfort to
430𓀴listen to him! Possibly this was
 one of the occasions in which the
431𓀴disadvantages had told.
432𓀴
433𓀴After dinner Horace went upstairs
 to see his boy; there were traces of
434𓀴tears on the child’s face, and he
 looked pathetically like his dead
435𓀴mother. He flung his arms around
 his father’s neck and began to sob.
436𓀴Leslie had inherited Annette’s
 weak constitution; he was a
437𓀴highly-strung, delicate
 little boy.
438𓀴
439𓀴“Oh, daddy, don’t--don’t--don’t!”
 he sobbed. “Oh, please, dear daddy,
440𓀴don’t! I will be good
 if you won’t marry her!”
441𓀴
442𓀴His father’s face
 grew suddenly very
 stern; he had meant to be the first
443𓀴to tell his son about Edith.
444𓀴
445𓀴“My dear old chap,”
 he said tenderly,
 sitting down on the bed beside the
446𓀴boy. “Edith is such a jolly girl;
 you will like her. Why, she’s pretty
447𓀴and kind, and awfully
 fond of boys!
 You have no idea what fun we’ll
448𓀴have. She has asked you to go
 with her to-morrow to the Zoo.”
449𓀴
450𓀴“I have been to the
 Zoo,” said Leslie.
451𓀴
452𓀴A firm little line came around his
 mouth. It used to come round his
453𓀴mother’s when she meant to get her
 way and she did not find it easy.
454𓀴Horace had not seen it often
 enough to remember it.
455𓀴
456𓀴“Oh, daddy, don’t make me go with
 her; I want to go away with
457𓀴auntie--oh, I do want
 to go away with
 auntie!” The sobs began to shake
458𓀴him again. “I have
 always had auntie,”
 he cried. “You see, daddy, I’ve
459𓀴always had auntie!”
460𓀴
461𓀴“But, boy, you don’t want to go
 away from me?” asked his father.
462𓀴
463𓀴There was a moment’s constrained
 silence, and then the child dragged
464𓀴himself out of his
 father’s arms and
 threw himself face downwards on his
465𓀴pillow.
466𓀴
467𓀴“Yes, I do,” he muttered
 petulantly.
 “I won’t stay with this new woman!
468𓀴I do want to go away!”
469𓀴
470𓀴The lines of pain on Horace’s face
 deepened. His heart seemed to
471𓀴contract as he looked
 at the golden
 curls on the pillow, and remembered
472𓀴those long golden
 curls he had played
 with and kissed. For a moment he
473𓀴turned away, regretful, sick, and
 undesirous as the child himself of
474𓀴“this new woman.” Then his manhood
 reasserted itself, and he remembered
475𓀴that this was after all only a
 childish fit of ignorant tears.
476𓀴
477𓀴He was not angry
 with the child; it
 did not occur to him to ask him who
478𓀴had given him this
 cruel fear of Edith.
 There were a good many things
479𓀴that never occurred
 to Horace Lestrange.
 They might have been convenient
480𓀴things to do; possibly
 they might have
 made life easy and happy for him,
481𓀴only he did not do
 them, that was all;
 he could not make the child tell
482𓀴tales.
483𓀴
484𓀴There was some one
 to be very angry
 with; that was a simplification. It
485𓀴might be Etta, but Lestrange was
 slow to think so. Hadn’t she
486𓀴congratulated him at
 once? And besides,
 he couldn’t think that Etta
487𓀴could poison a child’s
 mind. Perhaps
 it was that fool Flinders; he
488𓀴seemed a perfectly
 incompetent chap,
 and he might possibly have some
489𓀴sentimental theories
 on step-mothers.
 Anyhow, he would go downstairs and
490𓀴talk to Etta; meanwhile he stooped
 over the child and shook his shoulder
491𓀴gently.
492𓀴
493𓀴“Don’t cry, old man,”
 he said quietly.
 “I promise you, you will like
494𓀴this new friend. She doesn’t want
 to take your mother’s place, or
495𓀴anything; she is
 just a new friend.
 To-morrow you shall see her, and
496𓀴tell me what you feel. You needn’t
 go to the Zoo. Aunt Etta isn’t going
497𓀴away at present, and you shall
 see her whenever you like.”
498𓀴
499𓀴“Mr. Flinders said there was going
 to be great changes,” sobbed the boy.
500𓀴
501𓀴The father closed
 his lips suddenly;
 there was going to be one great
502𓀴change--and that would
 be Mr. Flinders.
 He recalled his sister’s glance
503𓀴at dinner; evidently Etta thought
 the man a fool too. He felt vaguely
504𓀴relieved to have found
 out that it was Flinders.
505𓀴
506𓀴
507𓀴                 
                 III
508𓀴
509𓀴Etta was sitting in
 the library doing
 church embroidery on a frame; it
510𓀴was a thing she did
 extremely well;
 in fact, she was a woman who never
511𓀴did anything badly; if
 there were possibilities
 of ignorance in her, she
512𓀴avoided those fields in which they
 might be betrayed. Horace did not
513𓀴want to talk to her
 while she worked;
 he was never quite sure that he
514𓀴had her whole attention; she might
 be counting stitches or planning
515𓀴patterns, and so
 miss his points. He
 knew, however, that it does not do
516𓀴to start an important conversation
 with a woman by establishing a
517𓀴grievance, so he
 did not ask her to
 stop; he merely found refuge in a
518𓀴succession of cigarettes.
519𓀴
520𓀴“Was it a surprise
 to you, Etta,” he
 began in an off-hand tone, “to hear
521𓀴of my engagement?”
522𓀴
523𓀴Etta took up a thread
 of pink silk,
 and then decided for pale blue.
524𓀴
525𓀴“I don’t know that
 engagements ever
 surprise me,” she replied. “If men
526𓀴can afford to marry, and there is
 no other impediment, they generally
527𓀴do; and if they are attractive
 to women, they always do.”
528𓀴
529𓀴“You mean if women attract
 them?” he interjected.
530𓀴
531𓀴“My dear boy,” said
 his sister, moving
 the frame slightly more under the
532𓀴electric light, “it never does to
 confuse cause and effect. If women
533𓀴want to marry a man,
 he marries. In
 your case, of course, there was some
534𓀴protection provided
 you remained at
 home; the rest was merely a question
535𓀴of time.”
536𓀴
537𓀴Horace did not like
 this way of putting
 the matter at all; in the first
538𓀴place, it was an insult to Edith,
 and in the second place it was an
539𓀴insult to his own intelligence. He
 had thought the thing out so often,
540𓀴and had acted so
 entirely as a free
 agent; and yet the more emphasis he
541𓀴laid on this fact,
 the more plainly
 he saw the pleasant, unconvinced
542𓀴smile upon his sister’s
 face; besides,
 it wasn’t the point of the
543𓀴discussion; they seemed
 strangely incapable
 of reaching the point of the
544𓀴discussion.
545𓀴
546𓀴“I am sure when you see Edith,” he
 said at last, “you will feel that I
547𓀴have made a most
 desirable choice.”
 He tried to put it as baldly as
548𓀴possible, for he did not wish Etta
 to think he had been swayed by
549𓀴glamour.
550𓀴
551𓀴“Walton!” said his sister slowly:
 “who are the Waltons? Has the yellow
552𓀴silk skein fallen at
 your feet, Horace?”
553𓀴
554𓀴“I don’t know that
 they are anybody
 in particular,” said Horace, vaguely
555𓀴uncomfortable; “she’s
 an orphan, you
 know, and Lady Walton, her aunt, is
556𓀴an extremely clever,
 amusing woman.
 Edith has not gone in for Society
557𓀴much, she’s so fond of travel, and
 her aunt’s rather an invalid, so I
558𓀴imagine they have always
 lived extremely quietly.”
559𓀴
560𓀴“I can’t remember,”
 said Etta, “whether
 it was biscuits or soap the
561𓀴Lindleys told me; perhaps
 it was soap.”
562𓀴
563𓀴“What was soap?” said Horace,
 now thoroughly irritated.
564𓀴
565𓀴“What the man Walton,
 you know, was
 knighted for,” said his sister,
566𓀴calmly stitching at a wild rose.
 “Is she a lady by birth?”
567𓀴
568𓀴“The question did not arise,” said
 Horace rather grimly, “and if such
569𓀴questions do not arise,
 the references
 are usually satisfactory.”
570𓀴
571𓀴“Usually,” agreed his sister,
 “but not always, Horace.”
572𓀴
573𓀴“You speak in a very
 mysterious way,
 my dear. May I ask if you have a
574𓀴secret up your sleeve--what
 do they
 call those things in the ‘Family
575𓀴Herald’?--‘an ugly
 secret.’ Have you
 discovered that Lady Walton’s name
576𓀴was Smith?”
577𓀴
578𓀴“I don’t know what
 her name was,” said
 Miss Lestrange, and for a moment
579𓀴she pushed the screen
 away from her.
 “The whole family seem slightly
580𓀴obscure, but I supposed
 Miss Walton’s
 aunt could hardly be a person of
581𓀴much discrimination
 (I am sure I can
 be revealing no secret to you, my
582𓀴dear Horace, as you must know all
 about the thing already)--but how
583𓀴could any one who was a lady allow
 her niece to compromise herself quite
584𓀴as madly on the eve
 of her first London
 season? People of our sort don’t
585𓀴do that kind of thing.”
586𓀴
587𓀴“Pray explain yourself,
 Etta,” said
 Horace, getting up and standing in
588𓀴front of the mantelpiece, where he
 could look down on his sister. “I
589𓀴know nothing of what
 you say. Perhaps
 you have heard some malicious or
590𓀴stupid gossip which
 it is your duty
 to tell me, and mine to contradict.”
591𓀴
592𓀴“I hardly think you
 could do anything
 so foolish as to contradict
593𓀴gossip, my dear Horace, unless
 you wish to revive it; but I will
594𓀴certainly tell you
 what the Lindleys
 told me, and doubtless Edith will
595𓀴find it easy to explain.
 She was found
 staying on the Lake of Como--at
596𓀴the same place, I believe, where
 your engagement took place--with a
597𓀴disreputable woman--a woman about
 whose career there was no shadow of
598𓀴doubt. The Lindleys knew all about
 her, and this woman and Miss Walton
599𓀴were requested to leave the hotel.
 The peculiar part of the whole story
600𓀴is that the aunt and Miss Walton’s
 maid left previously, having
601𓀴apparently discovered
 the character
 of Miss Walton’s companion, and
602𓀴leaving the niece alone with her.
 I told the Lindleys, of course, that
603𓀴there must be some
 perfectly obvious
 explanation, but the fact remains
604𓀴the girl never did come out, and
 that she and her aunt have traveled
605𓀴about more or less ever since.
 I am, I must confess, a little
606𓀴disappointed that you have not
 got an explanation for me.”
607𓀴
608𓀴“There will be no difficulty about
 that,” said Horace quietly.
609𓀴
610𓀴“None, of course,” said his sister
 in courteous agreement. Then there
611𓀴was a pause.
612𓀴
613𓀴Etta continued to
 embroider, but she
 felt flushed and uncomfortable. So
614𓀴far she had simply skirmished; the
 real battle lay ahead. She had
615𓀴counted on her brother opening the
 subject, but he opened nothing. He
616𓀴stood before the
 closed door of her
 future apparently with far more
617𓀴comfort and unconcern than she
 did. Even a clever woman is at a
618𓀴disadvantage with
 a silent man; she
 has no weapon to pierce his armor.
619𓀴Her final onslaught
 had not disconcerted
 him so much as she had hoped.
620𓀴Evidently she was going to have to
 deal with an intelligent woman; no
621𓀴mere fool could have
 won such entire
 confidence from her brother, and
622𓀴without any of the distortions of
 love. Miss Lestrange saw perfectly
623𓀴well that Horace was not in love
 with the girl; she had guessed this
624𓀴from his letter--but she knew it
 the moment she saw him. It gave her
625𓀴unconcealed satisfaction,
 but at the
 same time it was puzzling that he
626𓀴seemed unshaken after her little
 story; she was certain of all the
627𓀴facts. She knew the importance of
 the unembellished, and she never
628𓀴risked an exaggeration
 with her brother.
 Lestranges did not understand
629𓀴exaggeration--at least, the male
 branch never did; if they found you
630𓀴inaccurate they had
 a tiresome habit
 of never accepting what you said
631𓀴without proof. Horace
 had never found
 Etta inaccurate; he had only once
632𓀴or twice thought she was mistaken.
633𓀴
634𓀴Miss Lestrange fidgeted for
 a few minutes, then she said:
635𓀴
636𓀴“Do you think that
 a woman, however
 innocent, who is under such a cloud,
637𓀴is fit to be in the position
 of mother to Annette’s boy?”
638𓀴
639𓀴“I will make every
 inquiry,” said Horace
 reflectively, “and, by the bye,
640𓀴Etta, Flinders must go. I
 don’t approve of Flinders.”
641𓀴
642𓀴“I think myself,” said Etta, “that
 he has taken rather too much upon his
643𓀴shoulders lately.
 You see, you were
 so long abroad, and yet you were his
644𓀴master. Whereas I was hardly in
 a position to dictate to him.”
645𓀴
646𓀴“I shall speak to him
 to-night,” said Horace.
647𓀴
648𓀴Miss Lestrange put
 down her embroidery
 and faced her brother.
649𓀴
650𓀴“Horace,” she said,
 “I hope you found
 Leslie reconciled to the idea of
651𓀴this great change?
 I did not like to
 speak to him about it myself. I am
652𓀴not an emotional woman,
 but my feelings
 for you and for your boy have
653𓀴been very strong. I did not trust
 myself to say much. I told Mr.
654𓀴Flinders that nothing must be said
 to prejudice him against his future
655𓀴step-mother, and then I left
 the subject to you to explain.”
656𓀴
657𓀴“He does not seem to have carried
 out your orders, Etta.”
658𓀴
659𓀴“Oh, my dear Horace,”
 she cried with
 a sudden note of anxiety in her
660𓀴voice, “how dreadful--how
 _very_ dreadful!”
661𓀴
662𓀴“It is exceedingly
 tiresome, of course,
 but I fancy the boy will soon
663𓀴take to Edith; she is
 clever with children.”
664𓀴
665𓀴Miss Lestrange rose to her feet;
 she looked agitated, plain, and
666𓀴awkward; her hands trembled and
 she gathered her sewing materials
667𓀴together. (There was the making
 of an excellent actress about Miss
668𓀴Lestrange.)
669𓀴
670𓀴“My dear boy,” she
 said solicitously,
 “I haven’t liked to bother you
671𓀴about it while you
 were away--these
 things are so intangible--but Dr.
672𓀴Bossage isn’t quite
 pleased with Leslie’s
 health, his constitution is so
673𓀴delicate; he takes after Annette.
 You know I have been almost
674𓀴excessively careful
 of him. I spoke
 to Bossage last week about the
675𓀴impending change,
 and he said it would
 be a very serious matter unless
676𓀴the boy really took
 to her. I blame
 myself, Horace, for not having
677𓀴conquered my feelings
 and spoken to
 Leslie strongly in her favor; but
678𓀴the Lestranges have
 always been sincere;
 there was this story against
679𓀴her. I was too cautious. I waited.
 I am afraid I may have done
680𓀴incalculable harm--”
 She stopped breathless.
 Horace eyed her gravely.
681𓀴
682𓀴“Is that all?” he asked
 as she finished.
683𓀴
684𓀴“You had better go and see Bossage
 yourself,” said Miss Lestrange; “he
685𓀴strongly advised my taking the boy
 to live in the country or by the sea
686𓀴for a year or two, till he becomes
 definitely strong. I daresay you
687𓀴remember my having mentioned it to
 you in my last letter? Of course,
688𓀴should you think it
 best, I will take
 him with pleasure. I have already
689𓀴told you that I will
 send to Mallows
 for all my little things.”
690𓀴
691𓀴“You know you needn’t
 do that, Etta;
 Mallows is as much your home as
692𓀴mine. Edith and I
 will run down when
 we like, but I most certainly wish
693𓀴you to remain there,”
 interrupted her brother.
694𓀴
695𓀴Miss Lestrange bowed her head.
696𓀴
697𓀴“That is like your
 generosity, Horace,”
 she replied slowly. “I accept.
698𓀴Now I am sure you wish to go and
 see Edith before it is too late.”
699𓀴(“Edith” was a distinct
 concession,
 but Miss Lestrange knew the value of
700𓀴inconclusive concessions.)
 “By-and-by
 you will tell me what you two are
701𓀴going to do about the boy. I hope,
 even if you decide to disregard
702𓀴Bossage, you will
 let him come away
 with me after your marriage, till
703𓀴you get settled, and
 it is convenient
 for you to have him back.”
704𓀴
705𓀴After all, she hadn’t put him in a
 corner--she hadn’t tied him down nor
706𓀴asked him for a promise, or made
 a scene. She had done none of the
707𓀴things he had feared;
 she had merely
 given him “rope enough to hang
708𓀴himself,” and then let him go
 to accomplish the performance.
709𓀴
710𓀴Horace did not know
 what had happened;
 he felt, indeed, vaguely
711𓀴uncomfortable. There
 was the strange
 story about Edith--pure folly but
712𓀴still strange--and there was this
 news of his boy’s health and his
713𓀴evident frightened
 horror of the new
 relationship. He might go and see
714𓀴Bossage, but he had
 a horror of going
 to see doctors--a horror born of
715𓀴terrible useless hours,
 while hideous,
 unavailing efforts were being
716𓀴made to stop the feeble ebbing of
 Annette’s little life. No, he wasn’t
717𓀴going to see doctors!
 But Edith was
 so keen to have the little chap. It
718𓀴was hard on Edith.
 (He did not consider
 it was hard upon himself--he was
719𓀴not apt to take that
 view of misfortune.)
 They had talked about him for
720𓀴hours, and it had
 all been so natural
 and right and easy--their future
721𓀴life together had
 been built around
 Annette’s son; the picture seemed
722𓀴suddenly a piece of vacant canvas
 brushed out by ineffaceable hygienic
723𓀴whitewash.
724𓀴
725𓀴There was only one thing to be
 done. He would dismiss Flinders.
726𓀴
727𓀴Mr. Flinders had,
 perhaps, some right
 to consider himself in after years
728𓀴an ill-used man. He had been given
 notice with implacable and relentless
729𓀴abruptness; no explanation
 had been
 given or listened to. If Lestrange
730𓀴had not been so extremely
 quiet, Mr.
 Flinders would have thought he was
731𓀴dealing with a man who
 was in a dangerous
 rage; as it was, he merely
732𓀴clung to the idea (which was not
 originally perhaps his own) that
733𓀴Lestrange was a well-meaning fool,
 governed by a tyrannical and scheming
734𓀴adventuress.
735𓀴
736𓀴Miss Lestrange, who
 was most sympathetic
 about it next morning, assured
737𓀴him of the fact.
738𓀴
739𓀴“It is natural,” she
 said graciously,
 “for people like yourself, Mr.
740𓀴Flinders, with your
 high ideals and
 great independence of spirit, to be
741𓀴surprised at such strong
 and regrettable
 influence wielded over a man
742𓀴like my brother,
 but the Lestranges
 are well known to be, as a family,
743𓀴very susceptible
 to women. I regret
 your going extremely. I spoke to my
744𓀴brother for you, but I am sorry to
 say I found him quite intractable on
745𓀴that and many other
 subjects. You must
 write and let me know how you are
746𓀴getting on. Life is so
 difficult, isn’t it?”
747𓀴
748𓀴Miss Lestrange was
 fond of speaking
 of Life or Destiny as being gigantic
749𓀴monsters with invincible powers,
 and yet there were times when she
750𓀴manipulated these
 great forces very
 easily. Mr. Flinders left her more
751𓀴struck than ever by
 her genuine qualities.
752𓀴
753𓀴“I daresay she will miss me too,”
 he said to himself with pleasant
754𓀴regretfulness. “I may have been of
 some use to her,” and there was no
755𓀴doubt that in this
 particular deduction
 Mr. Flinders was right.
756𓀴
757𓀴
758𓀴                 
                  IV
759𓀴
760𓀴Lady Walton was a woman who never
 did anything with her hands. She was
761𓀴content to sit for hours at a time
 thinking--“doing nothing,” her
762𓀴acquaintances called it. Certain
 hours in the day she read, but she
763𓀴never opened a modern
 book of any kind.
764𓀴
765𓀴“I have a feeling,”
 she said to her
 niece, “that they would revive a
766𓀴very painful experience
 I once received
 of a kitchen-maid in hysterics.
767𓀴People used to accept
 life and make
 their appeal to the intellect; now
768𓀴they spend their time screaming
 at natural laws and living for the
769𓀴emotions. It is a
 mysterious modern
 compulsion which used to be called
770𓀴selfishness. When I hear you begin
 to talk of your temperament, my dear
771𓀴Edith, I shall cease to ask
 you to run my errands.”
772𓀴
773𓀴Edith stroked her aunt’s hand
 and smiled at her; but she was
774𓀴preoccupied; she was
 expecting Horace.
775𓀴
776𓀴“Sometimes, Edith,
 you disappoint me.
 I have an impression that all the
777𓀴wisdom of all the ages, including
 my own, would have less effect upon
778𓀴your intelligence
 than the sound (I
 suppose they have no creak) of an
779𓀴ordinary pair of
 Bond Street boots.”
780𓀴
781𓀴“Well, he is rather
 late,” said Edith.
782𓀴
783𓀴“He is talking with his sister,”
 suggested Lady Walton. “I must
784𓀴congratulate you,
 my dear, in having
 chosen a husband who has complete
785𓀴ignorance of women.
 It is a very valuable
 attribute nowadays, when women
786𓀴have no restraint
 and men no manners.
 Horace is doubtless explaining to
787𓀴Miss Lestrange what an
 excellent arrangement
 his marriage will be for
788𓀴everybody concerned;
 and Miss Lestrange
 is turning his attention to
789𓀴awkward details. I
 hope you are prepared
 for complications, Edith; the
790𓀴maternal instinct of maiden aunts
 is a very fierce thing to combat. Do
791𓀴you realize that she may
 refuse to let the boy go?”
792𓀴
793𓀴The girl moved restlessly.
794𓀴
795𓀴“Oh, she can’t!” she
 murmured. “After
 all, Horace is very strong; he’s
796𓀴not a weak man, auntie.”
797𓀴
798𓀴“There is nothing so vulnerable as
 some kinds of strength,” said Lady
799𓀴Walton, with a sigh,
 “or so invulnerable
 as some kinds of weakness. What
800𓀴is tyranny but weakness playing
 on generosity, and how long do you
801𓀴suppose it can last? It can last
 as long as the generosity.”
802𓀴
803𓀴Edith shivered a little.
804𓀴
805𓀴“But he’ll think of me,” she said.
 “He knows how I want his child.”
806𓀴
807𓀴“He’ll think of you,”
 said her aunt
 very slowly; “yes, he’ll think of
808𓀴you, Edith; but thought
 doesn’t compel--there
 is only one compulsion.”
809𓀴
810𓀴It was surgery for
 the sake of healing,
 but the knife struck deep.
811𓀴
812𓀴Lady Walton sat quite
 still; she did
 not attempt to touch or soothe the
813𓀴girl; she did not
 even look at her.
 After a while she said reflectively:
814𓀴
815𓀴“If you had been
 ten years, or even
 five years younger, Edith, I should
816𓀴have forbidden this
 marriage; but you
 have learnt self-control; you know
817𓀴what you are marrying for--and you
 won’t fail to receive it, because you
818𓀴are not fool enough to spend your
 time crying for the moon. Crying for
819𓀴the moon is an injurious
 element in
 married life. It is not the kind of
820𓀴thing one gets.”
821𓀴
822𓀴Edith lifted her
 eyes to her aunt’s.
823𓀴
824𓀴“I have asked myself sometimes why
 I am doing it,” she said, and her
825𓀴voice sounded hard and strained.
 “I am not a fool of twenty, as you
826𓀴say--but Horace could have given
 me the moon, only he has given it
827𓀴already. And--and what is so much
 more, auntie, I could have given him
828𓀴back the moon’s equivalent.
 I could
 have filled his life with happiness,
829𓀴and he can’t take it!”
830𓀴
831𓀴“Well,” said Lady Walton, “do you
 regret what you are going to do?”
832𓀴
833𓀴Edith hesitated a moment. Then she
 said: “Yes, and I’m going to do it.”
834𓀴
835𓀴“I think I hear the taxi which is
 the preliminary of the Bond Street
836𓀴boots,” said her aunt, “and if you
 will excuse me, my dear, I will go to
837𓀴bed. It is a quarter
 to ten; you will
 send him away at half-past, cry
838𓀴for half-an-hour,
 and then go to bed.”
839𓀴
840𓀴“Oh, I sha’n’t cry!” said Edith,
 rising and resting her head on the
841𓀴mantelpiece. “I don’t cry.”
842𓀴
843𓀴“Ah!” replied Lady Walton, “that’s
 a great pity, my dear, because in
844𓀴that case you won’t
 sleep. However,
 we each have our own method.”
845𓀴
846𓀴It seemed a long time
 to Edith before
 the owner of the Bond Street boots
847𓀴came upstairs.
848𓀴
849𓀴She was a woman with
 a strong sense
 of humor, and so she spent the time
850𓀴laughing because it
 seemed so extremely
 amusing to receive a man who is
851𓀴going to marry you
 with a little more
 than the kindness of a friend and
852𓀴a little less than the freedom
 of a lover. What made it seem so
853𓀴especially funny to Edith was that
 she loved him; and it did not occur
854𓀴to her any the less sad because it
 was funny, or any the less funny
855𓀴because it was sad.
856𓀴
857𓀴Horace entered, looking
 glum; he was
 feeling--as he phrased it--“a bit
858𓀴of a fool.” An ecstatic
 or an anxious
 welcome would have annoyed him.
859𓀴Edith met his eyes
 smiling, but she
 did not rise from her chair nor did
860𓀴she burst into nervous questions;
 she merely said:
861𓀴
862𓀴“My aunt told me to
 tell you, Horace,
 that she was suffering from an
863𓀴acute attack of discretion,
 so that
 she would be unable to see you this
864𓀴evening; it is usually followed by
 a relapse into curiosity, which she
865𓀴expects to take place
 to-morrow; and
 you may stay until half-past ten.”
866𓀴
867𓀴Horace sat down beside
 her and smiled.
 It was really very peaceful and
868𓀴jolly; the place seemed
 full of flowers;
 it was almost like their being
869𓀴together at Como.
 Edith was dressed
 in pale soft green; he liked it
870𓀴extremely. He took
 her hand and held it.
871𓀴
872𓀴“Well, I’m rather
 glad we’re alone,”
 he said. “I’m afraid I’m awfully
873𓀴late, but I couldn’t help it.
 Etta kept me such a confounded
874𓀴time--bush-beating--and then I had
 to send off the tutor, who’s a
875𓀴beast--and has frightened the
 little chap silly about you; and
876𓀴altogether it’s been rather
 a rough passage.”
877𓀴
878𓀴“Poor Horace,” said Edith softly,
 “what a shame! But you mustn’t be
879𓀴worried; we’ll straighten it
 all out between us somehow.”
880𓀴
881𓀴“But you won’t like
 it--you won’t like
 it, Edith!” he exclaimed, looking
882𓀴at her with helpless,
 appealing eyes.
883𓀴
884𓀴It was a look which women who love
 know how to answer--when they are
885𓀴loved in return.
 Edith drew a sudden
 quick breath, then she said:
886𓀴
887𓀴“My dear boy, I didn’t expect we’d
 get everything all at once; it
888𓀴wouldn’t be any fun
 if we did. Why,
 it’s a regular campaign, and this is
889𓀴the first skirmish.”
890𓀴
891𓀴“No, it’s defeat, Edith,” he said,
 more quietly. “I’m afraid it’s
892𓀴defeat.”
893𓀴
894𓀴“Then tell me,” she answered.
 “I can bear defeat, Horace.”
895𓀴
896𓀴He looked into her honest, gallant
 eyes and blessed her; he blessed her
897𓀴for her courage; and he might have
 kissed her if he had thought about
898𓀴it. He told her about
 the boy’s delicacy
 and the doctor’s orders. She
899𓀴asked him one question:
900𓀴
901𓀴“If you hadn’t met
 me, could you have
 lived with him in the country?”
902𓀴
903𓀴“Oh, no!” said Horace. “I couldn’t
 get up to town and back from Mallows
904𓀴for my work--we should
 have had to be parted.”
905𓀴
906𓀴They were both silent
 for a little,
 then she drew his hand up against
907𓀴her cheek.
908𓀴
909𓀴“We’ll go down all
 your holidays to
 Mallows,” she said. “Every single
910𓀴one, Horace!”
911𓀴
912𓀴“But don’t you--don’t you mind?”
 he stammered, puzzled.
913𓀴
914𓀴Edith turned her eyes
 on his, still smiling.
915𓀴
916𓀴“We’ve got to mind,” she murmured;
 “but may I just see him first?”
917𓀴
918𓀴“Yes, of course, to-morrow,” said
 Horace quickly. “I think the whole
919𓀴thing’s rather devilish, you know,
 Edith. I can’t quite follow it. They
920𓀴never told me before
 about the little
 chap, and they seem to have turned
921𓀴him against the very
 idea of you and
 all that, you know; and he’s such a
922𓀴loving little fellow
 really, and he
 said he wanted to go away and leave
923𓀴me--”
924𓀴
925𓀴Horace’s voice broke
 and Edith winced.
 She looked away from him, and he
926𓀴recovered himself in a moment.
927𓀴
928𓀴“And Etta has got
 hold of some wild
 tale about you,” he went on. “I
929𓀴don’t like to speak
 to you about it,
 dear--it’s all a stupid bottomless
930𓀴impertinence--but, of course,
 I had to tell her I’d ask you.”
931𓀴
932𓀴“You may ask me anything
 you like, Horace.”
933𓀴
934𓀴“Thank you, darling! Do you know
 I always thought you were awfully
935𓀴sensible, but I never
 knew how sensible
 you were before to-night.”
936𓀴
937𓀴Edith gave a long, low laugh.
938𓀴
939𓀴“Sensible? I’m so
 glad you think I’m
 sensible, Horace!” she murmured.
940𓀴
941𓀴“Yes, I do,” he said with admiring
 emphasis. “I think you’re the most
942𓀴sensible woman I ever met.”
943𓀴
944𓀴Edith stopped laughing.
945𓀴
946𓀴“And the story, Horace?”
947𓀴
948𓀴“Well, were you ever on the Lake
 of Como staying with rather an odd
949𓀴person--ten years
 ago?” he began. He
 had released her hands now and sat
950𓀴looking red and foolish
 and staring
 in front of him. Edith leaned back
951𓀴in her chair and regarded him
 with a twinkle in her eye.
952𓀴
953𓀴“Yes,” she said,
 “I was. I stayed at
 Bellagio ten years ago with my aunt
954𓀴and her maid--”
955𓀴
956𓀴“And that’s all?” he asked,
 glaring at the carpet.
957𓀴
958𓀴“No--that’s not all,”
 said Edith in
 a low voice. “It’s a long story, and
959𓀴I thought perhaps
 I wouldn’t tell you;
 my aunt wanted me to, but it was
960𓀴a very sad story, and it happened
 so long ago I hoped people had
961𓀴forgotten; although I might have
 known that people’s memory for the
962𓀴unfortunate lasts as long as their
 oblivion of the happier star. You
963𓀴have observed to-night that I am a
 sensible woman, Horace; what is your
964𓀴definition of a sensible woman?”
965𓀴
966𓀴He hesitated.
967𓀴
968𓀴“Well, hang it all,
 I don’t know how
 to define things, but I suppose I
969𓀴meant a woman who wasn’t
 foolish--never
 made a fuss, or scenes, or
970𓀴mistakes, or did--well,
 stupid things, you know.”
971𓀴
972𓀴“Then,” said Edith,
 smiling demurely,
 “as a girl I think I must have
973𓀴answered to your description of a
 foolish woman, Horace. I don’t know
974𓀴that I made scenes,
 but I certainly
 did what people call foolish things,
975𓀴and I behaved, as my aunt would no
 doubt tell you, as an idiot; at the
976𓀴time you mention she called
 me a suicidal idiot!
977𓀴
978𓀴“To begin with, I must tell you
 I am very susceptible to beauty. I
979𓀴probably shouldn’t have tolerated
 you nearly as well if it hadn’t been
980𓀴for your extremely
 handsome nose--you
 needn’t blush--it is handsome, and
981𓀴I know it is through no effort of
 your own that you have acquired this
982𓀴undoubted beauty. When
 I reached Bellagio
 I saw there the most beautiful
983𓀴human being I have ever seen in my
 life (you need not jog your foot,
984𓀴Horace); she was a
 woman, and she was
 exquisitely beautiful. If you ask
985𓀴my aunt, she will
 tell you that a girl
 as beautiful as that ought to be
986𓀴immured for life behind
 walls. However,
 she wasn’t immured, she was
987𓀴walking along on the shores of the
 lake with a loathsome man I hated,
988𓀴and she had a mouth that made your
 heart ache to look at, with the mere
989𓀴maddening beauty
 of it! She was very
 tall, and everything about her was
990𓀴slender that ought
 to be slender--and
 every curve that ought to be full
991𓀴was full--and her head was poised
 like a flower, and her skin was soft
992𓀴as the tenderest little petal of
 a new bud, and colored like light
993𓀴through a cloud, and her eyes were
 dark and stormy like a black lake in
994𓀴the mountains--and
 unutterably sad.
 I could go on describing her all
995𓀴night, but you’ve got
 to go at half-past
 ten. The absurd part of the
996𓀴whole story is that
 she was in love
 with the silly little scrap one
997𓀴might call a man, I suppose, if we
 had to label him as a specimen, and
998𓀴he--was tired (if
 you please) of her!
 Plainly, Helen of Troy, the Venus
999𓀴of Milo--or whatever you choose to
 consider within a thousand miles of
1000𓀴her--no longer suited
 his convenience!
1001𓀴
1002𓀴“At this moment he
 caught diphtheria,
 and I sincerely hope he suffered
1003𓀴abominably; but, needless to say,
 he hadn’t the decency to die. No one
1004𓀴in the hotel was
 any the wiser. It
 was too early in the season, and the
1005𓀴man had money, so ‘Helen
 of Troy’ nursed
 him in their particular part of
1006𓀴the hotel behind
 a carbolic sheet,
 and we were told he had _bronchitis_.
1007𓀴
1008𓀴“My aunt is one
 of the most plucky
 and altogether delightful women I
1009𓀴know, but she has
 a pronounced terror
 of infectious disease, and if she
1010𓀴had guessed what lurked
 in that distant
 wing I might never be telling
1011𓀴you this story. One
 morning as I was
 crossing the hotel lounge I saw the
1012𓀴unpromising specimen
 of manhood in
 front of the bureau. He had quite
1013𓀴recovered and was
 giving notice for
 his departure that day. He added
1014𓀴that Madame could
 not accompany him;
 she had better be removed to the
1015𓀴hospital, as he was
 unable to continue
 to offer her his protection. I
1016𓀴heard him say this
 in the quick French,
 which he no doubt calculated
1017𓀴could hardly reach
 the intelligence
 of an English miss. Then I went over
1018𓀴to the bureau and
 told the manager
 that I would be responsible for
1019𓀴Madame, and that
 I would nurse her
 and undertake her expenses. He seemed
1020𓀴very unwilling to
 accept my offer,
 and finally under promise of secrecy
1021𓀴he told me the nature
 of the trouble.
 There was no one in the hotel but
1022𓀴ourselves. I told my
 aunt what I intended
 to do, and that as bronchitis
1023𓀴was occasionally
 infectious I should
 not come out of my patient’s room
1024𓀴for some weeks. (Did
 I ever tell you
 that I had worked previously in a
1025𓀴London hospital
 for a year? I meant
 to be a nurse, but my throat wasn’t
1026𓀴strong enough, so
 I never finished
 my training.) Well, my aunt appealed
1027𓀴to my common sense,
 to my affection
 for her, and finally to her
1028𓀴authority; and then I kissed her
 and reminded her that she had always
1029𓀴told me to consider
 my life my personal
 property, and how long Helen of
1030𓀴Troy’s eyelashes
 were, and what an
 ineffable brute the man must have
1031𓀴been. She said I was
 a suicidal idiot,
 and that I could send her a daily
1032𓀴message. But of
 course I never did,
 because you might be able to carry
1033𓀴that kind of bronchitis in notes.
1034𓀴
1035𓀴“Well, the end of
 the story was that
 my aunt met the doctor, and whether
1036𓀴she had had her suspicions or not
 before, I don’t know, but the doctor
1037𓀴couldn’t stand against
 her; she got
 the truth out of him, left the hotel
1038𓀴in a panic, and wired to me to
 leave instantly, get quarantined
1039𓀴somewhere, and then join her.
1040𓀴
1041𓀴“I had been by this
 time a fortnight
 with Helen of Troy; she was
1042𓀴recovering, but she had found out
 that I wasn’t the man, and her heart
1043𓀴was broken. I don’t
 expect you know
 anything about women with broken
1044𓀴hearts, Horace, but
 I think you would
 agree with me, you can’t leave
1045𓀴them. So I didn’t
 leave Helen of Troy.
 We stayed on together long after
1046𓀴she had actually
 recovered. I slept
 in a room leading out of hers, and I
1047𓀴was glad I was a strong
 woman, because
 on three occasions she tried to
1048𓀴commit suicide,
 and you need a good
 deal of muscle to stop a person who
1049𓀴wants to commit
 suicide as much as
 she did. After her illness was over
1050𓀴we used to wander up and down the
 garden by the lake-side. The season
1051𓀴had begun there, and all kinds of
 people kept turning up. One day some
1052𓀴strange men spoke
 to us in the garden.
 One of them was a friend of the
1053𓀴‘unpromising specimen,’
 and before
 we had time to make ourselves
1054𓀴perfectly plain to
 them the hotel gossip
 scuttled off like a rabbit from
1055𓀴almost under our
 feet to the manager,
 and he told us the next morning
1056𓀴very politely that unfortunately
 our rooms were wanted.
1057𓀴
1058𓀴“We left, of course, and Helen of
 Troy went back to America (did I tell
1059𓀴you she was half-Jewish
 and half-American?).
 She had a friend on the
1060𓀴stage who had offered her a part.
 She never told me her real name. I
1061𓀴always called her
 ‘Helen,’ and though
 she promised to write to me I have
1062𓀴never heard from
 her since. I expect
 she thought I might try to trace
1063𓀴her.
1064𓀴
1065𓀴“That is the whole
 and entire story
 of Helen of Troy, and I’m afraid, my
1066𓀴dear Horace, that
 you can no longer
 consider me the most sensible woman
1067𓀴in the world.”
1068𓀴
1069𓀴Horace took her hand
 in his and kissed it.
1070𓀴
1071𓀴“I wish I had married
 you ten years
 ago,” he said gently. Then he
1072𓀴remembered Annette.
 He let her hand
 drop suddenly, and walked quickly to
1073𓀴the window.
1074𓀴
1075𓀴“It’s half-past ten,” said Edith,
 and then she moved past him and ran
1076𓀴hastily upstairs, because she did
 not wish him to say good-night to her
1077𓀴while he was remembering Annette.
1078𓀴
1079𓀴Miss Lestrange’s comment on
 the story was characteristic.
1080𓀴
1081𓀴“Dear me, Horace!”
 she said. “What
 an extraordinary tale! How strange
1082𓀴those kind of people
 are! I suppose
 it never occurred to either the aunt
1083𓀴or the niece to hire a trained
 nurse for the creature?”
1084𓀴
1085𓀴And Horace hung his head, because
 there are some explanations which the
1086𓀴children of light
 are ashamed to put
 to the children of this world, who
1087𓀴are so much wiser.
1088𓀴
1089𓀴
1090𓀴                
                   V
1091𓀴
1092𓀴Miss Lestrange called
 the next day
 upon her future sister-in-law. She
1093𓀴took a chair with
 the resigned manner
 of a woman who will try to be as
1094𓀴comfortable as she can, and she
 talked to Edith with a detached but
1095𓀴patient cordiality.
1096𓀴
1097𓀴“Bayswater is such
 a charming part
 to live in,” she began. “I felt as I
1098𓀴came away from stuffy
 little Curzon
 Street quite as if I were on a
1099𓀴picnic or a summer
 excursion. It must
 be so nice to live here; I wonder
1100𓀴why nobody does?”
1101𓀴
1102𓀴Edith smiled pleasantly.
1103𓀴
1104𓀴“Oh, ‘nobody’ does,” she replied,
 pouring out tea; “and it’s only the
1105𓀴‘somebodies’ who don’t! You see,
 Miss Lestrange, you must pay the
1106𓀴penalty of greatness.”
1107𓀴
1108𓀴“Dear me--witty!” thought
 Miss Lestrange,
 and she used the word with as
1109𓀴much disapproval as if she meant
 “wild.” Aloud she merely murmured
1110𓀴something irrelevant
 about Kensington
 Gardens. It was one of Miss
1111𓀴Lestrange’s great
 social gifts that
 she could allow an awkward silence
1112𓀴to take place without any of the
 awkwardness adhering to herself. She
1113𓀴would sit staring through
 a tortoiseshell
 _lorgnette_ with an air which
1114𓀴plainly said:
1115𓀴
1116𓀴“This silence is
 nothing to me; I can
 break it whenever I choose--only I
1117𓀴don’t choose.”
1118𓀴
1119𓀴Unfortunately, Edith
 had the tea-things,
 which did almost as well.
1120𓀴
1121𓀴“I think the Lindleys
 knew your aunt,”
 said Miss Lestrange at last. “It
1122𓀴is so pleasant, is it not, to
 discover a mutual acquaintance?”
1123𓀴
1124𓀴“Very,” said Edith.
 “It’s almost as
 exciting as making a new relation.
1125𓀴Do you take sugar?”
1126𓀴
1127𓀴“One lump, please.
 I was delighted
 to hear of my brother’s impending
1128𓀴marriage,” continued
 Miss Lestrange;
 “delighted. Of course, I had been
1129𓀴expecting it for
 some time. I have
 but little faith in inveterate
1130𓀴bachelors, and none
 at all in inveterate
 widowers. Besides, a sensible
1131𓀴marriage for a man
 of my brother’s
 age is very desirable. He settles
1132𓀴down, the phase
 of romance is over,
 and the phase of domesticity sets
1133𓀴in; and, of course, it is always
 a relief when one knows for certain
1134𓀴that one’s brother won’t
 marry a barmaid.”
1135𓀴
1136𓀴“I can’t fancy Horace marrying a
 barmaid at any time,” said Edith,
1137𓀴smiling.
1138𓀴
1139𓀴“When you are my
 age, my dear, you
 will no doubt live to see, as I have
1140𓀴seen, all the things you cannot
 imagine taking place,” said Miss
1141𓀴Lestrange, putting
 down her tea, which
 she had not finished, as if she
1142𓀴did not like it.
1143𓀴
1144𓀴There had been things
 in their conversation
 which had not pleased her,
1145𓀴but this last hit
 had told (if you
 go on hitting long enough, some hit
1146𓀴generally does). She had expected
 to find Miss Walton good-looking and
1147𓀴good-humored; she
 had not expected
 to find her unembarrassed and
1148𓀴well-armed. However,
 Miss Lestrange
 always dealt with the unexpected as
1149𓀴if it was perfectly ordinary, so
 that no one ever discovered her
1150𓀴mistakes.
1151𓀴
1152𓀴“I believe you are
 to be introduced
 shortly to your step-son!” Miss
1153𓀴Lestrange began reflectively.
 “I hope
 you will take to the poor child.”
1154𓀴
1155𓀴“I always love children,”
 said Edith gently.
1156𓀴
1157𓀴“Ah!” said Miss
 Lestrange, “that is
 a refreshing change from the modern
1158𓀴note. Annette’s child, however--I
 refer to my brother’s former wife--is
1159𓀴peculiar. Annette
 was highly sensitive,
 like a spring blossom, and her
1160𓀴son takes after her.
 I shall be delighted
 to help you in any way I can
1161𓀴upon the subject.”
1162𓀴
1163𓀴Edith said:
1164𓀴
1165𓀴“He is coming at five o’clock; I
 hope very much he won’t dislike me.”
1166𓀴
1167𓀴“My dear, why should
 he?” said Miss
 Lestrange, rising to her feet and
1168𓀴holding out her hand. “He is not
 old enough to remember his mother,
1169𓀴fortunately--I mean,
 of course, there
 will be no soreness of comparison
1170𓀴as there might be
 with an older child.
 We will meet again soon, shall we
1171𓀴not? Good-bye.”
1172𓀴
1173𓀴Edith suddenly found
 that she could
 say nothing more; a slow paralysis
1174𓀴of icy cold seemed
 to be numbing her
 limbs and brain. She could find no
1175𓀴more words; this woman--pleasant,
 courteous, heartless--seemed to have
1176𓀴pelted her to death
 with innumerable
 hailstones. She stood breathless
1177𓀴and quivering in the doorway,
 and there Lady Walton found her.
1178𓀴
1179𓀴“My dear!” she said quickly.
 “What is the matter?”
1180𓀴
1181𓀴Edith began to laugh.
1182𓀴
1183𓀴“Horace’s sister is a very clever
 woman, auntie,” she said. “Now, if I
1184𓀴were a man I would swear loud and
 long, and then go and take a sherry
1185𓀴cobbler or a gin
 sling, or whatever
 is the strongest American drink, to
1186𓀴give me fresh courage
 to meet my small
 step-son, for I believe she came
1187𓀴just now simply to
 unnerve me for the
 ordeal, for I have a feeling as if
1188𓀴there were worse to follow. She
 spoke of Horace throughout as ‘my
1189𓀴brother,’ in a tone which gave me
 fully to understand that he would
1190𓀴always be far more extensively
 her brother than my husband.”
1191𓀴
1192𓀴Lady Walton looked
 at her carefully.
1193𓀴
1194𓀴“Go and take a cup of tea,” she
 said; “your nerves are shaken, but
1195𓀴depend upon it, child, you didn’t
 collapse when she was there. I should
1196𓀴have received her with you, only
 I did not like her to think that you
1197𓀴needed to call up
 your reserves. Let
 us hope the men of the family are
1198𓀴less alpine. I shall
 be out till dinner.”
1199𓀴
1200𓀴Lady Walton kissed
 her niece; she was
 very fond of her, rather sorry for
1201𓀴her, and extremely proud of her.
 On the whole she considered Edith
1202𓀴over-sensitive; she would have
 dearly enjoyed a tussle with Miss
1203𓀴Lestrange herself, but Edith was
 too tender-hearted for prolonged
1204𓀴warfare. She could
 take the defensive,
 but she couldn’t hit back. Lady
1205𓀴Walton knew this, and it annoyed
 her; in her heart of hearts she was
1206𓀴rather cruel, and
 she despised people
 who could not be a little cruel
1207𓀴too. Still, Edith was undeniably
 plucky, so she patted her cheek and
1208𓀴went out cheerfully for a drive.
1209𓀴
1210𓀴Half an hour later,
 with eager palpitating
 heart Edith gazed out of the
1211𓀴window at a pair
 of figures coming
 up the steps. Horace was leading a
1212𓀴small curly-headed
 boy, to whom he
 was talking nervously in that tone of
1213𓀴eager and would-be cheerfulness
 in which parents seek to ingratiate
1214𓀴themselves in order to overcome
 the inflexible judgment of a child.
1215𓀴Leslie said nothing; he was using
 enormous self-control, but it did not
1216𓀴reach to speech. That morning his
 beloved tutor had been spirited
1217𓀴away--a whim of
 this new invisible
 monster. Who knew how soon his Aunt
1218𓀴Etta, or even his
 father himself, would
 follow, and he (Leslie) would be
1219𓀴left without protection
 or assistance,
 face to face with the
1220𓀴unendurable? His
 father’s words fell
 upon his ears like the well-meaning
1221𓀴patter of a nursery
 rhyme. Talking
 made no difference; it could not
1222𓀴cover up the fact that they were
 going to see Her, and that she
1223𓀴lived--this crushing
 monster of iniquity--in
 this very house whose stiff
1224𓀴and odious steps they
 were now climbing.
 There were flower-boxes in the
1225𓀴windows full of pink
 geraniums. Leslie
 was very fond of flower-boxes. He
1226𓀴was an imaginative little boy,
 and he said fiercely to himself:
1227𓀴
1228𓀴“They are not really
 flower-boxes,
 they are pretend boxes, put there
1229𓀴like wicked witches
 pretend to put
 things in fairy tales to take you
1230𓀴in.”
1231𓀴
1232𓀴Horace cleared his throat.
1233𓀴
1234𓀴“You will try to be nice to her,
 won’t you, my boy, for your old
1235𓀴father’s sake?”
 he asked as he rang
 the bell. This was a mistake; he
1236𓀴should have let Leslie
 ring the bell.
 Aunt Etta always did. Leslie said
1237𓀴so in a tone of
 ruffled uneasiness.
 His father apologized but repeated
1238𓀴his question.
1239𓀴
1240𓀴“Oh, yes, I shall
 be polite!” said
 Leslie. “Aunt Etta said Lestranges
1241𓀴are always polite.”
1242𓀴
1243𓀴“Well, I hope you’ll
 be kind too,”
 said his father. Leslie said nothing;
1244𓀴he had not been told
 that Lestranges
 are always kind--besides, he was
1245𓀴examining the carpet. It was nice
 and thick, and he thought there were
1246𓀴birds on it, but
 they were not going
 slowly enough to make sure. A door
1247𓀴opened, and in a
 bower of late spring
 flowers stood a woman--a tall,
1248𓀴dark woman with lips that laughed
 and eyes that swam in tears, and
1249𓀴outstretched hands
 and a low, sweet
 voice like music--saying his name
1250𓀴very quickly and
 paying no attention
 to his father at all.
1251𓀴
1252𓀴Leslie stopped perfectly
 still and
 looked at her. There was no doubt
1253𓀴about it, she was worse
 than a witch--she
 was an enchantress! He knew no
1254𓀴spell to change her
 back into a snake
 or a pig. He could only stand and
1255𓀴look at her with grave
 and disapproving
 eyes, and then hold out his
1256𓀴little slender hand
 with the stately
 politeness of a well-mannered
1257𓀴child--the severest
 rebuke in Nature.
1258𓀴
1259𓀴“How do you do?” he said gravely;
 then he looked round for his father.
1260𓀴His father was gone.
 For a moment he
 had a wild thought of darting after
1261𓀴him, of screaming
 for help and flying
 down those soft, broad covered
1262𓀴passages. Horror
 shook his quivering
 nerves, but pride restrained him.
1263𓀴His father had deserted
 him. Perhaps
 she had the power to make his
1264𓀴father invisible.
 At any rate, she
 should not make a Lestrange a coward,
1265𓀴so he sat down politely
 and looked at her.
1266𓀴
1267𓀴“I hope you will
 like these little
 cakes I have got for your tea,” said
1268𓀴Edith, and her hand
 shook a little.
 “They are all in the shape of
1269𓀴fishes. I have a very nice cook,
 and she made them for me, and we put
1270𓀴eyes in--and everything.”
1271𓀴
1272𓀴“It was very kind of you,” said
 Leslie, “but I would rather not eat
1273𓀴them.”
1274𓀴
1275𓀴“But you will have
 some tea, won’t
 you?” she pleaded; “and all these
1276𓀴buns have got hundreds
 and thousands
 on them, and they are buttered.”
1277𓀴
1278𓀴There was no doubt about it,
 she knew how to put things, this
1279𓀴enchantress; the hundreds and
 thousands were a distinct point.
1280𓀴
1281𓀴“Thank you, I had my tea before
 I came,” said Leslie. “I won’t take
1282𓀴anything to eat--at
 least I’d rather not.”
1283𓀴
1284𓀴“Oh, I don’t want
 you to do anything
 you’d rather not!” cried Edith
1285𓀴quickly. “I want you to be happy;
 don’t you think--don’t you think,
1286𓀴Leslie, we might be friends?”
1287𓀴
1288𓀴Leslie eyed her fixedly.
 She had not
 laughed at him, nor asked how old
1289𓀴he was, nor offered
 to kiss him; she
 had done nothing really wrong, and
1290𓀴there was something
 quite friendly
 and shining in her eyes--probably
1291𓀴magic--but certainly shining.
1292𓀴
1293𓀴“I don’t think it’s possible,”
 said Leslie slowly. Then he added
1294𓀴politely:
1295𓀴
1296𓀴“Shall we talk of
 something else?”
1297𓀴
1298𓀴Edith went to the
 window. Her eyes
 did not shine so much when she came
1299𓀴back--perhaps his courage
 and self-command
 were overcoming the magic. It
1300𓀴seemed like it, for her voice was
 not so gay. To begin with, it had
1301𓀴sounded very gay,
 as if she would like
 to dance and play games. This was
1302𓀴probably what she had done with
 father. She had bewitched him
1303𓀴completely. Mr. Flinders
 had said so.
1304𓀴
1305𓀴“Your father told
 me, Leslie,” said
 Edith when she returned from the
1306𓀴window, “that you were very fond
 of soldiers. I, too, am very fond of
1307𓀴soldiers, so I thought
 perhaps you
 would like to see some I bought this
1308𓀴morning--they are two
 cavalry regiments;
 both the generals have cocked
1309𓀴hats and swords.”
1310𓀴
1311𓀴“Are there guns?” asked Leslie
 with forgetful rapture.
1312𓀴
1313𓀴“Yes, there are guns
 and gun-carriages.
 Shall I clear this table? There,
1314𓀴you know how to fasten them on
 perhaps! Will you show me how?”
1315𓀴
1316𓀴Leslie regained his knowledge
 of the situation.
1317𓀴
1318𓀴“They are very easy
 to put on,” he
 said. “You run them along like this.
1319𓀴Are they imitation,
 or can they go off?”
1320𓀴
1321𓀴“They can go off with
 peas,” said Edith kindly.
1322𓀴
1323𓀴Leslie’s face flushed--real guns
 that could go off with peas were
1324𓀴excellent and sane
 amusements even
 for an enchantress. By-and-by he
1325𓀴forgot her profession, and began
 to order her about. They played
1326𓀴contentedly for an hour, then the
 clock struck six. Leslie counted it.
1327𓀴“Shortly after six,
 my poor dear boy,
 they will let you come home,” his
1328𓀴Aunt Etta had said.
 He put down the
 general and pushed the table away;
1329𓀴his lips quivered.
1330𓀴
1331𓀴“You’re--you’re almost nice,” he
 said. “I wonder you can break up a
1332𓀴home.”
1333𓀴
1334𓀴“Oh, my dear, my
 dear!” cried Edith,
 but she did not offer to touch him;
1335𓀴she only turned shining
 and appealing
 eyes to him. Her eyes were too
1336𓀴much; they should not have been
 so kind when she was so wicked.
1337𓀴
1338𓀴“I shall never see the soldiers
 again,” he said mournfully.
1339𓀴
1340𓀴“But, Leslie, they are yours; I
 bought them for you,” she pleaded
1341𓀴“Indeed, indeed, I bought
 them for you this morning.”
1342𓀴
1343𓀴“Lestranges don’t
 take bribes,” said
 Leslie coldly; still he looked at
1344𓀴the general and the best
 gun--it was a very good gun.
1345𓀴
1346𓀴“But it isn’t a bribe,” explained
 the enchantress. “Won’t you even take
1347𓀴the general and the gun--”
1348𓀴
1349𓀴Leslie’s chest heaved. He looked
 across the table at her.
1350𓀴
1351𓀴“Will you give up my father?” he
 asked. “If you’ll give him up I’ll
1352𓀴take--I’ll take both the
 general and the gun.”
1353𓀴
1354𓀴“Oh, but, Leslie,
 I couldn’t--he’d
 be so unhappy--”
1355𓀴
1356𓀴“No, he wouldn’t,”
 said Leslie firmly.
 “He’d get used to it in time;
1357𓀴there are lots of
 things he has--me
 and Aunt Etta, and a new cuckoo
1358𓀴clock I gave him for
 his last birthday.
 Oh, give him up--give him up--!”
1359𓀴
1360𓀴The tears came suddenly now; all
 the controlled terrors, the pent-up
1361𓀴agony, the puzzled situation, the
 fearful prospects, rushed to the top
1362𓀴of the child’s mind: it was like
 the over-filling of a cup. He flung
1363𓀴himself face downwards
 on the sofa,
 dragging the tablecloth after him
1364𓀴and covering the
 carpet with defeated
 soldiers. Edith knelt beside him
1365𓀴trying to soothe and comfort him,
 but his little clenched hands pushed
1366𓀴her away. The general
 with his cocked
 hat and the best gun lay on her
1367𓀴lap, and bitter tears
 fell on them--bitter,
 unavailing tears; and so
1368𓀴Horace found them
 shortly after six.
1369𓀴
1370𓀴He carried his sobbing little boy
 away, and Edith sat and wept over the
1371𓀴soldiers alone and uncomforted.
1372𓀴
1373𓀴“I wonder how she
 can have managed
 to upset him so,” said Etta; “but I
1374𓀴thought this afternoon
 that she hardly
 looked as if she could manage a
1375𓀴delicate highly-strung child. She
 has sent him into a really dangerous
1376𓀴fit of crying.”
1377𓀴
1378𓀴As for Horace, he
 went to his study
 and smoked a strong cigar. He was
1379𓀴puzzled and disappointed.
 Edith had
 been so certain she could win the
1380𓀴little chap over,
 and the boy hadn’t
 cried while he was there. Edith
1381𓀴must have done something
 stupid; she
 had been upset enough herself, poor
1382𓀴girl; but he did not go back and
 comfort her--she must have done
1383𓀴something stupid.
1384𓀴

                   VI
1387𓀴
1388𓀴“It all depends
 upon what you mean
 by a successful marriage,” Lady
1389𓀴Walton had remarked
 earlier in the
 day. “You have now, my dear Edith,
1390𓀴been married ten years; you look
 ten years younger than you are; your
1391𓀴husband spends all
 his evenings at
 home, and you have an excellent staff
1392𓀴of servants. I really do not
 see what more you can ask!”
1393𓀴
1394𓀴“I don’t suppose we
 often see why other
 people should ask more than they
1395𓀴have,” Edith replied.
 “Other people
 ought to be satisfied, and yet other
1396𓀴people aren’t.”
1397𓀴
1398𓀴“I don’t wish to
 talk metaphysics,”
 said Lady Walton; “it reminds me of
1399𓀴the time when I fell downstairs
 on the back of my head and had
1400𓀴concussion of the
 brain. I suppose
 you mean you haven’t any children?
1401𓀴Neither had I, and I have
 never regretted it.”
1402𓀴
1403𓀴Lady Walton was
 one of those people
 who always thought that what she did
1404𓀴not object to was
 not objectionable;
 she felt this very strongly.
1405𓀴
1406𓀴“My own faults,
 which I can excuse
 quite easily and always see reasons
1407𓀴for,” she went on after a pause,
 “would annoy me excessively in a
1408𓀴younger generation--even
 my virtues
 would seem weak and tame imitation
1409𓀴in some pudding-faced young girl.
 I should have known better what to do
1410𓀴with a boy who would have been
 certain to die if he had been
1411𓀴satisfactory, and equally certain
 to live if he was not. No, my dear
1412𓀴Edith, let us be thankful we have
 both been spared a tiresome and
1413𓀴difficult vocation.
 An unhappy marriage
 is often made bearable by such
1414𓀴additions, but a really happy
 marriage can dispense with them.”
1415𓀴
1416𓀴“Oh, a really happy marriage!”
 Edith had murmured.
1417𓀴
1418𓀴“My dear,” her aunt had replied
 briskly, “you are one of those
1419𓀴unfortunate people
 who ask too much,
 and do not take steps to get it.
1420𓀴You should do one
 or the other. What
 your husband needs is something to
1421𓀴shake him. It is a pity you are
 not a delicate woman; you might try
1422𓀴nerves. I suppose
 you are too high
 and mighty to stoop to flirtation.”
1423𓀴
1424𓀴“I should do it so badly,” said
 Edith, laughing, “and besides I’m
1425𓀴forty.”
1426𓀴
1427𓀴“You have such a
 tiresome habit of
 remembering your own age,” her aunt
1428𓀴replied; “it even
 makes me remember
 mine. I will take a nap.”
1429𓀴
1430𓀴Edith had left her and gone home.
 It was something, she reflected, to
1431𓀴have a home, and--every one would
 have agreed--such a comfortable home.
1432𓀴
1433𓀴She had had a difficult
 life these
 past ten years; she had not only to
1434𓀴make her husband happy which had
 been her unswerving purpose from the
1435𓀴first, but she had
 had to watch her
 failure, and accept the lower level
1436𓀴of opportunity allowed
 to her--and
 make him contented; she had, at
1437𓀴least, done this.
1438𓀴
1439𓀴Miss Lestrange had
 taken Leslie slowly
 and vaguely away; there was still
1440𓀴a talk of his return
 home--there would
 always be a talk of it. Meanwhile
1441𓀴the boy, his aunt,
 and an excellent
 tutor (almost as amenable as Mr.
1442𓀴Flinders) divided
 their time between
 Mallows and Brighton. The boy had
1443𓀴been definitely delicate;
 a determined
 effort to send him to Harrow
1444𓀴failed, and he was
 taken away once
 more by his aunt and tutor. Oxford
1445𓀴remained; he was now quite strong
 enough for Oxford. Still Miss
1446𓀴Lestrange held him back; she
 could not follow him to Oxford.
1447𓀴
1448𓀴From time to time he
 visited his father.
 The tie between them had never
1449𓀴ceased to be strong;
 but for Edith
 there had never been a second chance.
1450𓀴The boy was beautiful
 as his mother
 had been, and suspicious with all
1451𓀴the hard, cramping suspicion of
 a weak nature. Edith’s unvarying
1452𓀴sweetness and companionableness
 roused
 a sharp antagonism in him; she
1453𓀴was “trying to get round him,” as
 his aunt had said. He fought Edith
1454𓀴because he could
 so easily have loved
 her; he pushed her away from him
1455𓀴because he wanted to confide in
 her. He treated her with a studied
1456𓀴polite insolence which
 made her dumb before him.
1457𓀴
1458𓀴Horace Lestrange
 looked from one to
 the other wistfully; something was
1459𓀴wrong. Etta said it
 was Edith’s fault,
 and Edith said nothing, and the
1460𓀴boy said nothing; so it ended in
 Horace saying nothing too. He merely
1461𓀴went down by himself
 for week-ends
 to Mallows, and felt that his
1462𓀴marriage had been, not a failure
 exactly, but not very definitely a
1463𓀴success.
1464𓀴
1465𓀴He had indeed frequently
 felt tenderness
 for his wife, and he always
1466𓀴felt friendship. She was his most
 delightful fireside and holiday
1467𓀴companion; they read
 the same books,
 laughed at the same things; but
1468𓀴they hardly lived
 the same life. He
 missed his boy with a kind of dull
1469𓀴ache that would
 have been difficult
 to fathom; and if it wasn’t Edith’s
1470𓀴fault--well--it wouldn’t
 have happened
 if it hadn’t been for her. Edith
1471𓀴stood with her hand
 on the mantelpiece
 gazing into the study fire; on
1472𓀴one side of it sat
 her husband, glancing
 through the evening paper; and,
1473𓀴on the other, the
 boy on one of his
 occasional visits (lately they had
1474𓀴been much more frequent) to his
 London home. He was half-smoking
1475𓀴cigarette after cigarette, and as
 Edith turned her attention to him she
1476𓀴was struck afresh
 by the expression
 in his eyes. It was the tyrannical
1477𓀴selfish face of
 a pleasure-seeker.
 She compared it, with a sharp pang of
1478𓀴disappointment,
 to the controlled,
 honest manliness of her husband’s
1479𓀴expression. Couldn’t
 they have made
 his boy more like him--have put
1480𓀴something better than
 hungry discontent
 into Leslie’s beautiful eyes?
1481𓀴
1482𓀴“I’m going out,” said
 the boy suddenly.
1483𓀴
1484𓀴His father looked
 up from his paper
 with evident disappointment.
1485𓀴
1486𓀴“I thought Esdaile was coming
 in for bridge?” he said quickly.
1487𓀴
1488𓀴“I think, if you
 will excuse me, I’ll
 go out,” his son repeated, with a
1489𓀴politeness which did not conceal
 his evident intention.
1490𓀴
1491𓀴His father eyed him curiously
 for a moment, then he said:
1492𓀴
1493𓀴“Musical comedy?”
1494𓀴
1495𓀴The boy flushed scarlet.
1496𓀴
1497𓀴“Do you wish to know
 where I am going,
 sir?” he asked with angry irony.
1498𓀴
1499𓀴Edith interposed quickly.
1500𓀴
1501𓀴“If you are going,
 Leslie,” she said,
 “would you mind telephoning for
1502𓀴me, to Esdaile, not to come? It’s
 no use his coming if we aren’t going
1503𓀴to play bridge.”
1504𓀴
1505𓀴Leslie never willingly
 looked at Edith;
 he did not do so now. He merely
1506𓀴raised his eyebrows, because he
 was annoyed at being asked to do
1507𓀴anything for anybody
 else, and replied:
1508𓀴
1509𓀴“Most certainly, if you wish it.”
1510𓀴
1511𓀴His father returned
 to the newspaper;
 the boy stalked in a turmoil of
1512𓀴offence and pricked
 conscience out
 of the room. If you want to be very
1513𓀴angry, people who attempt to meet
 you with patience and kindness are
1514𓀴mere fuel for the flame. Leslie
 had broken up a bridge four; he was
1515𓀴going to do something
 wrong; and nobody
 told him not to, or attempted to
1516𓀴interfere with him in any way.
 It was all extremely tiresome.
1517𓀴
1518𓀴The two left together exchanged
 a long look of sympathy and
1519𓀴understanding.
1520𓀴
1521𓀴“He’s very young,”
 said Edith softly.
 “That’s all, Horace--only very
1522𓀴young.”
1523𓀴
1524𓀴“He’s confoundedly
 cool,” said his
 father gloomily, “spoiling a bridge
1525𓀴four like that, and
 got up specially
 because he said he wanted it! It’s
1526𓀴so deuced difficult to know what
 the fellow does want nowadays.”
1527𓀴
1528𓀴“What made him blush
 like that, Horace,
 when you said ‘musical comedy’?”
1529𓀴said his wife, sitting opposite
 him, and holding up a fire-screen
1530𓀴between her face and the fire.
1531𓀴
1532𓀴“Oh, it’s some nonsense
 Etta’s been
 writing me; she thinks he comes up
1533𓀴here to meet a woman.
 No doubt he’s
 got some queer boy adoration in his
1534𓀴head, but it can’t be anything
 serious at his age.”
1535𓀴
1536𓀴“Is it a--what kind of
 a woman?” asked his wife.
1537𓀴
1538𓀴“Oh, some wonderful
 American beauty,
 old enough to be his mother--the
1539𓀴star of some touring
 company. It seems
 she has turned the heads of all
1540𓀴the London youths
 together. I told
 Etta she’d far better leave the
1541𓀴matter alone. It isn’t as if the
 boy’s prospects were dazzling; he’ll
1542𓀴have plenty, of course, in time,
 but he’s got nothing now but his
1543𓀴mother’s money, and this person
 isn’t likely to marry him for five
1544𓀴hundred a year. In
 three years’ time,
 well--he’ll have forgotten her
1545𓀴name.”
1546𓀴
1547𓀴“But--but her influence mightn’t
 be good?” Edith persisted.
1548𓀴
1549𓀴“I don’t know,” said
 Horace reflectively.
 “Some of her type are quite
1550𓀴unscrupulous, no
 doubt, but not all
 of them. Anyhow, I did do something;
1551𓀴I sent her a note,
 just giving the
 facts of the boy’s expectations quite
1552𓀴plainly, and asking her what she
 meant to do about it. I might have
1553𓀴called to see her--Etta
 wanted me to--but
 I didn’t see the good. Musical
1554𓀴comedy ladies are
 not in my line.”
1555𓀴
1556𓀴“And you didn’t tell me, Horace?”
1557𓀴
1558𓀴Edith lifted the fire-screen
 a little;
 he could not see her face; in her
1559𓀴voice there was a
 touch of reproach,
 not more--the friendly reproach of
1560𓀴a comrade who has been left
 out of a consultation.
1561𓀴
1562𓀴“No. I don’t know
 why I told you now,
 but it seemed natural somehow when
1563𓀴you asked.”
1564𓀴
1565𓀴“I am glad it seemed natural,”
 said Edith quietly.
1566𓀴
1567𓀴In most married
 lives there is one
 who understands, and one who is
1568𓀴content to be understood.
 Edith read
 her husband’s mind as if it were a
1569𓀴well-known book. She
 knew his motives,
 his honest scruples, his studious
1570𓀴chivalry, his quiet
 reticence. She
 knew when he suffered because the
1571𓀴marks of it were
 on her own heart;
 she knew when he was contented,
1572𓀴puzzled, worried, or pleased; and
 he knew nothing whatever about her,
1573𓀴except that she was always sweet
 to him, and only occasionally (as we
1574𓀴are told all women
 are) unreasonable.
 That he was sitting opposite a
1575𓀴woman now whose heart
 was very nearly
 broken, who had fed in secret on
1576𓀴sharp misery and
 long, ineffectual
 pain, had never even dimly touched
1577𓀴his imagination.
1578𓀴
1579𓀴Lady Walton had
 supposed that Edith
 might have a difficult time, but
1580𓀴that the quiet routine of married
 life would soon stifle the unnatural
1581𓀴hunger of her heart.
 Nothing had been
 stifled except expression. Edith
1582𓀴had thrust her own
 pain out of sight
 with strong hands; she had shut
1583𓀴love and anguish
 out of her eyes--she
 had schooled her lips not to
1584𓀴quiver and held her
 voice steady against
 the invasions of emotion; she
1585𓀴had taken stones for
 bread, and received
 them with pleased acquiescence,
1586𓀴as if, after all, her preference
 had always been for stones.
1587𓀴
1588𓀴But when it came
 to Horace’s pain,
 to the unstilled longing of his
1589𓀴heart, which she
 could have stilled;
 to the silent, patient endurance,
1590𓀴which she could have stirred into
 something resembling passionate joy;
1591𓀴then her life rose
 up against her,
 and the bitter waters of intense and
1592𓀴heavy anguish passed
 over her soul.
 Ah, the sickening pressure of those
1593𓀴hours! While he lay
 beside her sleeping
 quietly, she clenched her hands,
1594𓀴and quivered with
 the sobs she dared
 not free. And then with haggard
1595𓀴eyes she watched
 the slow day dawn
 over London, the day which would
1596𓀴be--as all other days to her--the
 resetting of her life to sober pain.
1597𓀴He thought her a sensible,
 level-headed,
 unemotional woman, and she was
1598𓀴a creature born
 of flame and tears!
1599𓀴
1600𓀴The hand that held
 the fire-screen
 shook a little.
1601𓀴
1602𓀴“You mustn’t let
 yourself worry about
 it,” said Horace kindly, “or I
1603𓀴shall be sorry I’ve
 told you. Honestly,
 I don’t think it will become a
1604𓀴serious matter.
 There’s the evening
 post. I rather imagine that
1605𓀴extremely fancy envelope
 may be from
 the lady herself. My correspondents
1606𓀴are usually less stimulating
 in their notepaper.”
1607𓀴
1608𓀴He read it, frowned in a puzzled
 way, and tossed it over to Edith. It
1609𓀴ran:
1610𓀴
1611𓀴    MY DEAR SIR,--Thank you for
 your simple, explicit statement of
1612𓀴    the case. You gave me a great
 deal of amusement, and no pain. I
1613𓀴    wish your son had copied your
 style. I daresay he has told you
1614𓀴    that he meant to marry me;
 but though an imaginative child, I
1615𓀴    don’t suppose
 he can ever have
 said to you that I meant to marry
1616𓀴    him. I don’t make promises,
 and unless any unforeseen
1617𓀴    circumstance should arise,
 I am not likely to undertake the
1618𓀴    experiment. As to my moral
 influence (which I notice you have
1619𓀴    done me the honor
 not to mention),
 I have always made it my
1620𓀴    invariable rule to leave boys
 alone. I laugh at them, but I do
1621𓀴    not hurt them.
1622𓀴
1623𓀴                             
                 Yours sincerely,
1624𓀴                                
                  ANASTASIA FALAISE.
1625𓀴
1626𓀴“Well, what do you make of that,
 my dear?” said Horace Lestrange,
1627𓀴feeling after his matches. “Seems
 to let us out, doesn’t it?”
1628𓀴
1629𓀴Edith let the paper fall into
 her lap and looked into the fire.
1630𓀴
1631𓀴“Poor woman!” she
 said very gently.
 “Do you know, Horace, she reminds me
1632𓀴just a little of
 Helen of Troy. Helen
 used to talk like that, as if the
1633𓀴soul had been eaten
 out of her words.
 I think a woman must be very
1634𓀴unhappy to write like that.”
1635𓀴
1636𓀴“It is time you
 went to bed, Edith;
 you look tired,” said her husband.
1637𓀴“Just throw that letter
 on the fire, will you?”
1638𓀴
1639𓀴She threw the letter on to
 the fire and watched it burn.
1640𓀴
1641𓀴“Poor woman!” she whispered
 to herself again. “Poor woman!”
1642𓀴
1643𓀴Horace got up and opened the door
 for her. He was very much relieved,
1644𓀴but he felt a pang of compunction
 at the same time. He had been a fool
1645𓀴to tell Edith; it seemed to upset
 her; the facts of life--love’s
1646𓀴tragedies--ought to be kept from
 good women. Then he went back to his
1647𓀴paper.
1648𓀴
1649𓀴
1650𓀴                
                  VII
1651𓀴
1652𓀴Like many people who believe in
 an over-ruling Providence, Miss
1653𓀴Lestrange never left anything to
 it. On the contrary, when her plans
1654𓀴succeeded, she remarked
 triumphantly
 that it was the will of heaven; and
1655𓀴when they failed,
 she said nothing
 about it, and tried again. It is
1656𓀴usually supposed that plans which
 play the part of Providence fail very
1657𓀴easily, but this
 is not really so;
 it is only the result of the plan
1658𓀴that fails--carefully
 combined arrangements
 made with due knowledge of
1659𓀴the forces of life
 seldom fail. What
 fails is what we expected to win
1660𓀴from such combinations.
 You plant,
 water, and gain your increase, and
1661𓀴what you thought were the golden
 apples of the Hesperides taste like
1662𓀴dust.
1663𓀴
1664𓀴This is what happened
 to Miss Lestrange.
 She gave a whole-hearted
1665𓀴devotion to Leslie;
 she kept him away
 from what she honestly believed to
1666𓀴be adverse influences; she cared
 for the delicate little boy until he
1667𓀴became as strong as the average
 youth; she made her home his home;
1668𓀴people always referred
 to him as “your dear boy.”
1669𓀴
1670𓀴This was the palace
 of her dreams,
 but the monarch had abdicated, and
1671𓀴the palace without its King
 is a Court in mourning.
1672𓀴
1673𓀴Leslie was vaguely
 dissatisfied; he
 had worshiped his Aunt Etta with an
1674𓀴ignorant devotion
 all his life; he
 had given her the love of a child and
1675𓀴the warm-hearted
 loyalty of a boy.
 Now he was grown up. He was nineteen,
1676𓀴and he would probably
 never be quite
 as old again--in any case, he would
1677𓀴never feel such
 unbroken confidence
 in his own judgment--and what did
1678𓀴his aunt appear? A small,
 faded, old-fashioned
 woman, who said “No” to
1679𓀴his wishes.
1680𓀴
1681𓀴There is a time
 in every boy’s life
 when he looks very narrowly at his
1682𓀴own parents; very often they are
 the barriers at the gates of his
1683𓀴imaginary Paradise,
 and he regards
 them as barriers; but if there is
1684𓀴solid stuff in the youth, the tie
 is strong enough to hold. His parents
1685𓀴are, of course, wrong,
 their opinions
 are worthless, their ideas are
1686𓀴effete and purely
 mirth-inspiring.
 But they are his parents. They are
1687𓀴people who love
 him with a strange
 love; they are ignorant people, but
1688𓀴he forgives them,
 and one day discovers
 that he himself belongs to this
1689𓀴inferior branch
 of humanity, and is
 giving his life up for his sons, who
1690𓀴regard him in his turn with
 affectionate depreciation.
1691𓀴
1692𓀴Leslie loved his
 father with a deep
 natural love, which time turned into
1693𓀴an irritated need. He had come to
 the conclusion that women were all
1694𓀴very well, but that
 feminine relations
 were a jealous bore, and
1695𓀴that--you must see life.
1696𓀴
1697𓀴So he saw life. Saw it immaturely
 and unwisely--or rather he may have
1698𓀴been said not to see it, but with
 the rush of youth’s music in his ears
1699𓀴he ran blindfold, and Life mocked
 him to her heart’s content, and gave
1700𓀴him pebbles for
 diamonds and dross
 for gold, till she blunted alike his
1701𓀴discrimination and his growth.
1702𓀴
1703𓀴Miss Lestrange stood by watching
 him with incompetent agony. She had
1704𓀴seen these things happen before
 to other people’s boys, and she had
1705𓀴always known why.
 The mothers were
 silly, the boys were unlicked
1706𓀴cubs--they had been spoilt from
 the first. Now she was not quite so
1707𓀴sure. Perhaps such
 things happened
 just out of misfortune, unhappiness,
1708𓀴blunders that must
 come, accidents
 of the type which are said to haunt
1709𓀴families who live according
 to the best regulations.
1710𓀴
1711𓀴Lines came into Miss
 Lestrange’s placid
 face, she lost sleep, appetite,
1712𓀴and repose. She woke
 with vague terrors,
 she was haunted by impotent
1713𓀴fears. There was
 nothing to be done,
 and she hadn’t the strength to do
1714𓀴nothing. Finally, the whole story
 focused on one notorious lady of
1715𓀴musical comedy.
 The youth of London
 gave her desperate homage and
1716𓀴adoration; she was
 old enough to be
 their mother; but they did not keep
1717𓀴these gifts for
 their mothers, they
 gave them to Anastasia Falaise, and
1718𓀴she accepted them
 with easy laughter.
1719𓀴
1720𓀴Miss Lestrange wrote
 to her brother,
 and her brother replied heartlessly
1721𓀴that it was “all right.”
1722𓀴
1723𓀴Leslie went on worshipping
 at this
 popular shrine; he was continually
1724𓀴absent from Mallows;
 if he was present
 he was silent when he wasn’t
1725𓀴irritable. He never
 mentioned the lady’s
 name, but he wrote to her every
1726𓀴day; she wrote to him sometimes,
 and vague ideas, resisted by common
1727𓀴sense, prompted Miss
 Lestrange to tamper
 with their correspondence. This
1728𓀴correspondence flourished
 even more
 conspicuously after the ineffective
1729𓀴efforts of Leslie’s
 father. It was
 evident to Miss Lestrange that there
1730𓀴was no help to be
 met in that quarter,
 so she attacked the citadel
1731𓀴itself. With nervous
 incoherence she
 implored Leslie to come abroad, to
1732𓀴give up this absurd
 infatuation. Leslie
 raised youth’s deadly standard
1733𓀴of silence. He blocked her
 utterance with a gloomy stare.
1734𓀴
1735𓀴Finally, he observed
 that he did not
 know what she meant, and left the
1736𓀴room. Young men and even old ones
 are to be congratulated on this gift
1737𓀴of absence; it is
 a very effective
 weapon. Leslie did not return for
1738𓀴some time; when he
 did, Miss Lestrange
 said nothing further on the
1739𓀴subject, for she had
 stayed in the room.
1740𓀴
1741𓀴Finally, goaded
 to desperation, she
 committed an unprecedented error.
1742𓀴She may, indeed,
 have been described
 as completely losing her head. She
1743𓀴went to call one
 day by appointment
 on Anastasia Falaise.
1744𓀴
1745𓀴Anastasia was staying in a famous
 London hotel. She had a charming
1746𓀴sitting-room; it
 was littered with
 presentations, and she sat shaded by
1747𓀴pink blinds with easy indolence
 in a large armchair.
1748𓀴
1749𓀴Miss Lestrange’s first impression
 may be given as it flashed into her
1750𓀴mind, “No woman of that type has
 any right to be so beautiful.”
1751𓀴Anastasia showed
 neither youth nor
 years in her face; she might as
1752𓀴easily have been thirty as fifty;
 she had no lines about her eyes and
1753𓀴mouth or marring her
 low Greek forehead.
 Her wide-set dark eyes looked
1754𓀴like some perennial
 mysterious spring
 of life. Her face and neck and
1755𓀴hands were the color
 of warm ivory;
 her black hair was natural, but as
1756𓀴nobody believed it,
 she would sometimes--to
 confirm it--let coil after
1757𓀴coil fall to her knees.
 She had beauty
 as some men have genius, and she
1758𓀴used it with more shrewdness and
 common sense than this other gift is
1759𓀴often used. She had no particular
 wish to please Miss Lestrange, so she
1760𓀴simply stared at her.
1761𓀴
1762𓀴Miss Lestrange was
 vaguely uncomfortable;
 she felt that she was with an
1763𓀴extraordinary person,
 and that she
 had lowered herself to the same level
1764𓀴by doing an extraordinary
 thing. This
 was the kind of woman she knew how
1765𓀴to snub; she did not know
 how to appeal to her.
1766𓀴
1767𓀴“I think you know
 my nephew, Leslie
 Lestrange,” she began, blushing a
1768𓀴little at her companion’s
 insolent, inanimate beauty.
1769𓀴
1770𓀴“There are half-a-dozen
 photographs
 of him, and the contents of several
1771𓀴jewelers’ shops,
 I should fancy, just
 behind you,” observed Anastasia.
1772𓀴“Have you come to
 retrieve them? I
 told him that unless his people were
1773𓀴whole-sale jewelers he had better
 try a less expensive amusement.”
1774𓀴
1775𓀴“His family is one of the oldest
 in England,” said Miss Lestrange
1776𓀴impressively.
1777𓀴
1778𓀴“Well, he’s young
 enough,” observed
 the imperturbable beauty. She had a
1779𓀴slight American intonation which
 Miss Lestrange found strangely
1780𓀴aggravating; it
 annoyed her almost
 beyond the power of speech.
1781𓀴
1782𓀴“I have always taken
 the greatest interest
 in my nephew’s concerns,” she
1783𓀴continued. “I have brought him up
 from his babyhood. I stand to him in
1784𓀴the place of his parents.”
1785𓀴
1786𓀴“And yet I had a
 very sensible letter
 from his father the other day,”
1787𓀴interrupted Anastasia,
 and she laughed
 a low velvety laugh of pure
1788𓀴pleasure (which Miss Lestrange
 promptly mistook for vulgar
1789𓀴impertinence). “I
 think it is the most
 sensible letter I ever had, and I
1790𓀴answered it. I guess he hasn’t
 sent you here, has he?”
1791𓀴
1792𓀴“My brother married regrettably
 a second time,” said Miss Lestrange
1793𓀴coldly, “a woman of
 no family connections,
 singularly unsuited to bring
1794𓀴up a delicate and
 sensitive child;
 even her husband has never pressed
1795𓀴the point.”
1796𓀴
1797𓀴“You don’t say,”
 observed Anastasia,
 narrowly regarding her exquisite
1798𓀴fingers. “Poor disconnected lady,
 I feel quite sorry for her!”
1799𓀴
1800𓀴“On the contrary,” replied
 Miss Lestrange,
 “she has, I think, been very
1801𓀴fortunate; a marriage of that
 kind for a girl in Edith Walton’s
1802𓀴position, and at her age--she was
 thirty at the time--does not happen
1803𓀴every day over here.”
1804𓀴
1805𓀴Anastasia suddenly
 woke up for the
 first time; she opened her great eyes
1806𓀴wide and looked
 at Miss Lestrange.
 It was a look so vital, so amazingly
1807𓀴keen, staring out of
 the soft, mysterious,
 velvety dullness, that Miss
1808𓀴Lestrange jumped.
1809𓀴
1810𓀴Then Anastasia sank back into her
 usual attitude of inspired indolence.
1811𓀴
1812𓀴“What did you say her name was?”
 she asked languidly. “Haddlestone? I
1813𓀴knew some people called
 that once--way out West.”
1814𓀴
1815𓀴“No, Walton,” repeated
 Miss Lestrange
 distinctly; “but it really hardly
1816𓀴matters what her
 name is, I think,
 to the subject under discussion.”
1817𓀴
1818𓀴“Were you discussing
 anything?” Anastasia
 asked calmly. “I wasn’t. I am
1819𓀴merely wasting my
 time. However, I
 won’t waste any more of it. What do
1820𓀴you want?” and her voice suddenly
 turned brisk and business-like.
1821𓀴
1822𓀴“I want you,” said Miss Lestrange
 with a sudden quiver of pathetic
1823𓀴middle-aged passion,
 “to let my boy
 go. You are a beautiful woman; what
1824𓀴does one boy more or less matter
 to you--a practically penniless boy,
1825𓀴too? Send him about his business,
 like a--like a kind-hearted woman.”
1826𓀴
1827𓀴“How do you know
 I am a kind-hearted
 woman?” Anastasia asked curiously.
1828𓀴
1829𓀴“Because,” said Miss
 Lestrange, rising
 to her feet, “you have all the
1830𓀴advantages on your side; you
 can easily afford to be.”
1831𓀴
1832𓀴“Well, I do call
 that cute!” drawled
 Anastasia. “That’s the best thing
1833𓀴you’ve said yet,
 only it’s not true.
 However, we needn’t go into that.
1834𓀴Now, Miss Lestrange, you’ve made
 a great mistake; if you had left the
1835𓀴matter in your brother’s
 hands you’d
 never have heard of it again--that
1836𓀴is to say, you wouldn’t seriously
 have heard of it. But, somehow or
1837𓀴other, you’ve put
 an idea into my head;
 well, that was a mistake. I have
1838𓀴very few ideas, and
 I always act upon
 them. I’m going to act right now;
1839𓀴but I don’t want an
 audience--so, good-by!”
1840𓀴
1841𓀴Anastasia rose too.
 She was head and
 shoulders above her companion, and
1842𓀴Miss Lestrange drew a long breath
 at the sight of her majestic swaying
1843𓀴figure. This was a woman to wreck
 kingdoms, and why should she bother
1844𓀴her head about a boy--a boy like
 Leslie, whose connections she didn’t
1845𓀴even know, whose disabilities she
 must, of course, see? It was all very
1846𓀴odd. The two women looked
 at each other for a moment.
1847𓀴
1848𓀴“I can’t understand you,” said
 Miss Lestrange at last, a little
1849𓀴helplessly, “and I don’t see that
 I can offer you anything you want in
1850𓀴exchange for what I ask.”
1851𓀴
1852𓀴“You can’t,” said
 Anastasia; “nobody
 can offer me what I want except
1853𓀴chocolates. Fortunately,
 I’m still
 very fond of chocolates. Well,
1854𓀴good-by, Miss Lestrange;
 I’m sorry
 I can’t oblige you, but I’ve got to
1855𓀴be amused, and I am going to
 amuse myself with your nephew.”
1856𓀴
1857𓀴“Oh, amuse yourself
 as much as you
 like,” murmured Miss Lestrange,
1858𓀴holding out her hand in farewell,
 “but don’t marry him!”
1859𓀴
1860𓀴“I guess you’re going
 to be disappointed,”
 observed Anastasia, as her
1861𓀴companion, reaching
 the door, turned
 to look back at her. “I guess
1862𓀴you’re going to feel
 disconnected, too!”
1863𓀴
1864𓀴Miss Lestrange didn’t
 know what her
 hostess meant, but she had said all
1865𓀴she had to say and
 done all she could
 do. There was nothing more to act
1866𓀴upon, and she knew
 that she had failed.
1867𓀴
1868𓀴Suddenly Miss Lestrange
 felt old and
 helpless; something that had always
1869𓀴accompanied her--a
 sense of the inherent
 dignity and interest of her
1870𓀴position--which made her observe
 the world blandly, as one who has a
1871𓀴right to a front seat
 on a grand-stand--left
 her. She felt as if she
1872𓀴was, after all, only
 one of the crowd,
 liable to be pushed and jogged by
1873𓀴elbows, even liable to be thrust
 permanently aside. She stood quite
1874𓀴still in the finely
 upholstered lounge
 of the big hotel, and a waiter
1875𓀴came up and asked her if
 he could bring her anything.
1876𓀴
1877𓀴“Yes,” said Miss
 Lestrange, sitting
 down at one of the many little
1878𓀴tables scattered about. “You may
 bring me a cup of tea. Perhaps,” she
1879𓀴said to herself, “that was what
 I wanted. I have missed my tea.”
1880𓀴
1881𓀴
1882𓀴                 
                 VIII
1883𓀴
1884𓀴Edith hardly turned
 her head to say
 “Come in!” to the timid knock at her
1885𓀴door. She was sitting
 at her desk,
 doing accounts, and puzzled as usual
1886𓀴by her immaculate predecessor’s
 example--an
 example which, “as the most
1887𓀴sensible of women,”
 she tried hard
 to follow, but she was frequently
1888𓀴overcome by the invincible malice
 of pounds, shillings, and pence.
1889𓀴
1890𓀴The pause, however,
 that followed arrested
 her attention, and she turned
1891𓀴to meet the eyes
 of her step-son with
 a thrill of astonishment. He had
1892𓀴never before voluntarily
 entered her
 private boudoir, and there was an
1893𓀴air about his whole person which
 betokened the unusual, though he
1894𓀴suppressed what he
 could only consider
 a weakness as well as he could.
1895𓀴
1896𓀴Edith saw in a moment
 that she must
 suppress it too. “I’m so glad you
1897𓀴have come,” she
 said; “now you can
 do this horrid sum for me. I am
1898𓀴trying to balance
 my accounts, and
 though I can see quite plainly what
1899𓀴I’ve spent and what
 I had to spend,
 they obstinately refuse to have
1900𓀴anything to do with each other.”
1901𓀴
1902𓀴Leslie looked over her shoulder;
 he was pleased to point out her
1903𓀴mistake--it was a
 very obvious one--and
 it at once put him at his ease.
1904𓀴He felt there could
 be nothing very
 formidable in a woman who could make
1905𓀴such a silly mistake
 in quite a simple sum.
1906𓀴
1907𓀴He sat down beside
 her, smiling and
 looking so utterly unlike the glum,
1908𓀴discontented youth
 she was accustomed
 to see that Edith could barely
1909𓀴conceal her astonishment.
1910𓀴
1911𓀴“I’ve got an awful
 lot to say to you,”
 he volunteered at last. “What a
1912𓀴jolly little room
 you have here--just
 the kind of things I like!”
1913𓀴
1914𓀴“Well, you must come and like
 them a little oftener,” said his
1915𓀴step-mother with
 a friendly smile.
1916𓀴
1917𓀴He glanced at her uneasily.
1918𓀴
1919𓀴“I expect I must
 seem an awful ass
 to you,” he remarked with sudden
1920𓀴candor.
1921𓀴
1922𓀴Edith shook her head.
1923𓀴
1924𓀴“Dear no,” she said,
 “nor am I a very
 terrible person either, when you
1925𓀴come to know me!”
1926𓀴
1927𓀴“Oh, you,” said the boy, flushing
 scarlet--“you’re ripping! I can’t
1928𓀴think why I’ve never
 noticed it before.”
1929𓀴
1930𓀴Edith concealed a
 smile at this belated
 tribute; she wondered what he
1931𓀴was going to notice next.
1932𓀴
1933𓀴“Would you mind,” he
 began anxiously--“are
 you quite sure you wouldn’t
1934𓀴mind, if I came
 here regularly--in
 between terms at Oxford, I
1935𓀴mean--instead of
 going to Mallows?”
1936𓀴
1937𓀴Edith gasped. Then she said
 very gently and gravely:
1938𓀴
1939𓀴“My dear Leslie,
 this is your home.”
1940𓀴
1941𓀴He got up and walked
 about; she hadn’t
 used her advantage over him; she
1942𓀴hadn’t even made him look a fool.
 He was almost willing to acknowledge
1943𓀴that he was one.
1944𓀴
1945𓀴“I think I’d like
 to tell you all about
 it,” he began, “if you’re sure I
1946𓀴sha’n’t bore you?”
1947𓀴
1948𓀴“No, you won’t bore me,”
 said his companion.
1949𓀴
1950𓀴“I daresay you know--I
 daresay you
 may have heard some talk about--about
1951𓀴Anastasia Falaise? Of course, you
 don’t know what she’s like; people
1952𓀴talk such confounded
 rot about her,
 especially women. You should hear
1953𓀴Aunt Etta. They say she’s old; of
 course, it’s all jealousy. She may be
1954𓀴twenty-five--that’s
 older than me,
 of course--I’m not quite twenty,”
1955𓀴(his nineteenth
 birthday had taken
 place a week previously), “but then
1956𓀴what’s five years?”
1957𓀴
1958𓀴His step-mother
 was not prepared to
 say off-hand what five years were;
1959𓀴they might be such different
 things; so she looked at the boy
1960𓀴sympathetically
 and shook her head.
1961𓀴
1962𓀴“People talk such beastly stuff
 about age,” the youth continued
1963𓀴fiercely, “and not
 knowing your own
 mind; why, of course, I know she’s
1964𓀴perfect. Why, Edith--Cleopatra,
 and
 Mary Queen of Scots, and Helen of
1965𓀴Troy--they couldn’t
 have been anything
 to Anastasia--she’s--she’s--well,
1966𓀴the poets are all really idiots;
 none of them describe her decently!”
1967𓀴
1968𓀴Edith looked as if
 she quite believed
 this; in her heart of hearts she
1969𓀴thought that the poets
 had under-estimated
 Horace, but that was very
1970𓀴probably because they were,
 generally speaking, men.
1971𓀴
1972𓀴“Do you know, I can’t believe in
 my luck, Edith--I can’t really; she
1973𓀴might have married princes, and
 she’s fond of me,” cried the boy.
1974𓀴
1975𓀴Edith’s eyes filled with sudden
 tears. The boy was very beautiful,
1976𓀴young, exquisitely
 shaped, with light
 curls and bright brown eyes, and
1977𓀴for the first time she was seeing
 his face alive and eager with the joy
1978𓀴of life!
1979𓀴
1980𓀴“I can quite believe it,
 Leslie,” she said gently.
1981𓀴
1982𓀴“And she’s promised to marry me,”
 he exclaimed exultantly, “in three
1983𓀴years’ time.”
1984𓀴
1985𓀴His step-mother jumped.
 This was not
 what she had been prepared to hear.
1986𓀴It came with a sudden
 shock. Horace
 had said the woman was old enough to
1987𓀴be the boy’s mother, and Horace
 was certain to be right.
1988𓀴
1989𓀴“Oh, Leslie!” she
 murmured, holding
 out her hands, vaguely troubled and
1990𓀴distressed. “Oh, Leslie!”
1991𓀴
1992𓀴“Oh, it’s all right,”
 said the boy,
 rising, “you’ll like her, I know;
1993𓀴and, fancy, Aunt
 Etta--well--I can
 hardly believe it; she tried to come
1994𓀴between us, and actually went and
 asked Anastasia to give me up. All my
1995𓀴life she’s tried to keep me away
 from dad and you--and now--now
1996𓀴Anastasia! I can’t
 forgive her,” said
 Leslie, “and I shouldn’t think you
1997𓀴would.”
1998𓀴
1999𓀴He took one of Edith’s
 hands and kissed it.
2000𓀴
2001𓀴“Oh, my dear boy,” she whispered,
 “you don’t know, you don’t understand
2002𓀴how she loved you!
 You see you did
 make a mistake, didn’t you? Just a
2003𓀴little one that didn’t
 matter really
 about me; don’t make another which
2004𓀴may matter terribly
 about your Aunt
 Etta. Ah, Leslie, she’s given up her
2005𓀴life for you--she
 meant it all for
 the best. You see she--she loves you.
2006𓀴Try to forgive her!”
2007𓀴
2008𓀴“I’d have forgiven
 her if she’d told
 me,” said the boy, “but she did it
2009𓀴on the sly. Father
 did it, too--he
 wrote some stupid letter; but then he
2010𓀴told me he was going to--he
 didn’t deceive me.”
2011𓀴
2012𓀴The boy choked suddenly.
2013𓀴
2014𓀴“Do you know,” he
 said, “I sometimes
 think you and dad have been most
2015𓀴awfully kind to me.”
2016𓀴
2017𓀴Edith’s quivering
 lips smiled, and
 her eyes shone as they had done ten
2018𓀴years ago through happy tears as
 she stood to welcome Horace’s little
2019𓀴son.
2020𓀴
2021𓀴“Oh, Leslie, Leslie!”
 she murmured.
2022𓀴
2023𓀴He was not a demonstrative
 young man,
 so he kicked at a footstool, and
2024𓀴gave rather a foolish laugh.
2025𓀴
2026𓀴“Well, it’ll all
 be different now,”
 he said. “Anastasia is most awfully
2027𓀴keen on my being
 nice to you and dad.
 She slanged me fearfully for not
2028𓀴living at home--pitched
 into me right and left.”
2029𓀴
2030𓀴“Did she?” said
 Edith thoughtfully.
 “I wonder why?”
2031𓀴
2032𓀴“Oh, she’s so awfully
 clever and generous,
 you know.” The boy went on:
2033𓀴“She said she was sure
 I’d been misunderstanding
 you all along, and that
2034𓀴the least I could do was
 to make it up to you now.”
2035𓀴
2036𓀴Edith suddenly rose
 to her feet, then
 she sat down again, but her hands
2037𓀴trembled, and there was a
 look of surprise in her eyes.
2038𓀴
2039𓀴“Have you,” she asked, “a picture
 of her to show me, Leslie?”
2040𓀴
2041𓀴The boy laughed shamefacedly.
2042𓀴
2043𓀴“I have her miniature,” he said;
 he drew out a little velvet case and
2044𓀴tossed it with a pretence
 of indifference
 into Edith’s lap. She held it
2045𓀴for a moment as if she dreaded
 what might meet her eye, and then,
2046𓀴opening it quickly, she gazed
 at the exquisite familiar face.
2047𓀴
2048𓀴“Oh, Leslie,” she cried,
 “it _is_ Helen of Troy!”
2049𓀴
2050𓀴The boy was delighted.
2051𓀴
2052𓀴“Well, she’s the
 most beautiful woman
 in the world to me,” he said. “I’m
2053𓀴glad you like it!”
2054𓀴
2055𓀴His step-mother sat staring as if
 spellbound at the little velvet case;
2056𓀴the boy took it from
 her unresisting hands.
2057𓀴
2058𓀴“If you feel like this about her,
 Edith,” he said, “will you say
2059𓀴something to my father
 for me--something,
 I mean, about her being
2060𓀴everything she ought
 to be, you know,
 and it not mattering her being a
2061𓀴little older than me--and really
 twenty-five is not very old, is it?”
2062𓀴
2063𓀴“I am forty,” said
 Edith irrelevantly.
2064𓀴
2065𓀴Leslie looked up compassionately.
2066𓀴
2067𓀴“Well,” he said
 reassuringly, “you
 aren’t really old yet, you know,
2068𓀴Edith.”
2069𓀴
2070𓀴“No, I’m not really old yet,”
 agreed his step-mother.
2071𓀴
2072𓀴Helen of Troy was forty-two.
2073𓀴
2074𓀴A long silence followed.
 The boy began
 to fidget: he thought he would go
2075𓀴and choose some flowers
 for Anastasia.
 He looked hesitatingly at Edith.
2076𓀴
2077𓀴“Promise you’ll do your best for
 me?” he asked, leaning over her.
2078𓀴
2079𓀴Edith raised her
 eves to his; they
 were strangely sad and tender.
2080𓀴
2081𓀴“Yes, Leslie,” she
 said. “I promise
 you that I will do my best for you.”
2082𓀴
2083𓀴He kissed her and
 went out of the room.
2084𓀴
2085𓀴
2086𓀴                
                   IX
2087𓀴
2088𓀴Anastasia was dressed
 to go out in
 the Park. It was an exquisite day of
2089𓀴early spring. Winter had lingered
 longer than usual and the green world
2090𓀴had been for some time pining and
 cheerless, an unfilled canvas waiting
2091𓀴for its artist--the sun. The park
 was a shimmering sea of verdant
2092𓀴new-born foliage and young spring
 flowers. Crocuses and daffodils and
2093𓀴hyacinths made summer
 in the midst of London.
2094𓀴
2095𓀴Everybody who was
 anybody wandered
 or drove or motored in its precincts,
2096𓀴or sat on the green chairs under
 the trees and looked at each other’s
2097𓀴clothes, and speculated
 why So-and-so
 was--or was not--with somebody
2098𓀴else; and somehow or other spring
 struck a note of freshness into even
2099𓀴the stalest speculations, and did
 its best to prick the heart towards
2100𓀴beauty and delight.
2101𓀴
2102𓀴Anastasia was dressed to join the
 distinguished throng. It was her
2103𓀴world, and she knew
 that she would
 be followed by whispers, criticisms,
2104𓀴and speculation,
 even as she would
 be joined by groups of privileged
2105𓀴young men, very good-looking,
 well-dressed,
 ardent, and most terribly
2106𓀴silly--and she knew
 that none of this
 would amuse her very much, and yet
2107𓀴that if it failed
 her, and when it
 failed her, there would be nothing
2108𓀴else. She was dressed
 in white and
 orange, and as she looked at the
2109𓀴superb curves of
 her figure, at the
 classical white face and wide dark
2110𓀴eyes, at the huge coils
 of her magnificent
 black hair, she smiled a
2111𓀴little. “Keats to-day,” she said
 to herself, “ye ardent marigolds!”
2112𓀴
2113𓀴Then she turned round and
 faced Edith Lestrange.
2114𓀴
2115𓀴“I came up unannounced,”
 said Edith.
 “I said you expected me. I don’t
2116𓀴know whether you did. Oh,
 Helen--Helen; it’s you!”
2117𓀴
2118𓀴Helen of Troy stood
 quite still, her
 arms dropped to her sides, and as
2119𓀴she stood there
 a change came over
 her face; it was the same face, and
2120𓀴yet the years came out in it--the
 suppressed, ignored, and baffled
2121𓀴years; she could no
 more have passed--even
 with gullible youth--for
2122𓀴twenty-five.
2123𓀴
2124𓀴Edith came forward,
 her hands outstretched.
2125𓀴
2126𓀴“Oh, Helen,” she
 said with a quiver
 in her voice, “am I so old you don’t
2127𓀴remember me--twenty years ago?”
2128𓀴
2129𓀴“Don’t!” said Helen of Troy.
2130𓀴
2131𓀴She moistened her
 lips and put her
 hands up to her throat, then suddenly
2132𓀴she began to laugh at first, just
 her old velvety laugh of music, and
2133𓀴then suddenly distorted,
 bitter laughter--terrible
 to listen to--like
2134𓀴harmony run mad.
2135𓀴
2136𓀴“Oh, I remember you!”
 she cried between
 the gusts of her laughter. “I
2137𓀴remember you all right, Edith.”
2138𓀴
2139𓀴Edith came forward
 quietly; her face
 was very white and her eyes looked
2140𓀴drawn and tired, but she drew the
 orange and white figure shaking with
2141𓀴its bitter laughter to the
 sofa and sat down beside her.
2142𓀴
2143𓀴“I know--I know,” she whispered
 gently; “don’t laugh so, Helen.”
2144𓀴
2145𓀴“It’s all so funny,”
 laughed Helen
 of Troy, “so ghastly, ridiculously,
2146𓀴agonizingly funny,
 and he might be
 your own son or mine, my dear--only
2147𓀴we haven’t any!”
2148𓀴
2149𓀴“We haven’t any,” repeated Edith.
 “Now, Helen, give me your hand. See,
2150𓀴it’s very cold--and
 now your other
 hand! The years have made no
2151𓀴difference--nothing has
 made any difference.
 You should have come to see
2152𓀴me. When did you first know
 I was his step-mother?”
2153𓀴
2154𓀴Helen had found her self-control
 again; she leaned back on the
2155𓀴sofa-cushion with yielded hands
 and half-shut eyes, gazing at her
2156𓀴companion.
2157𓀴
2158𓀴“Oh, not till Miss
 Lestrange came.
 I wasn’t going to marry him, or give
2159𓀴him another thought,
 you know; I was
 going to laugh him off gently, and
2160𓀴then she let out suddenly
 about you--and I saw!”
2161𓀴
2162𓀴“What did you see?” asked
 Edith almost sternly.
2163𓀴
2164𓀴“I saw your life,”
 said Helen of Troy,
 opening her eyes and fixing them
2165𓀴on her companion’s
 face. “I saw your
 life, Edith, and I see it now.”
2166𓀴
2167𓀴“I don’t think you
 do,” said Edith
 calmly, “because you have not acted
2168𓀴as if you did. Do you suppose I
 want to wreck the boy’s career?”
2169𓀴
2170𓀴“He’ll wreck his
 own career,” said
 Helen scornfully. “One rock or
2171𓀴another, or else
 some one must wrap
 him in cotton-wool. He’s a spoilt
2172𓀴peach--just that
 soft, little rotten
 spot a woman sees at once. _I_
2173𓀴don’t feel guilty.
 Of course, I saw
 what the she-cat had done--cut him
2174𓀴adrift from you, and
 made your marriage
 a divided thing. I remembered
2175𓀴everything you thought about love
 and marriage, and I guessed quickly
2176𓀴enough you’d had
 your heart caught
 between two stones, and were having
2177𓀴it crushed out of
 you. I thought if
 I used the boy he’d heal it all in
2178𓀴three years. You only wanted your
 little chance, my dear, to make him
2179𓀴love you from the
 bottom of his shallow
 little soul, and if your husband
2180𓀴saw that, why, I suppose,
 even he would
 be convinced that things weren’t
2181𓀴your fault.”
2182𓀴
2183𓀴“How do you know he thinks things
 are my fault now?” asked Edith
2184𓀴quickly.
2185𓀴
2186𓀴“Have you ever known
 a man who didn’t
 hold the woman who loves him
2187𓀴personally responsible
 for all the
 rubs of life?” asked Helen dryly.
2188𓀴
2189𓀴Edith did not answer--she smiled
 a little. After a moment’s pause she
2190𓀴said:
2191𓀴
2192𓀴“You’re my friend, Helen?”
2193𓀴
2194𓀴“Don’t speak as if I had dozens,”
 said Helen. “I’ve only had one, and I
2195𓀴don’t forget.”
2196𓀴
2197𓀴“Then you’ll laugh him
 away very gently--so
 gently that it won’t reach
2198𓀴very far down?” cried Edith.
2199𓀴
2200𓀴“There isn’t very far
 to reach,” replied
 Helen irritably. “I don’t see
2201𓀴why you always want to be saving
 people pain; pain does good.”
2202𓀴
2203𓀴“Does it?” asked
 Edith. Her eyes met
 Helen of Troy’s; they looked a long
2204𓀴time into each other’s eyes.
2205𓀴
2206𓀴“No,” said Helen at
 last, “it starves,
 it ages, it embitters, it doesn’t
2207𓀴do good.”
2208𓀴
2209𓀴“Well, I’d rather have it done to
 me than do it to other people,” said
2210𓀴Edith. “It’s rather
 more responsibility
 than I care to undertake.”
2211𓀴
2212𓀴“Oh, I don’t know!” said Helen of
 Troy with a reckless gesture; “it’s a
2213𓀴game like any other
 game. I wanted
 to pay back your score for you. I
2214𓀴knew _you’d_ never
 do it. I kept out
 of your way, I never let on, and I
2215𓀴didn’t suppose you’d find out for
 a day or two. I’m going to-morrow. I
2216𓀴thought the little
 fool couldn’t tell
 you enough for you to work on, the
2217𓀴first time he had spoken
 to you for years.”
2218𓀴
2219𓀴“He showed me your miniature,”
 said Edith gravely.
2220𓀴
2221𓀴Helen laughed.
2222𓀴
2223𓀴“My face is my fortune,” she said
 grimly. “Edith, I’ve made a lot of
2224𓀴money!”
2225𓀴
2226𓀴“Yes, dear--yes,”
 said Edith; and she
 spoke soothingly as you speak to a
2227𓀴hurt child.
2228𓀴
2229𓀴“I’ve made a lot
 of money,” repeated
 Helen of Troy. Then she looked away
2230𓀴towards the window
 and the swaying
 pots of flowers alive in the
2231𓀴sunshine. “And I’ve made nothing
 else,” she said with a little bitter
2232𓀴laugh.
2233𓀴
2234𓀴Edith did not speak, and the room
 seemed filled with an unanswerable
2235𓀴silence. Helen of
 Troy got up at last
 and moved restlessly to and fro.
2236𓀴
2237𓀴“I ought to be in
 the Park,” she said.
 “I’ve made heaps of engagements.
2238𓀴It doesn’t matter. Why doesn’t
 your husband love you, Edith?”
2239𓀴
2240𓀴“Oh, my dear--my dear!” murmured
 Edith, “don’t ask me that.”
2241𓀴
2242𓀴“But that’s just
 what I’m going to
 ask you,” said Helen, coming to a
2243𓀴stop in front of
 her friend. “Don’t
 pretend--with your eyes! Why, they
2244𓀴were so sad when you
 came in, I thought--I
 thought--the pain in them
2245𓀴would break everything
 in the room.”
2246𓀴
2247𓀴“My husband,” said Edith quietly,
 “is the best man in the world.”
2248𓀴
2249𓀴“As bad as that?”
 asked Helen, lifting
 her eyebrows. “Why, my dear, you
2250𓀴might as well have
 married an institution
 or a reformatory outright.”
2251𓀴
2252𓀴“No, not like that,” Edith
 said quickly; “he’s a dear!”
2253𓀴
2254𓀴“Something can generally
 be done with
 a dear,” said Helen reflectively,
2255𓀴“even a good dear. Edith, an idea
 has just occurred to me. The chief
2256𓀴difference between
 a bad man and a
 good is that you know what a bad man
2257𓀴wants and you don’t know
 what a good man wants.”
2258𓀴
2259𓀴Edith smiled.
2260𓀴
2261𓀴“I think you always know what the
 man you love wants, but you can’t
2262𓀴always give it to him,” she said.
2263𓀴
2264𓀴“Tell me about it,”
 Helen demanded
 briefly. And she sat down on the sofa
2265𓀴again.
2266𓀴
2267𓀴“There’s nothing to
 tell,” said Edith.
 “His first wife died a year after
2268𓀴their marriage,
 and he is satisfied
 with that. He wants a sober,
2269𓀴matrimonial kind of
 tie, with no romance.
 I have supplied more than he
2270𓀴needed, but he does not know it.”
2271𓀴
2272𓀴“And you thought when
 you married him--”
2273𓀴
2274𓀴“Oh, don’t ask me
 what I thought,”
 cried Edith passionately. “I
2275𓀴dreamed--and the people who dream
 get cast into pits. But all this is
2276𓀴beside the point,
 Helen. You’ve got
 to give this boy up, you know--and
2277𓀴do it so that he
 will not blow his
 brains out, or make some unprofitable
2278𓀴spectacle of himself
 to Etta and Horace.
 You haven’t said you would yet,
2279𓀴you know.”
2280𓀴
2281𓀴“I never knew any one
 so fond of promises;
 you ought to belong to a law
2282𓀴court or a registry
 or something,”
 said Helen impatiently. “Why should I
2283𓀴give the boy up? He is pretty and
 pleases my fancy. I can assure you my
2284𓀴fancy is very particular; it’s
 a great thing to get it pleased.”
2285𓀴
2286𓀴“You are going to
 do it because you
 want to please me more,” said Edith
2287𓀴imperturbably.
2288𓀴
2289𓀴“Don’t you see, you stupid woman,
 that it’ll settle your hash?” Helen
2290𓀴broke in; “the boy’ll find out
 somehow that you’re in it--”
2291𓀴
2292𓀴“I shall tell him,” Edith
 interposed quietly.
2293𓀴
2294𓀴“Oh, my Aunt Maria!”
 groaned Helen
 of Troy, “my sainted Aunt Maria!
2295𓀴You’ll tell him? And what good
 do you suppose that’ll do?”
2296𓀴
2297𓀴“I’m not responsible
 for results,”
 said Edith. “But I’ve got to tell
2298𓀴him.”
2299𓀴
2300𓀴“I’m glad I know nothing
 of the obligations
 of virtue,” said Helen. “I
2301𓀴understand paying for my fun, but
 I don’t see why you should pay for
2302𓀴other people’s.”
2303𓀴
2304𓀴“I couldn’t deceive Horace or the
 boy,” said Edith, “to save myself. I
2305𓀴don’t mind deceiving
 people at all
 for any other reason. Half of life is
2306𓀴mutually tolerated
 deceit, but not
 for purposes of self-protection; that
2307𓀴I don’t like, nor, my
 dear Helen, do you!”
2308𓀴
2309𓀴Helen did not reply
 to this; she merely
 nibbled her pen, which she had
2310𓀴taken up from an inlaid
 desk beside her.
2311𓀴
2312𓀴“I suppose you are going to bully
 me into this thing?” she observed
2313𓀴after a pause.
2314𓀴
2315𓀴“Dear me, yes,” said Edith,
 “that’s what I’m here for!”
2316𓀴
2317𓀴Helen laughed.
2318𓀴
2319𓀴“Very well, then,
 my dear,” she said;
 “without waiting to reflect on the
2320𓀴wits of the Lestrange family (and
 always excepting its head, who had, I
2321𓀴imagine, more than a suspicion of
 the fact), allow me to remark that
2322𓀴they should have
 a goose for their
 coat-of-arms. I’ve been married
2323𓀴twice, and so far
 as I know the second
 ceremony still holds good. For
2324𓀴professional purposes I do not
 lay much stress upon my husband’s
2325𓀴existence; privately,
 we prefer our
 own lives to each other’s. I don’t
2326𓀴need any pity. I never cared for
 either of my husbands, but I managed
2327𓀴both beautifully.
 What do you want
 me to say to your step-son now? I may
2328𓀴as well observe that
 in three years’
 time he would take it much better.”
2329𓀴
2330𓀴Edith hesitated.
2331𓀴
2332𓀴“I think you ought
 to tell him that
 you’re forty-two,” she said at
2333𓀴length.
2334𓀴
2335𓀴Helen threw back her
 head and laughed.
2336𓀴
2337𓀴“It isn’t twenty years ago,” she
 murmured. “It’s ten minutes. Now,
2338𓀴Edith, if you’ll take
 my advice you’ll
 not decide this yourself. You
2339𓀴seem to have overlooked for the
 moment the fact of your husband’s
2340𓀴existence. Does he
 know what happened
 twenty minutes--years ago--I
2341𓀴mean?”
2342𓀴
2343𓀴“Oh, yes,” said Edith;
 “I told him.”
2344𓀴
2345𓀴“Very well, then,”
 said Helen of Troy.
 “I happen to know that Leslie is
2346𓀴dining out to-night.
 I will, therefore,
 invite myself to dinner with
2347𓀴you. Do you trust me, Edith?”
2348𓀴
2349𓀴“You’re a most unscrupulous
 woman,”
 said Edith. “Still, you can’t do
2350𓀴much harm with a mere meal,
 so if you like we’ll risk it.”
2351𓀴
2352𓀴Helen stooped towards
 her and kissed her.
2353𓀴
2354𓀴“After all,” she said, “I’ve had
 something out of my life. I’ve had
2355𓀴this.”
2356𓀴
2357𓀴
2358𓀴                
                   X
2359𓀴
2360𓀴Horace was slightly
 surprised on coming
 down dressed for dinner to meet
2361𓀴in his wife’s sitting-room
 a lady of
 such widely-spread picture-postcard
2362𓀴fame. He had already
 seen Anastasia
 twice in the musical comedy which
2363𓀴she had made famous,
 but his wife’s
 introduction arrested him.
2364𓀴
2365𓀴“Horace,” she said, “this
 is Helen of Troy.”
2366𓀴
2367𓀴For a moment he was baffled by
 memory, and then suddenly the old
2368𓀴sacrifice of the
 impetuous girl who
 was now his strangely sensible wife
2369𓀴came back to him. He held
 out his hand at once.
2370𓀴
2371𓀴“I am most happy to meet Helen
 of Troy,” he said, smiling.
2372𓀴
2373𓀴There was no one
 at dinner, and the
 house-hold dignity, the little vivid
2374𓀴picture of delicate
 repose lived long
 in Anastasia’s memory. Horace was
2375𓀴an excellent host,
 and Edith was a
 loadstone for other people’s minds.
2376𓀴She drew out their best with
 a silent magnetic skill, hardly
2377𓀴participating so much as forming
 an atmosphere in which it was very
2378𓀴pleasant and easy to speak.
2379𓀴
2380𓀴“I always could say
 anything to Edith,”
 observed Anastasia to her host,
2381𓀴“but I had quite supposed that
 I should have to talk to you.”
2382𓀴
2383𓀴Horace laughed.
2384𓀴
2385𓀴“We’re so simple
 and dull,” he said.
 “We are like an old tune to a
2386𓀴practised singer; we
 give her an easy swing.”
2387𓀴
2388𓀴“Oh, you’re not dull,”
 said Anastasia;
 “it’s rather an art to be as
2389𓀴simple as all this,
 and I’ve never
 met it in my own people. We’re smart,
2390𓀴we’re clever, we’re
 attractive, we’re
 the most charming people in the
2391𓀴world, but we’re not simple.”
2392𓀴
2393𓀴“You can’t expect a young nation
 to have the quality of an old shoe,”
2394𓀴said Horace. “English people have
 done the same things for a very long
2395𓀴time. They stand on
 the basis of habit.
 Now all the Americans I ever met
2396𓀴wanted to be individual,
 personal,
 impressive--and they very often were.
2397𓀴When they were not, it was rather
 a strain to listen to them; but we
2398𓀴don’t want, as a rule, to be like
 that; it amuses us to have people do
2399𓀴it for us; but I
 expect that in our
 heart of hearts we don’t think it
2400𓀴very solid. There’s something in
 finding such an easy old track, and
2401𓀴knowing that among your own class
 you’ll find the same talk, the same
2402𓀴purpose, the same
 _genre_. I’m not
 sure it isn’t good for conversation
2403𓀴as well, because
 it makes you less
 self-conscious. You start with so
2404𓀴much that can be
 taken for granted.”
2405𓀴
2406𓀴Helen gave him a good
 deal of attention;
 she was thinking the man out;
2407𓀴he wasn’t in the
 least like his son,
 nor had she expected him to be. She
2408𓀴had imagined him
 to be good, solid,
 dull, and probably a shrewd man of
2409𓀴business; now she
 saw that only her
 first two adjectives held. He might
2410𓀴not see everything,
 but he saw what
 he looked at. The trouble really
2411𓀴began in his never having looked
 at his wife. He had accepted her,
2412𓀴proposed to her,
 married her, and she
 had done all the rest. The chances
2413𓀴were that she would go on doing
 it till she died, unless some one
2414𓀴interfered.
2415𓀴
2416𓀴“What he wants,”
 said Helen of Troy
 to herself, as she continued the
2417𓀴conversation, “is a shaking, and
 that is what he is going to get.”
2418𓀴
2419𓀴After dinner Horace
 accompanied them
 to his smoking-room, and Anastasia
2420𓀴cleared the field.
2421𓀴
2422𓀴“Edith,” she said,
 “do you remember
 my giving you an old silk shawl when
2423𓀴we stayed on the lakes;
 it was pretty,
 and warm, and soft, and fresh,
2424𓀴like one of the little clouds we
 used to see hover over the lovely
2425𓀴garden? I have an
 idea I want that
 shawl back to keep always; do you
2426𓀴know where it is?”
2427𓀴
2428𓀴Edith shook her head.
2429𓀴
2430𓀴“At the bottom of one of my old
 trunks I expect, where I keep my
2431𓀴treasures,” she said. “I could
 send it to you, perhaps.”
2432𓀴
2433𓀴“I want it right away,”
 said Anastasia
 calmly, in the tone which took
2434𓀴for granted that what she wanted
 right away would be immediately
2435𓀴forthcoming.
2436𓀴
2437𓀴Edith laughed.
2438𓀴
2439𓀴“And I’m to get it?” she asked.
2440𓀴
2441𓀴“You’re to get it,”
 said Anastasia,
 “and you needn’t hurry back, for I
2442𓀴want to talk to your
 husband about his boy.”
2443𓀴
2444𓀴Horace looked at Edith
 affectionately.
2445𓀴
2446𓀴“She can share all
 that,” he said.
2447𓀴
2448𓀴“You’re very kind,”
 said Anastasia,
 with hidden irony, “but anyway I
2449𓀴want that shawl.”
2450𓀴
2451𓀴Edith left them.
2452𓀴
2453𓀴“Now, Mr. Lestrange,”
 said Anastasia,
 suddenly sitting up and fixing him
2454𓀴with her eyes, “I’m
 not going to talk
 to you about your son much. I’ll
2455𓀴say this, and then I’ll leave the
 subject alone. He’s not like you. I
2456𓀴guess he’s like
 that picture you’ve
 got on the mantelpiece--the face is
2457𓀴selfish, tyrannical,
 weak and mean.
 Hush! I see you’re going to tell me
2458𓀴she’s dead. I know
 she’s dead, and
 Edith’s alive. She’s alive! How long
2459𓀴are you going to keep
 the living woman
 buried and the dead woman taking
2460𓀴all her share of life? How long
 is Edith to play second fiddle to a
2461𓀴memory which isn’t even true? If
 your first wife had lived you’d have
2462𓀴been worn tired of her by now. Do
 you suppose she’d have said, ‘I’ll
2463𓀴give my heart and every quivering
 nerve to serve this man’s comfort?
2464𓀴I’ll starve every
 sense I have got
 to give him friendship, since he’s so
2465𓀴blind he won’t take
 more? I’ll not
 let pain, or time, or just resentment
2466𓀴for a wrong he has
 allowed to take
 place against me make me bitter, or
2467𓀴old, or blunted’? Would your dead
 wife have acted this way, Horace
2468𓀴Lestrange?”
2469𓀴
2470𓀴Horace looked at
 his patent leather
 shoes fixedly. Once he tried to
2471𓀴interrupt her, but
 the tense sharpness
 of her voice struck his down into
2472𓀴silence. Something stirred in his
 heart that was not all anger and
2473𓀴indignation--it was pain--it was
 recognition! So he breathed hard and
2474𓀴said nothing. And
 for a moment the
 pitiless voice was still. Anastasia
2475𓀴was watching him.
2476𓀴
2477𓀴“When a man looks
 down at his shoes,
 you’re moving him,” she observed to
2478𓀴herself. “You can’t
 tell which way
 he’s going, but he’s being moved.”
2479𓀴
2480𓀴Then she went on:
2481𓀴
2482𓀴“I came here expecting
 to find you
 selfish and stupid,” she said; “and
2483𓀴you’re neither.
 You’re a live man,
 and yet you’ve lived with this woman
2484𓀴ten years and not
 loved her; you’ve
 looked at her and not seen her;
2485𓀴you’ve taken all she had to give,
 and you’ve never counted what it cost
2486𓀴her to give it to you. Oh, you’re
 slow, you English--you’re slow!”
2487𓀴
2488𓀴“We’re quick to act,” interrupted
 the man opposite her gently. He was
2489𓀴still looking at
 his shoes, and he
 spoke very quietly, but Anastasia
2490𓀴suddenly thrilled;
 she was not accustomed
 to be thrilled by anything a
2491𓀴man said.
2492𓀴
2493𓀴“I suppose that’s the meaning of
 English history,” she thought to
2494𓀴herself; aloud she merely
 deepened her note of scorn:
2495𓀴
2496𓀴“Quick?” she said.
 “Mr. Lestrange--ten
 years? I’m afraid it’s not quick
2497𓀴enough. Do you know
 what happens when
 a woman is unhappy too long? She
2498𓀴gets used to it. The
 habit of unhappiness
 sets in, the heart gets eaten
2499𓀴up, she gets haggard,
 and old, and
 sad; and not all the king’s horses
2500𓀴and all the king’s men can make
 the queen take to her throne again!
2501𓀴(That’s my own alteration,
 and rather
 a good one.) The truth of the
2502𓀴whole matter, Mr.
 Lestrange, is that
 you’ve made a domestic hack of a
2503𓀴woman who had the spirit
 of Joan of Arc--”
2504𓀴
2505𓀴“What on earth are
 you saying about
 Joan of Arc?” asked Edith’s voice
2506𓀴suddenly.
2507𓀴
2508𓀴Anastasia started. Horace
 never turned his head.
2509𓀴
2510𓀴“I was saying,” said
 Anastasia, “that
 she was burned alive at a stake by
2511𓀴the English intellect
 and the French nerves!”
2512𓀴
2513𓀴“I’ve found the
 shawl,” said Edith,
 “but the pink’s turned almost gray
2514𓀴in twenty years.”
2515𓀴
2516𓀴Anastasia laughed shortly. Edith
 looked quickly at her husband; in a
2517𓀴moment she knew
 that something had
 taken place--the very room seemed
2518𓀴tense with recent passion. A look
 of anxiety came into her eyes. What
2519𓀴had Helen said or done? She tried
 to stem the silence with the thin
2520𓀴stream of talk which is against
 the current of thought.
2521𓀴
2522𓀴Anastasia rose and
 held out her hand.
2523𓀴
2524𓀴“I’ve got to get home
 in time to oversee
 my packing. I leave to-morrow,”
2525𓀴she said, “and I’m going to write
 your boy a line, Mr. Lestrange; don’t
2526𓀴you or Edith worry.
 I’ll make things
 as easy as I can, and youth’s
2527𓀴elastic. It doesn’t
 break quickly.
 He won’t do anything violent, you can
2528𓀴depend on that; he
 talks conversational
 suicide, and that’s pretty safe.
2529𓀴Just whistle me
 a taxi, will you?”
2530𓀴
2531𓀴They went out into
 the hall with her.
2532𓀴
2533𓀴Horace said nothing.
 Once his eyes
 met hers. Horace’s eyes were blazing
2534𓀴with fairly steady
 anger, but it was
 not all anger. Edith looked white
2535𓀴and tired.
2536𓀴
2537𓀴“Am I never going to see you
 again, Helen?” she murmured.
2538𓀴
2539𓀴“In twenty years’ time,” said her
 friend. “Shan’t I make a nice old
2540𓀴woman?”
2541𓀴
2542𓀴Horace shook hands with her, and
 suddenly Helen of Troy smiled at
2543𓀴him--it was a golden,
 appealing, melting
 smile. Her eyes took it up and
2544𓀴held his in a kind
 of friendly laughter.
 Horace smiled back grimly.
2545𓀴
2546𓀴“I am sure,” he said, “I
 needn’t wish you success.”
2547𓀴
2548𓀴“You think I’ve
 got it?” she asked.
2549𓀴
2550𓀴“Yes. I think you’ve got
 it,” said Horace Lestrange.
2551𓀴
2552𓀴Then Edith kissed
 her, and standing
 together in the soft May weather the
2553𓀴husband and wife
 watched her drive
 off into the night. Helen of Troy did
2554𓀴not look back at them. She knew
 that they stood there together and
2555𓀴loneliness was at
 her heart like a
 knife. What were all the shadows that
2556𓀴surrounded her--the
 easy captives,
 the shallow victims of her radiant
2557𓀴beauty--to that quiet
 union of strength?
 Countless, countless, they
2558𓀴thronged the courts
 of memory, and
 unreal as the false dawn heralding
2559𓀴the long gray hours
 they passed away.
2560𓀴
2561𓀴“Oh, my God!” said Helen of Troy.
 “My men fight for me, but they leave
2562𓀴me, and they never give me rest!”
2563𓀴
2564𓀴                 *       
 *        *        *        *
2565𓀴
2566𓀴“I’m very tired,”
 said Edith gently
 to her husband. “I think, if you
2567𓀴don’t want me, I’ll go upstairs.”
2568𓀴
2569𓀴“Come into my study
 just one moment,”
 he urged. “There’s something I
2570𓀴want to talk to you about.”
2571𓀴
2572𓀴Once more the anxiety
 flashed back
 into his wife’s eyes. What had
2573𓀴happened? What had
 Helen said? She
 followed him quickly into his room
2574𓀴and closed the door.
2575𓀴
2576𓀴“Oh, no, I don’t want
 to talk to you,”
 said her husband suddenly, and at
2577𓀴the sound of his
 voice it seemed to
 Edith as if the whole earth changed.
2578𓀴
2579𓀴In a moment she was held--she
 was immersed--she was lifted into
2580𓀴uncontrollable joy. His arms were
 round her and his kisses were on her
2581𓀴hair, her cheek, her forehead,
 quick as his tears.
2582𓀴
2583𓀴“Oh, Edith,” he murmured, “my
 darling, all these years!”
2584𓀴
2585𓀴“No, no Horace,” she
 cried, struggling
 desperately against his pity,
2586𓀴against the terrible tenderness
 which seemed to drown the weak
2587𓀴resistance of her
 heart. “I was never
 unhappy. Did she tell you I was
2588𓀴unhappy? Why, I’ve
 been--you’ve been--oh,
 Horace, Horace! You’ve been
2589𓀴pitying me--I can’t bear that,
 you know--not that--let me go.”
2590𓀴
2591𓀴“Pitying you!” he
 laughed; he turned
 her face back with his hand and
2592𓀴gazed into her eyes.
2593𓀴
2594𓀴“I love you,” he said quickly. “I
 love you _best_--do you understand?”
2595𓀴
2596𓀴And suddenly all the sad habit
 of the years fell from her, the
2597𓀴weariness, the dull
 fret, the days
 of sober agony--they were as though
2598𓀴they had never been.
2599𓀴
2600𓀴The miracle of love
 swept her tears
 down into an ocean of bliss and
2601𓀴carried them into
 laughing waters.
 Horace pressed his lips to hers; and
2602𓀴they were all lost--the
 long intolerable
 hours--in the simplification of
2603𓀴a kiss.
2604𓀴
2605𓀴
2606𓀴

             CHAPTER I
2620𓀴
2621𓀴The Pinsents never saw any reason
 why they shouldn’t be modern
2622𓀴without--as they expressed
 it--going too far.
2623𓀴
2624𓀴They didn’t believe
 in the sheltered-life
 system, but that was perhaps
2625𓀴because they rather
 under-estimated
 their own idea of what constituted a
2626𓀴shelter.
2627𓀴
2628𓀴There were certain
 risks, of course,
 in allowing your daughters to play
2629𓀴mixed hockey, smoke
 cigarettes and
 belong to a suffrage movement (they
2630𓀴could attend meetings,
 but weren’t
 to throw stones). Still, it was
2631𓀴strange how little
 harm these concessions
 to modernity had done the
2632𓀴Pinsent girls.
2633𓀴
2634𓀴Bernard Shaw rolled off them
 like water from a duck’s back.
2635𓀴
2636𓀴Somewhere between
 the ages of fourteen
 and seventeen Mrs. Pinsent
2637𓀴presented her daughters
 with an approximate
 definition of life. Agatha
2638𓀴yawned and Edith said, “Oh, dear!
 We knew all that ages ago.” For a
2639𓀴moment Mrs. Pinsent
 became agitated.
 Had they, in spite of the
2640𓀴healthiness of their
 surroundings,
 come in contact with evil influences?
2641𓀴But she was reassured when Agatha
 explained that they had picked it up
2642𓀴from rabbits.
2643𓀴
2644𓀴Rose, who was more sensitive and
 less observant, gave her mother more
2645𓀴trouble than the others,
 but she acquiesced
 at last, that God must know
2646𓀴best, though it all
 seemed rather funny.
 They were not to earn their own
2647𓀴livings because
 later on--(later on
 being the term in which the Pinsent
2648𓀴parents envisaged
 their retreat from
 this world) they would have plenty
2649𓀴of money; but they were expected
 to develop hobbies.
2650𓀴
2651𓀴The eldest girls
 developed splendid
 hobbies. Agatha, who was the
2652𓀴plainest of the three, became a
 lawn tennis champion with a really
2653𓀴smashing serve.
 Edith distinguished
 herself by writing a history of one
2654𓀴of our western counties.
 She rode all
 over it on a bicycle and stayed at
2655𓀴vicarages by herself.
 She earned a
 hundred pounds by this adventure and
2656𓀴had a particularly pleasant
 notice in the “Spectator.”
2657𓀴
2658𓀴Rose was rather slower
 at taking anything
 up. She had had pneumonia when
2659𓀴she was at school, and it had
 left her nominally but not at all
2660𓀴obstructively delicate.
2661𓀴
2662𓀴She played an excellent
 game of hockey
 and was her father’s favorite.
2663𓀴
2664𓀴It was really for
 Rose’s sake that
 they all decided to go to Rome.
2665𓀴
2666𓀴They thought Rose would
 almost certainly
 settle down to something after
2667𓀴that, and it would be good for
 Edith, who, now she had finished
2668𓀴Somersetshire, might
 like to begin on Rome.
2669𓀴
2670𓀴She could at any rate compare the
 different types of architecture. A
2671𓀴friend of hers,
 a Mr. Bunning, said
 there wasn’t any architecture in
2672𓀴Rome, but you could
 never be quite
 sure what Mr. Bunning meant. Edith
2673𓀴hadn’t been quite
 sure for several
 years--nor apparently had Mr.
2674𓀴Bunning, but perhaps their going
 to Rome might help him to find out.
2675𓀴Agatha was very
 good-natured about
 it; she said she thought Rome would
2676𓀴do as well as anywhere else.
2677𓀴
2678𓀴The Pinsents were
 a most accommodating
 family and though, of course,
2679𓀴they sometimes quarreled, it was
 all in a loud, direct, natural way,
2680𓀴which generally ended in chaff.
2681𓀴
2682𓀴They never quarreled
 with Rose as much
 as with each other because of her
2683𓀴having been rather
 delicate, still
 they chaffed her a good deal. She
2684𓀴wouldn’t have liked
 it if they hadn’t.
2685𓀴
2686𓀴They knew they weren’t like other
 families of their class and standing;
2687𓀴they prided themselves on talking
 to people in railway carriages and
2688𓀴even crossing the
 Channel. Of course,
 they were particularly good
2689𓀴sailors but even if they hadn’t
 been they would have been nice and
2690𓀴friendly and not at all
 stuck up about being sick.
2691𓀴
2692𓀴Agatha was thinking of marrying a
 Canadian who took most magnificent
2693𓀴back-handers, Edith
 was still wondering
 what Mr. Bunning meant, but Rose
2694𓀴was perfectly free.
2695𓀴
2696𓀴She’d had two proposals, but both
 of them had been from men she had
2697𓀴known all her life and liked most
 awfully--but not in that way. So that
2698𓀴she’d had, as Mrs. Pinsent put
 it to her husband, “quite a lot of
2699𓀴experience for twenty-one and
 none of the bother of it.”
2700𓀴
2701𓀴Mr. Pinsent growled and said that
 if Rose married the right kind of man
2702𓀴she never would have any bother.
2703𓀴
2704𓀴Mrs. Pinsent looked thoughtful;
 she didn’t want to think that Mr.
2705𓀴Pinsent was the
 wrong kind of man,
 it would have been dreadful after
2706𓀴being married to him
 for thirty years.
 Still, she couldn’t honestly have
2707𓀴said that she hadn’t
 had any bother with him.
2708𓀴
2709𓀴Probably Mr. Pinsent
 had forgotten
 it; men do not remember that kind of
2710𓀴thing in the same way.
2711𓀴
2712𓀴They chose a French hotel in Rome
 because they thought it would be more
2713𓀴Italian, and when
 they arrived there
 everything was just as foreign as
2714𓀴possible, which was
 what the Pinsents
 wanted--provided that they could
2715𓀴get enough hot water.
2716𓀴
2717𓀴The Hotel le Roy was even for
 Rome extraordinarily “black.” Its
2718𓀴_clientèle_ was
 composed of French
 priests, their sisters, ladies of
2719𓀴pronounced age and
 severity, one or
 two French families of prehistoric
2720𓀴claims, small means
 and a son at a
 seminary, and a few Dutch Catholics
2721𓀴who were, if anything, blacker
 than the French, but distinctly
2722𓀴pleasanter to the English. Black
 French Catholics do not like English
2723𓀴Protestants. The war
 may have softened
 this feeling, but this episode
2724𓀴took place a year
 before the war, when
 the _Entente Cordiale_ was looked
2725𓀴upon as a Socialist blunder to be
 sharply counteracted in private by a
2726𓀴studied coldness of manner.
2727𓀴
2728𓀴Mrs. Pinsent, whose
 French the whole
 family relied upon, did nothing to
2729𓀴improve the situation.
 She said to
 Madame la Comtesse de Brenteuil, who
2730𓀴couldn’t very well
 help going up in
 the lift with her, “Isn’t it a pity
2731𓀴the Vatican shuts
 so often for church
 things? They say we sha’n’t be
2732𓀴able to get into
 the Sistine chapel
 in Holy Week, and one of my
2733𓀴daughters is writing an article
 on the Sibyls--it’s really most
2734𓀴annoying!”
2735𓀴
2736𓀴Madame de Brenteuil
 looked at Mrs.
 Pinsent as if she were a smut that
2737𓀴had fallen on her sleeve; then,
 with a weary irony, she observed,
2738𓀴“Perhaps, Madame,
 the English do not
 realize that the Holy Father is a
2739𓀴Catholic?” Mrs. Pinsent was eager
 to reassure her as to Anglo-Saxon
2740𓀴intuitions. She
 said, “Oh, yes--we
 quite understand his own personal
2741𓀴views--but it isn’t as if Rome
 really belonged to him, is it?”
2742𓀴
2743𓀴Fortunately the lift
 stopped. It was
 not Madame de Brenteuil’s _étage_,
2744𓀴but she got out.
2745𓀴
2746𓀴After this incident
 no French person
 in the Le Roy spoke to Mrs. Pinsent
2747𓀴or her daughters, so that it was
 rather difficult for Léon Legier to
2748𓀴begin--especially
 as he was a third
 cousin to the Comtesse, and _lié_ to
2749𓀴almost everybody
 there. He had made
 up his mind to begin from the moment
2750𓀴that Rose Pinsent
 dropped a breakfast
 roll and blushed as she stooped to
2751𓀴pick it up.
2752𓀴
2753𓀴He had never seen
 such a blush before
 on any woman’s face, and any color
2754𓀴he had failed to surprise
 upon a woman’s
 face he had naturally supposed
2755𓀴could not exist.
2756𓀴
2757𓀴Apparently it did,
 for Rose had it.
 Her blush was as fine in hue as that
2758𓀴of a pink tulip and as delicate
 as a winter cloud at dawn.
2759𓀴
2760𓀴It swept up in a
 wave from her white
 throat into her pale, silky, fair
2761𓀴hair, and the fact
 that she suddenly
 discovered Léon was observing her
2762𓀴did not tend to
 decrease her color.
 Léon Legier made his opportunity
2763𓀴that evening in the
 hall. The porter
 was explaining to Mrs. Pinsent what
2764𓀴time to start for
 Tivoli the following
 morning. His English was limited
2765𓀴and he altered the train hour to
 suit the convenience of the foreign
2766𓀴tongue. The greater inconvenience
 of missing the train had not occurred
2767𓀴to him until Léon intervened.
2768𓀴
2769𓀴Subsequently Léon discovered that
 almost all the porter’s other
2770𓀴information suffered from similar
 readjustments of language, and he and
2771𓀴Mrs. Pinsent sat
 down in the lounge
 to revise the day’s excursion. Mrs.
2772𓀴Pinsent should, perhaps,
 have thought
 of her daughters, but Léon gave
2773𓀴her no time to think
 of her daughters.
 He focused her attention upon
2774𓀴herself. She felt
 herself young again,
 almost dangerous; the young man
2775𓀴before her apologetic, diffident,
 with exquisite manners, was so
2776𓀴obviously attracted
 by her and intent
 on all that she had to tell him,
2777𓀴she had not the heart to cut the
 conversation short. Later on Mr.
2778𓀴Pinsent joined them.
 He was delighted
 to find another man to talk to in
2779𓀴his own tongue, and
 who was obviously
 acquainted with the name of Lloyd
2780𓀴George.
2781𓀴
2782𓀴It fortunately never
 transpired that
 Léon had confused the name of the
2783𓀴then Chancellor of the Exchequer
 with that of a horse who had won the
2784𓀴Derby.
2785𓀴
2786𓀴Mr. Pinsent told Léon
 what the English
 Government really meant and
2787𓀴attacked the Italian
 railway system.
 Léon listened politely, and it was
2788𓀴only at the end
 of the conversation
 that Mr. Pinsent discovered his
2789𓀴young foreign friend
 was after all
 merely French. Not that Mr. Pinsent
2790𓀴minded Frenchmen--but they could
 hardly be held responsible for the
2791𓀴state of Italian railways.
2792𓀴
2793𓀴In spite of his nationality,
 however,
 Léon was able to give Mr. Pinsent
2794𓀴the name of a remarkably good
 wine to be procured at Tivoli; he
2795𓀴regretted that the best place to
 lunch required a slight knowledge of
2796𓀴how to order Italian
 dishes. Mr. Pinsent
 said it was a pity Léon wasn’t
2797𓀴going with them.
 Léon only hesitated
 enough not to appear over-eager;
2798𓀴his deprecatory,
 half-delighted eyes
 sought Mrs. Pinsent’s, and she said
2799𓀴quickly, “But perhaps
 you could come
 with us?” Léon produced his card.
2800𓀴The Pinsents gave him theirs
 on which was written “Rocketts,
2801𓀴Thornton-in-the Hedges,”
 and on Léon’s
 was written, No. 9, Faubourg St.
2802𓀴Germain, Paris, and there was no
 one there to point out the deadly
2803𓀴disparity between
 the two addresses.
2804𓀴
2805𓀴
2806𓀴                  
             CHAPTER II
2807𓀴
2808𓀴The next day was glorious,
 a spacious,
 sunny, golden Roman day. The air
2809𓀴across the Campagna
 was delicate and
 keen. The Cascades at Tivoli fell
2810𓀴in tumultuous rushes out
 of their purple caverns.
2811𓀴
2812𓀴The tiny temple of
 the Sibyls caught
 itself up against the sharpness of
2813𓀴the sky. It hung, perilous
 and delicate,
 above the cliff like a little
2814𓀴weather-beaten storm-tossed
 shell.
2815𓀴
2816𓀴Léon made no attempt
 to talk to Rose.
 He hardly looked at her, but he
2817𓀴persistently observed her. He saw
 that she had in some sense which had
2818𓀴been denied her family,
 imagination and warmth.
2819𓀴
2820𓀴He surprised in her a sympathy of
 attention different from the playful
2821𓀴kindness of her sisters.
2822𓀴
2823𓀴Agatha and Edith
 were from the first
 jolly with Léon. They cultivated,
2824𓀴with masculine acquaintances,
 a slightly
 jocular tone, and the humor of
2825𓀴this was deepened, of course,
 by Léon’s being a Frenchman.
2826𓀴
2827𓀴They gambolled cheerfully about
 him, much like heavy sheep dogs
2828𓀴good-humoredly greeting
 a greyhound.
2829𓀴
2830𓀴Léon accommodated
 his pace to theirs,
 he met them half-way, but he
2831𓀴privately thought they
 weren’t like women at all.
2832𓀴
2833𓀴He took Agatha round the little
 temple and Edith to the foot of the
2834𓀴highest waterfall.
 He let their niceness
 (for he recognized with a rare
2835𓀴leap of the imagination that they
 were being nice to him) expand into
2836𓀴unconscious revelations.
2837𓀴
2838𓀴He allowed their
 frank communications
 to slip over the polished surface
2839𓀴of his manner like
 leaves borne on
 the waters that dashed past them.
2840𓀴Once or twice he arrested
 the floating
 leaves with the point of his
2841𓀴stick, and once or
 twice in the flood
 of Edith’s careless chatter he
2842𓀴held, very slightly,
 the point of his
 mind against a special revelation.
2843𓀴
2844𓀴He gathered that
 the Pinsents were
 very well off. It wasn’t that they
2845𓀴ever spoke of money,
 but the tremendous
 amount of things you had to
2846𓀴have, the bother of _salonslits_
 and the burden of expensive hotels
2847𓀴filtered through their
 wider statements
 of having to think twice as to
2848𓀴whether they’d go on to Sicily or
 not. They deplored prices, but they
2849𓀴invariably chose the best of what
 there was. Léon listened carefully,
2850𓀴but he hadn’t at first
 any real intentions.
2851𓀴
2852𓀴Rose pleased him.
 She was an unknown
 English type. A strange creature,
2853𓀴as independent as
 if she were married,
 and as innocent as if she had
2854𓀴never seen a man.
2855𓀴
2856𓀴He decided to devote
 himself a little
 to studying her, and in order to
2857𓀴do this he had, of course,
 to accept the Pinsent family.
2858𓀴
2859𓀴To Mr. Pinsent he could
 only be attentive.
 He found him an English club
2860𓀴and was delighted to
 observe the increasing
 use which Mr. Pinsent made
2861𓀴of it. Mrs. Pinsent, however, was
 comparatively easy to handle. She was
2862𓀴a woman with the
 maternal instinct,
 and with her Léon found it easy to
2863𓀴be candid.
2864𓀴
2865𓀴He told her that
 he had just finished
 his military service and was now
2866𓀴taking a little “voyage”
 before settling
 down. He talked a good deal
2867𓀴about his mother,
 who occupied herself
 with good works in Paris; his
2868𓀴father he mentioned less, and the
 works that occupied him not at all.
2869𓀴Nevertheless, it
 could be seen that
 he had a great affection for both
2870𓀴his parents and no
 brothers and sisters.
2871𓀴
2872𓀴“I expect that’s
 why he likes,” Mrs.
 Pinsent explained to her husband,
2873𓀴“to be so much with the girls.”
2874𓀴
2875𓀴It was three days before Léon
 found himself alone with Rose.
2876𓀴
2877𓀴She had begun to
 feel a little out
 of this gay stranger’s intimacy. It
2878𓀴seemed to Rose as
 if Léon purposely
 avoided her, and yet, in a way,
2879𓀴which was very strange
 to her, their
 eyes sometimes met, and then he
2880𓀴seemed to be telling
 her something
 as direct as a penny and as
2881𓀴articulate as the
 cobblestones of Rome.
2882𓀴
2883𓀴Then all of a sudden,
 breathlessly,
 without preparation, she found
2884𓀴herself alone with
 him in the Campagna.
2885𓀴
2886𓀴Mr. Pinsent had
 said that the girls
 were on no account to go outside the
2887𓀴walls of Rome by themselves.
2888𓀴
2889𓀴He hadn’t made it perfectly clear
 why he put this obstacle to their
2890𓀴general freedom,
 but he’d mentioned
 when pressed by Agatha, malarial
2891𓀴fever and savage
 Abruzzi sheep dogs.
2892𓀴
2893𓀴“So I expect I shall just have
 to go to a gallery instead,” Rose
2894𓀴explained to Léon
 in the hall. “Edith
 has gone off with some one to see
2895𓀴a fountain, and won’t be back for
 hours.” Léon hesitated, then he said,
2896𓀴“How far does the
 wonderful English
 freedom extend? Is it an
2897𓀴impertinence that
 I should offer to
 take you--wherever you wish to go?”
2898𓀴
2899𓀴“Oh, thank you very much. Yes, of
 course I could go with you. . . .”
2900𓀴Rose answered a little
 slowly. It seemed
 to her in some strange way that
2901𓀴her freedom had ceased
 to be menaced
 by her father and mother, but not
2902𓀴to have become any
 the more secure.
2903𓀴
2904𓀴She couldn’t have said
 that she disliked
 the sense of danger, but she
2905𓀴knew quite well
 what increased it.
 It was Léon’s saying as they stood
2906𓀴for a moment outside
 the street door,
 “Do you know it is since three
2907𓀴days--I have been
 waiting for this?”
2908𓀴
2909𓀴They took the tram
 to San Giovanni
 Laterano, and as it shuffled and
2910𓀴shrieked its clamorous
 way through
 narrow streets and wide piazzas,
2911𓀴under old yellow
 walls and through
 long white modern tunnels, a new
2912𓀴sensation came to Rose Pinsent.
2913𓀴
2914𓀴She had always supposed that what
 she liked best in a man was his being
2915𓀴tremendously manly, and by manly
 the Pinsents meant impervious to the
2916𓀴wills of others,
 abrupt in speech,
 and taking up everywhere a good deal
2917𓀴of space.
2918𓀴
2919𓀴But Léon was masculine in quite a
 different way and yet no one could
2920𓀴doubt his possessing
 that particular quality.
2921𓀴
2922𓀴The form it took
 with him was that
 Rose became suddenly conscious of his
2923𓀴physical presence. She noticed as
 she had never noticed in any man
2924𓀴before, his smallest
 personal habits,
 the flutter of his fine hard eyes,
2925𓀴the scrupulous neatness and grace
 of his person, and, above all, the
2926𓀴alert and faultless
 precision with
 which in any direction he met her
2927𓀴half-way.
2928𓀴
2929𓀴He gave her from moment to moment
 the whole of his indulgent intensity.
2930𓀴No man had ever
 looked at her like
 this before, so read her mind and
2931𓀴forced her in return
 to read his own!
2932𓀴
2933𓀴The tram was crowded
 and Léon stood
 above her, holding on to a strap and
2934𓀴looking down at her with laughing
 eyes. “You are thinking something of
2935𓀴me, Mademoiselle,”
 he said at last.
 “Confess it is a comparison, not, of
2936𓀴course, to my advantage.
 Tell me, then,
 to whom are you comparing me, in
2937𓀴what do I fall short?”
2938𓀴
2939𓀴Rose tried to frown. “Why should
 you suppose I am thinking of you at
2940𓀴all?” she ventured.
 Léon laughed softly.
 “Why indeed?” he murmured. “And
2941𓀴yet why should you not? Here you
 are, you and I; we have not yet
2942𓀴exchanged half-a-dozen
 words, and now
 we are to be together for, I hope,
2943𓀴three hours, and all these last
 days I have been waiting for these
2944𓀴hours--planning for
 them, arranging,
 as it were, my life to meet them.
2945𓀴Surely you, who
 have not prevented
 my obtaining them, must now be giving
2946𓀴a thought to what
 I am like? It would
 be droll to go for a ride on a
2947𓀴strange horse and not to look
 at it, not question a little its
2948𓀴character, how shall
 we put it--its
 pace? Would you think less of the
2949𓀴companionship of a man?”
2950𓀴
2951𓀴Rose drew in her
 breath sharply. Léon
 had a way of putting things which
2952𓀴was very exciting, but
 not, perhaps, quite nice.
2953𓀴
2954𓀴“But,” she said,
 “of course we have
 thought of you--Mother and Father,
2955𓀴they thought you
 were--” she paused,
 breathless. Léon came to her
2956𓀴assistance. “Respectable?
 Oh, yes,”
 he said easily. “But that doesn’t go
2957𓀴very far, does it?
 Simply to go for
 an expedition with some one who is
2958𓀴respectable! Your
 excellent Mr. Thomas
 Cook could provide you with that.
2959𓀴You might even procure
 for a few francs
 more a gentleman to give you a
2960𓀴lecture! Really, Mademoiselle,
 I had flattered myself that your
2961𓀴imagination had dealt with
 me a trifle more directly!”
2962𓀴
2963𓀴Rose tacitly admitted this claim.
 “Agatha and Edith thought you awfully
2964𓀴jolly,” she said hurriedly. “So I
 didn’t see, I mean I didn’t mind when
2965𓀴you suggested coming
 out with me.”
2966𓀴
2967𓀴Léon laughed again.
 “But I am afraid,”
 he said, “that I sha’n’t be in
2968𓀴the least with you
 what I was like
 with Mademoiselles Agatha and
2969𓀴Edith--‘awfully jolly.’
 I do not think
 of you in those terms. You will
2970𓀴have to decide for
 yourself and not
 take anybody’s word for it what I am
2971𓀴like to you.”
2972𓀴
2973𓀴Rose said nothing.
 She was glad that
 they had to get out at the foot of
2974𓀴the Lateran steps.
2975𓀴
2976𓀴They took a little carriage which
 went very fast through the swollen,
2977𓀴sallow suburb; it
 soon left behind
 it the trams, the cobblestones and
2978𓀴the shuffling wine carts. Almost
 at once the Campagna was upon them,
2979𓀴vaguely breaking
 away from the farms
 and the eucalyptus trees into
2980𓀴soft-breathing, deep,
 unbroken emptiness.
2981𓀴
2982𓀴They wandered out over the grass
 to the ruin of a villa, an old pink
2983𓀴tower and a group
 of umbrella pines.
2984𓀴
2985𓀴“It asks to be sketched,
 doesn’t it?”
 Léon observed. “And now you will
2986𓀴have to be very definite,
 Mademoiselle.
 It won’t do for you to suppose
2987𓀴that you can judge
 of the Campagna
 without a glance, as if it were
2988𓀴merely a new masculine
 acquaintance!”
2989𓀴
2990𓀴He opened her camp-stool
 and gravely
 placed himself on an old wall
2991𓀴behind her. “Vous y êtes,”
 he asserted, “begin!”
2992𓀴
2993𓀴But Rose didn’t
 begin. She had been
 thinking of what he had asked her.
2994𓀴Perhaps she hadn’t
 been quite frank.
 The Pinsents as a family thought it
2995𓀴a sin not to be quite frank.
2996𓀴
2997𓀴“I _was_ thinking about
 you,” she admitted.
 “I mean myself; I thought--I
2998𓀴thought you weren’t at
 all like an Englishman!”
2999𓀴
3000𓀴Léon laughed gently.
 “What a discovery,”
 he said. “I am not like an
3001𓀴Englishman--I! And did you want
 me to be? You are disappointed,
3002𓀴perhaps?”
3003𓀴
3004𓀴The wonderful pink
 color deepened in
 her face. “No,” she said, “I am not
3005𓀴a bit disappointed--I like
 people to be different.”
3006𓀴
3007𓀴“Thank you, Mademoiselle,”
 he said
 with sudden gravity. “You relieve me
3008𓀴very much, for that
 is one thing I
 could not change for you--I could not
3009𓀴be less a Frenchman.”
3010𓀴
3011𓀴Still she did not
 begin her sketch.
 “You are tired?” he asked her. “Rest
3012𓀴then, and don’t trouble to make
 a picture on that little strip of
3013𓀴canvas. Nothing you can do there
 will, I assure you, be half as
3014𓀴successful as what you are doing,
 by just sitting where you are.”
3015𓀴
3016𓀴She was sure he was flirting now,
 but what she wasn’t sure was how to
3017𓀴stop it. She wondered
 if Edith or Agatha
 knew, but it flashed across her
3018𓀴in a terrible moment
 of disloyalty
 that perhaps neither of them had ever
3019𓀴been put to the proof. “I don’t
 think you ought to say that kind of
3020𓀴thing--” she said a
 little uncomfortably.
3021𓀴
3022𓀴“But why not?” Léon
 urged. “Why do
 you not wish me to take pleasure in
3023𓀴your beauty? And
 if I take it, would
 it not be rude and ungracious not
3024𓀴to express it? For
 my part I believe
 only in the truth. If it is
3025𓀴agreeable--good!
 Let us enjoy it. If
 it is disagreeable, let us bear it.
3026𓀴But why should we
 try to avoid it?
 Besides we can never avoid it. If we
3027𓀴choose to shut our
 eyes to the truth
 it will take us by surprise. Is
3028𓀴that the way you like to
 be taken, Mademoiselle?”
3029𓀴
3030𓀴Rose was not a stupid
 girl; she gave
 Léon a fleeting glance; there was
3031𓀴just the delicate
 hint of laughter
 in it, her lips trembled at the
3032𓀴upturned corners.
 “I don’t like being
 taken at all,” said Rose sedately,
3033𓀴returning to her sketch.
3034𓀴
3035𓀴It occurred to her
 afterwards this
 was not, perhaps, the best way to
3036𓀴stop flirting.
3037𓀴
3038𓀴They came back rather
 late for tea,
 but Mr. and Mrs. Pinsent were not at
3039𓀴all uneasy about
 them. They didn’t
 look feverish and they hadn’t seen
3040𓀴any savage Abruzzi dogs.
3041𓀴
3042𓀴
3043𓀴                  
            CHAPTER III
3044𓀴
3045𓀴For a Frenchman
 of the type of Léon
 Legier there are a great many ways
3046𓀴of being in love; there are also
 several goals. You needn’t, as he
3047𓀴himself expressed it, finish the
 game in order to have received your
3048𓀴entertainment.
3049𓀴
3050𓀴In the case of Rose Pinsent, Léon
 wasn’t at first very serious, he was
3051𓀴out for the fine shades. He had
 never had an intimacy with an
3052𓀴Englishwoman before.
 It was simply
 a nationality he didn’t know, and he
3053𓀴found it touching.
3054𓀴
3055𓀴For her sake he led the Pinsents
 in compact and cheerful batches into
3056𓀴unknown churches and gave them on
 unfrequented hillsides splendid Roman
3057𓀴views.
3058𓀴
3059𓀴He never made a visible point of
 the few moments alone he managed to
3060𓀴snatch with Rose.
3061𓀴
3062𓀴She took these moments
 with a certain
 unexacting grace which pleased
3063𓀴him.
3064𓀴
3065𓀴It was as if she had a special
 pleasure which never amounted to
3066𓀴expectation in his
 presence. Her grave
 blue eyes never claimed him, but
3067𓀴when he signaled his own joy into
 hers--he met with no rebuff. He had
3068𓀴passed certain barriers
 with her and
 she made no attempt to set them up
3069𓀴again.
3070𓀴
3071𓀴She was secretly
 afraid, not of him,
 but of being so different when they
3072𓀴were alone together.
 She tried very
 hard to be just the same as she was
3073𓀴when those queens
 of chaff, Agatha
 and Edith, presided over their small
3074𓀴festivities.
3075𓀴
3076𓀴She had never supposed
 before you could
 have two relations with the same
3077𓀴person, without doing
 anything wrong,
 and yet the most rigid of her
3078𓀴scruples failed to warn her that
 when she and Léon were together they
3079𓀴did anybody any harm.
3080𓀴
3081𓀴Rose would have stopped
 all “nonsense”
 at once; what she couldn’t stop
3082𓀴was the gradual dangerous
 tenderness,
 growing touch by touch under the
3083𓀴hand of a master.
3084𓀴
3085𓀴She tried not to
 think too much about
 Léon, and as long as he was with
3086𓀴them she found that
 she succeeded.
3087𓀴
3088𓀴Everything became
 so interesting and
 so vivid--but when Léon was out of
3089𓀴their sight, buried
 in obscure private
 affairs, hidden, perhaps, by his
3090𓀴French relations
 whom he persistently
 excused to the Pinsents as being
3091𓀴poor dear people, so
 terribly provincial
 and shy! Rose found Rome
3092𓀴wonderfully little
 of an absorption--she
 was forced to consider that
3093𓀴what she really needed
 was, like her
 sisters, some definite active goal.
3094𓀴Her mind became set upon a hobby.
 She felt if she had that, it wouldn’t
3095𓀴really matter whether
 Rome was interesting
 or not. She could not have
3096𓀴told quite how the idea came to
 her; perhaps it was because little
3097𓀴Italian children in the streets
 looked so sweet--but she suddenly
3098𓀴thought she would like, when she
 got back to England, to have a nice
3099𓀴little home in the
 country for children
 to get well in, quite poor
3100𓀴people’s children--only
 they would
 be washed there, of course, and
3101𓀴probably have curly
 hair. She told
 Léon about it one day when they were
3102𓀴in St. Maria in Trastevere and
 had snatched a moment to go off by
3103𓀴themselves into the
 sacristy, to admire
 what Baedeker so aptly describes
3104𓀴as “the admirable ducks.”
3105𓀴
3106𓀴“Papa,” Rose explained
 to Léon, “had
 been so kind, he thought it could
3107𓀴be managed.” For a moment Léon
 looked in silence at the admirable
3108𓀴ducks--and then he
 laughed a gentle,
 caressing laugh and flushed a
3109𓀴little, fixing his hard bright
 eyes on her upturned face.
3110𓀴
3111𓀴“But Mademoiselle,”
 he said, “hasn’t
 it occurred to you that to have
3112𓀴your own children--nice
 little healthy
 ones--wouldn’t that be just as
3113𓀴amusing and not quite
 as expensive for Papa?”
3114𓀴
3115𓀴It seemed as if Rose’s
 very heart had
 blushed under his eyes. She wanted
3116𓀴for a moment to go
 away from him--to
 hide from out of his sight.
3117𓀴
3118𓀴She said quickly
 and vaguely, “Oh,
 I don’t know--one doesn’t think about
3119𓀴such things.” Léon said, “Doesn’t
 one? I assure you I do.”
3120𓀴
3121𓀴He hadn’t said any
 more, but it was
 the moment of his own intention. He
3122𓀴saw as clearly as
 the lines of the
 mosaic on the wall--the prospect of a
3123𓀴definite new life.
3124𓀴
3125𓀴This mere study of
 a delightful English
 temperament should develop into
3126𓀴the most serious
 of all his affairs.
3127𓀴
3128𓀴A girl as beautiful
 and as innocent
 with such a command of so compliant
3129𓀴a parent (for little
 homes in the country
 for sick children must involve
3130𓀴an elastic pocket
 on the part of Mr.
 Pinsent) struck Léon as a rare and
3131𓀴favorable opportunity.
3132𓀴
3133𓀴After all, he meant
 to settle down
 some day. His mother wanted it, and
3134𓀴his father’s extravagance
 had done
 much to make a good match difficult
3135𓀴in France, and Léon
 liked Rose, he
 appreciated her. She was innocent,
3136𓀴but she wasn’t eager--she made no
 advances towards him--she was modest
3137𓀴without being in any
 danger of striking
 him as a fool. She knew, for
3138𓀴instance, when to
 hold her tongue.
3139𓀴
3140𓀴She was the only
 one of the Pinsent
 family who had the good taste to
3141𓀴ignore an awkward little episode
 which took place at about this time.
3142𓀴
3143𓀴Léon had been very
 fortunate hitherto,
 he had also been skilful. Rome is
3144𓀴not a large town, nor one in
 which it is easy to keep one’s
3145𓀴acquaintances definitely apart.
3146𓀴
3147𓀴Léon was at this
 time carrying on two
 perfectly different affairs. There
3148𓀴was the Pinsent affair--which
 hadn’t
 arrived and which took up a good
3149𓀴deal of time, and
 for which he chose
 a certain type of occupation, but
3150𓀴there was another
 affair--which had
 arrived some time ago, very much
3151𓀴less serious, of course, but also
 requiring time and a background from
3152𓀴which he had so far succeeded
 in eliminating
 any appearance on the part
3153𓀴of the Pinsent family.
3154𓀴
3155𓀴Mr. Pinsent upset
 this arrangement
 by altering at the last moment, and
3156𓀴without notifying
 Léon--the program
 prepared in advance by Léon and Mrs.
3157𓀴Pinsent. Mr. Pinsent decided that
 he would go to Frascati and walk up a
3158𓀴hill to a place called
 Tusculum. There
 wasn’t much to be seen when you
3159𓀴got there--but what
 he suddenly felt
 was that he needed more exercise
3160𓀴and they could get lunch at
 the Grand Hotel coming back.
3161𓀴
3162𓀴It was at the Grand
 Hotel that the
 incident happened. Léon saw them
3163𓀴coming inexorably
 across the garden
 in close formation, waving parasols
3164𓀴and shouting their
 unfettered greetings.
3165𓀴
3166𓀴He notified the
 brilliant lady who
 was his companion that they must
3167𓀴instantly retire in
 the opposite direction.
 His companion stared, not at
3168𓀴him--a glance had
 explained him to
 her quick intelligence--but at the
3169𓀴Pinsent family. She said under
 her breath, “The English have no
3170𓀴families--they have tribes--this
 appears to be a savage one.”
3171𓀴
3172𓀴Léon never moved a muscle of his
 face--he turned his back resolutely
3173𓀴upon the approaching Pinsents,
 and took his companion into the
3174𓀴hotel--where he
 asked for a private
 room. If the Pinsents chose to
3175𓀴follow him there--it
 would be a pity--but
 everything would be at an end.
3176𓀴There are forms that must be
 preserved even in the face of
3177𓀴self-interest. Léon knew that he
 would never forgive Rose if the
3178𓀴Pinsents went any
 further. But they
 didn’t go any further--Rose diverted
3179𓀴their attention--she
 loudly declared
 that it wasn’t Léon--and insisted
3180𓀴on remaining in the
 garden. She owned
 when pressed that the walk had
3181𓀴been too much for
 her. She felt not
 exactly faint, but that she would
3182𓀴rather not go indoors.
 The Pinsents
 had their lunch under a magnolia
3183𓀴tree in the garden. It was very
 like a picnic, and Agatha and Edith
3184𓀴prepared a splendid
 method of “roasting
 Léon” when they got hold of him
3185𓀴once more. They effected
 this seizure
 in the hall of the hotel that
3186𓀴evening. They upbraided
 him roundly
 with the exception of Rose. Léon
3187𓀴denied steadily that he was ever
 at Frascati, but of course not--how
3188𓀴could he have been there and not
 rushed to greet them? It wasn’t
3189𓀴conceivable--they
 had seen his double!
 Agatha and Edith described with
3190𓀴much wealth of detail the lady he
 was with (only the English could walk
3191𓀴so merrily into
 dangerous places).
3192𓀴
3193𓀴Léon looked graver
 still. He turned
 to Rose. “And you, Mademoiselle,” he
3194𓀴asked, “were you under the
 impression that you saw me?”
3195𓀴
3196𓀴“It certainly did
 look exactly like
 you,” Mrs. Pinsent murmured, looking
3197𓀴rather troubled. “I particularly
 noticed the hat.”
3198𓀴
3199𓀴“Lots of people wear
 hats like Monsieur
 Legier,” Rose said, looking away
3200𓀴from Léon.
3201𓀴
3202𓀴She was the only one of the party
 he finally failed to convince.
3203𓀴
3204𓀴He did more than
 admire her then, he
 respected her. There is no taste so
3205𓀴perfect as that which permanently
 conceals a fact which is awkward for
3206𓀴others.
3207𓀴
3208𓀴Rose concealed it, but she paid
 for her good taste by her tears.
3209𓀴
3210𓀴
3211𓀴                  
             CHAPTER IV
3212𓀴
3213𓀴Léon planned in
 advance the setting
 for his proposal. He would make it
3214𓀴in the English way, to the girl
 herself. Léon had never proposed
3215𓀴marriage before, and he gave
 the affair his best attention.
3216𓀴
3217𓀴The Baths of Caracalla are never
 very crowded and at certain times of
3218𓀴the day they are extraordinarily
 solitary.
3219𓀴
3220𓀴Léon knew one of
 the chief excavators
 and it was part of his idea to
3221𓀴take the entire family of Pinsent
 with the exception of Rose into the
3222𓀴underground regions.
 The excavator,
 who was an enthusiast, could be
3223𓀴calculated to hold them there for
 a full hour. Rose, who never liked
3224𓀴underground temples,
 agreed easily
 enough to remain in the open air, and
3225𓀴Léon disappeared with the others.
 She was a little puzzled over
3226𓀴Baedeker’s description
 of the Baths
 of Caracalla, once she got the
3227𓀴tepidarium in her
 head she felt she
 could get on quite easily, but the
3228𓀴tepidarium eluded her. The great
 roofless, sunny space, wouldn’t
3229𓀴contract itself
 reasonably, into a
 guide book, and then she heard Léon’s
3230𓀴returning footsteps.
3231𓀴
3232𓀴“Has anything happened?”
 she asked in some alarm.
3233𓀴
3234𓀴“That is for you
 to say,” answered
 Léon with unusual gravity. “For my
3235𓀴part I have found you--and that
 for the moment is enough.”
3236𓀴
3237𓀴“Didn’t you mean to stay down
 there, then?” asked Rose in some
3238𓀴bewilderment.
3239𓀴
3240𓀴“Never in the world,”
 said Léon more
 lightly. “Am I the kind of man to
3241𓀴engage myself with the
 temple of _Mithras,
 je m’en fiche de Mithras_! I
3242𓀴beg your pardon--I
 should say, in the
 phrase of your American cousins, I
3243𓀴have no use for him!”
3244𓀴
3245𓀴There was no one
 but themselves in
 the Baths of Caracalla, the great
3246𓀴pink walls stretched
 spaciously around
 them, the blue sky benignantly
3247𓀴overhead, under foot
 the fresh spring
 grasses spread like an emerald
3248𓀴fire.
3249𓀴
3250𓀴“I suppose we ought
 to go all over
 it properly,” Rose asked a little
3251𓀴wistfully. Léon shook
 his head. “Why
 should we do that?” he objected.
3252𓀴“Let us leave propriety
 to Mithras.
 If ancient history is true, he stood
3253𓀴much in need of
 it. For ourselves,
 let us sit down in this corner--under
3254𓀴the shelter of the
 ivy--and look at
 the pink blossoms in front of us. If
3255𓀴you had not informed
 me how serious
 it is to pay compliments, I should
3256𓀴have told that tree--that it was
 very nearly as pretty as the English
3257𓀴complexion; but as
 I am a very truthful
 man and have no wish to curry
3258𓀴favor with any one, I should
 have added, not quite.”
3259𓀴
3260𓀴Rose smiled a little tremulously.
 She said nothing, but she hoped Léon
3261𓀴would go on talking.
 She turned her
 eyes on the almond tree; its pale
3262𓀴pink flowers hung above
 them like a little cloud.
3263𓀴
3264𓀴A silence fell between
 them, a significant,
 tremendous silence. Rose
3265𓀴became aware that she was alone
 with Léon in a way in which she had
3266𓀴never been alone
 with any one before.
 Their privacy was as breathless as
3267𓀴danger. In a moment
 more it seemed
 to Rose something tremendous would
3268𓀴have happened like
 an earthquake or
 a volcano, but probably much nicer
3269𓀴than these manifestations
 of nature.
3270𓀴
3271𓀴Then she knew that
 it had happened
 already. Léon had caught both her
3272𓀴hands in his. “Mademoiselle,”
 he asked
 her in a queer, strained voice,
3273𓀴“Has any man ever
 kissed you before?”
3274𓀴
3275𓀴She lifted frightened, fluttering
 eyes to his--they were wonderful in
3276𓀴their candor.
3277𓀴
3278𓀴“No!” she whispered. “No!”
3279𓀴
3280𓀴“_Alors!_ You will not be able to
 say that again!” he said firmly,
3281𓀴bending towards
 her. But though his
 eyes held hers with the intentness
3282𓀴of a hawk, he waited
 for her answering
 surrender. She startled him by
3283𓀴the urgency of her
 protest. “Oh, don’t!
 Don’t!” she pleaded. “Please let
3284𓀴me go!” Instantly
 he released her.
3285𓀴
3286𓀴“You don’t like me
 enough?” he asked
 her in surprise. “Do you think I am
3287𓀴such a brute that
 I would kiss you
 against your will? Why, never in the
3288𓀴world! That is no
 kiss, that is not
 a mutual pleasure. But why do you
3289𓀴say ‘No’ to me, Rose?--for your
 eyes--your eyes say ‘Yes’!”
3290𓀴
3291𓀴“Oh, no!” she answered quickly.
 “I know you wouldn’t do anything I
3292𓀴shouldn’t like, but don’t you see
 I can’t let you--it’s just because
3293𓀴I--I do like you
 so much.” She turned
 her face away from him, her eyes
3294𓀴filled suddenly
 with tears. “Please
 don’t say any more,” she urged. “I
3295𓀴know with you it’s
 different--please
 go away.”
3296𓀴
3297𓀴But Léon sat down
 near her. “I will
 do anything in the world you want,”
3298𓀴he said firmly, “except go away.
 After what you have said you cannot
3299𓀴expect me to do that. You must
 listen to me a little now--are you
3300𓀴listening, Rose?”
3301𓀴
3302𓀴She nodded her head.
3303𓀴
3304𓀴“I am going to say something that
 will give you pain,” Léon began
3305𓀴slowly. “I had not
 meant to say it,
 I had meant, if I were fortunate
3306𓀴enough, to give you pleasure, but
 when you say you like me you make me
3307𓀴feel that I must not be a coward.
 Rose--I am a bad man.”
3308𓀴
3309𓀴She turned startled,
 unbelieving eyes
 upon him. What he said was painful
3310𓀴to her, but she
 had been expecting
 a different kind of pain.
3311𓀴
3312𓀴“Yes,” he said gravely.
 “It is true.
 I am not in the least worth your
3313𓀴regard. I do not
 think I shall make
 a good husband even for you. I say
3314𓀴this to you because
 I am going to add
 the little thing I had hoped might
3315𓀴give you pleasure.
 _Je vous aime_,
 Mademoiselle.” The words had a
3316𓀴sharper significance
 in his own tongue.
 After he had said them he looked
3317𓀴for the first time away from her,
 towards the almond blossom tree. “You
3318𓀴are as fine, as beautiful as that
 tree,” he murmured, “and oh, my dear,
3319𓀴you know as little--as
 these frail
 pink flowers--about a man like me.
3320𓀴How can I ask you to trust me?”
3321𓀴
3322𓀴Fear crept into her
 eyes. “Léon,” she
 whispered, “what you said just now
3323𓀴was true, wasn’t it?”
3324𓀴
3325𓀴“That I am bad?”
 he asked bitterly.
 “Yes--it is true--it would be a poor
3326𓀴joke, such an assertion,
 just now,
 though perhaps it is a poorer truth.
3327𓀴It is also true that I would have
 kept it from you--if you had not
3328𓀴greatly moved me.”
3329𓀴
3330𓀴“No--I didn’t mean
 that,” she said
 gently. “I meant the other thing you
3331𓀴said.”
3332𓀴
3333𓀴He turned quickly. “That
 I love you?” he asked.
3334𓀴
3335𓀴Rose nodded. “Because,”
 she whispered,
 “I--I would take the risk--if you
3336𓀴loved me.”
3337𓀴
3338𓀴He took her hand
 and kissed it, and
 then with a fierce gentleness that
3339𓀴seemed impatient of
 its own restraint,
 he drew her into his arms and
3340𓀴pressed his lips
 to hers. “You child!
 You child!” he murmured. “God
3341𓀴punish me--if I ever fail you--”
 But even with his lips against her
3342𓀴lips--he envisaged
 his own failure.
3343𓀴
3344𓀴She drew away from
 him. “Léon,” she
 said, “I want you to let me go home
3345𓀴alone--”
3346𓀴
3347𓀴He looked at her in surprise--a
 moment before she had seemed so
3348𓀴helpless, so incapable
 of asserting
 her surrendered will, and now,
3349𓀴facing him with her
 steady eyes, she
 seemed an independent, self-reliant
3350𓀴woman. For an instant he wondered
 if he thoroughly understood her, but
3351𓀴he put this misgiving
 away from him.
3352𓀴
3353𓀴“You must do whatever you wish,
 of course,” he said gently. “But it
3354𓀴is--not that you are unhappy
 or that you are afraid?”
3355𓀴
3356𓀴She turned towards
 him fiercely. “Yes,”
 she said, “I am afraid. How can
3357𓀴any one be as happy as
 I am and not be afraid?”
3358𓀴
3359𓀴He drew a long breath,
 he had forgotten
 that this was her first love.
3360𓀴
3361𓀴They walked together
 to the gates in silence.
3362𓀴
3363𓀴Across the road
 the mortuary chapel
 opened its big iron doors to let a
3364𓀴common Roman funeral
 pass out. Rose
 shuddered, and turned wide eyes of
3365𓀴terror on Léon. “Oh!” she said,
 “How can God let anybody die!”
3366𓀴
3367𓀴He put her into a
 carriage, soothing
 her as best he could, but his own
3368𓀴hands trembled.
 He had not realized
 how serious this affair was going to
3369𓀴be.
3370𓀴
3371𓀴It was as serious as death.
3372𓀴
3373𓀴
3374𓀴                  
             CHAPTER V
3375𓀴
3376𓀴The Hotel le Roy
 became a place for
 consultations. Everybody interviewed
3377𓀴everybody else. The
 hall, the stuffy
 red salon, the tiny, damp garden,
3378𓀴even the lift became
 indispensable
 for hurried conversations, but of
3379𓀴course none of them had the least
 result. Léon, from the moment of his
3380𓀴engagement, had taken
 rooms at another
 hotel--this was at once more
3381𓀴_convenable_ and also
 much more convenient.
 His French relatives were
3382𓀴furious. He let
 them consume their
 fury among themselves, and told them
3383𓀴when he had to see them, that
 their interest in his affairs was
3384𓀴charming.
3385𓀴
3386𓀴The Pinsents were
 all trying to be
 large-minded, uninsular and modern,
3387𓀴but they didn’t like it.
3388𓀴
3389𓀴Mr. Pinsent made
 a false start. He
 told Mrs. Pinsent that the engagement
3390𓀴was out of the question.
 Mrs. Pinsent
 suggested his seeing Rose for
3391𓀴himself and talking
 it all out. Mr.
 Pinsent refused hastily, clinging to
3392𓀴the one plank of
 masculine security.
 “Aren’t you the child’s mother?” he
3393𓀴demanded. Mrs. Pinsent
 made no attempt
 to deny this salient fact. She
3394𓀴merely said, “I’m
 afraid Rose will
 say she wants to see you about it.”
3395𓀴Mr. Pinsent knew what that meant.
 If he saw Rose he was lost. But as a
3396𓀴matter of fact, he
 was lost already,
 without seeing Rose. Mrs. Pinsent
3397𓀴had lost him.
3398𓀴
3399𓀴After Mr. Pinsent had finished
 saying that the engagement was all
3400𓀴nonsense and that
 he wouldn’t hear
 of it for a moment, she said he was
3401𓀴perfectly right, but it wasn’t as
 if Léon was an Italian, was it? Paris
3402𓀴was really not at
 all far from London
 when you came to think of it, and
3403𓀴Léon was most obliging,
 and dressed
 quite like an Englishman, “and after
3404𓀴all,” she finished,
 “we haven’t anything
 against him, have we? He told
3405𓀴me himself he wasn’t
 a good Roman Catholic.”
3406𓀴
3407𓀴In the end Mr. Pinsent had to see
 Rose, and after this he agreed to a
3408𓀴further interview with Léon.
3409𓀴
3410𓀴The interview was
 not, from Léon’s
 point of view, at all what it should
3411𓀴have been.
3412𓀴
3413𓀴Mr. Pinsent had no
 sense of form. He
 hardly listened to Léon’s statement
3414𓀴of his affairs, and
 he made no statement
 at all of his own intentions.
3415𓀴He walked up and down
 the rather cold,
 deserted salon talking about Rose
3416𓀴having had pneumonia
 when she was twelve,
 and how sensitive she was, and
3417𓀴how much he would
 miss her. She was
 quite the best bridge player of the
3418𓀴three girls, and her golf
 was coming on splendidly.
3419𓀴
3420𓀴He said he thought
 Paris hardly the
 kind of place for a real home life.
3421𓀴He hadn’t seen any
 there, some years
 ago, when he and Mrs. Pinsent
3422𓀴stayed in the Rue
 de Rivoli. He added
 that he couldn’t really feel as if
3423𓀴Rose would like
 continually hearing
 French spoken all round her. It was
3424𓀴quite different from being abroad
 for a time and coming home again
3425𓀴afterwards. Mr. Pinsent laid
 his hand on Léon’s shoulder and
3426𓀴sentimentalized
 the situation in a
 way that shocked Léon’s whole nature.
3427𓀴
3428𓀴Emotion should take place (enough
 of it, for a mere betrothal) between
3429𓀴Léon and Rose; it
 shouldn’t take place
 between Rose’s father and Léon,
3430𓀴and as for talking
 about the feeling
 of a man for a good woman, nothing
3431𓀴could have been
 more out of place.
 You simply, of course, didn’t talk of
3432𓀴it. Mr. Pinsent, however, did.
3433𓀴
3434𓀴“Of course we must
 go into everything
 very carefully later on,” Mr.
3435𓀴Pinsent finished,
 rubbing the back
 of his head. “Rose seems to have set
3436𓀴her heart on you--we must all
 hope you can make her happy.”
3437𓀴
3438𓀴Then Mr. Pinsent shook hands with
 Léon and seemed to think there was
3439𓀴nothing more to be said.
3440𓀴
3441𓀴They never did go
 into anything later
 on. In the first place, Madame de
3442𓀴Brenteuil refused point blank to
 meet Mrs. Pinsent. “If,” she said to
3443𓀴Léon, “your mother sanctions your
 engagement, we have decided to permit
3444𓀴ourselves to speak
 to the girl. Her
 family we will never accept. More
3445𓀴you must not demand of us.”
3446𓀴
3447𓀴Madame Legier wrote
 two letters--one
 to Léon in which she said if he was
3448𓀴sure of getting £500 a year, and
 the girl was healthy--and agreed to
3449𓀴bring up the children
 as Catholics--she
 supposed it was better to close
3450𓀴with it, though Heaven
 knew how they
 would fit things in, the English
3451𓀴temperament being as stubborn
 as wood, and his father most
3452𓀴unaccommodating
 when he was there;
 and another letter to Rose in which
3453𓀴she welcomed her into the family
 and said what confidence she had in
3454𓀴Léon’s choice, and how she and
 her husband looked forward to the
3455𓀴brightening of their future lives
 by the sight of their children’s
3456𓀴happiness.
3457𓀴
3458𓀴Monsieur Legier wrote
 a third letter
 which Mrs. Pinsent translated to
3459𓀴her husband. He said
 something about
 a lawyer in it, but Mr. Pinsent
3460𓀴said nothing would
 induce him to see
 a French lawyer, English ones were
3461𓀴bad enough.
3462𓀴
3463𓀴Rose didn’t give anybody time to
 do much more. She announced that she
3464𓀴wanted to be married at once and
 spend her honeymoon at Capri.
3465𓀴
3466𓀴She could buy what
 she needed in Rome
 and finish getting her trousseau
3467𓀴together in Paris.
3468𓀴
3469𓀴She had set her heart on going to
 Capri for her honeymoon and there
3470𓀴wasn’t any use anybody
 saying anything.
3471𓀴
3472𓀴She didn’t even
 pay much attention
 to Léon, who ventured on one occasion
3473𓀴to wonder if Capri was very gay?
3474𓀴
3475𓀴“We sha’n’t want to be gay,” Rose
 said a little soberly. “We shall just
3476𓀴be perfectly happy.”
3477𓀴
3478𓀴Léon said no more.
 Of course he expected
 to be happy, but he had never
3479𓀴in his life been happy when
 he wasn’t a little gay.
3480𓀴
3481𓀴Rose saw very little
 of Léon during
 their brief engagement. They were
3482𓀴both immersed in preparations for
 the wedding, but the little she saw
3483𓀴was like the vision
 of a Fairy Prince.
3484𓀴
3485𓀴He was gallant, delicate
 and intent.
 Nothing about Rose escaped him. He
3486𓀴knew with a marvelous
 tact from moment
 to moment what would please her
3487𓀴best.
3488𓀴
3489𓀴It was (but of course Rose didn’t
 know this) the correct attitude for a
3490𓀴Frenchman engaged to be married.
3491𓀴
3492𓀴As the marriage approached, Mrs.
 Pinsent had moments of secret doubt.
3493𓀴She knew it was
 very silly of her,
 but Rose was her youngest child, and
3494𓀴marriage by two consuls
 and a Cardinal
 wasn’t at all like being married
3495𓀴properly in your
 own church at home.
3496𓀴
3497𓀴She went so far one evening as to
 go into Rose’s bedroom under the
3498𓀴pretext of borrowing
 her hairbrush,
 just to see if her child was quite
3499𓀴happy. Mrs. Pinsent’s
 hair was long
 and thick like Rose’s, it had been
3500𓀴the same color when
 she was Rose’s
 age. She sat in an armchair by the
3501𓀴bed and thought that Rose, whose
 hair was done in two long plaits,
3502𓀴looked terribly like she used to
 look when she was ten years old.
3503𓀴
3504𓀴“My dear,” she said, “I like Léon
 so much.” Rose smiled and blushed and
3505𓀴snuggled further
 into the rather hard
 second pillow reluctantly conceded
3506𓀴to her by the Hotel le Roy.
3507𓀴
3508𓀴“Yes, Mamma, I know,” she said,
 “and he loves you--isn’t it nice?”
3509𓀴
3510𓀴Mrs. Pinsent reflected.
 “All the same,”
 she said, “men are very strange.
3511𓀴I mean even our own
 men. You’d think
 you could tell what they’re like
3512𓀴before you are married
 to them, but
 you can’t--you don’t even know for
3513𓀴quite a long time afterwards.”
3514𓀴
3515𓀴Rose looked unconcerned. “It’s so
 funny,” she said, “but I feel as if I
3516𓀴knew Léon better than if he was
 an Englishman. You see, he tells me
3517𓀴more. I can’t quite
 put it to you,
 so that you can understand, but I
3518𓀴think it’s his being so
 much more expressive.”
3519𓀴
3520𓀴“Yes,” said Mrs. Pinsent. “Only
 that isn’t what I mean, you know. I
3521𓀴wasn’t thinking
 of what they said,
 any of them. I don’t think you can go
3522𓀴by that; when they’re in
 love, they’ll say anything.”
3523𓀴
3524𓀴Rose hesitated. “But, Mamma,” she
 said, “don’t men--don’t they _ever_
3525𓀴stay in love?”
3526𓀴
3527𓀴Mrs. Pinsent resorted
 hastily to the
 hairbrush. Almost all married women
3528𓀴dislike this question.
3529𓀴
3530𓀴“Of course, in a sense,”
 she admitted.
 “But when they get used to you
3531𓀴they aren’t always
 very easy to hold.”
3532𓀴
3533𓀴Rose sat up very
 straight and slim.
 “How do you mean--_hold_?” she asked
3534𓀴quickly. Mrs. Pinsent brushed her
 hair well over her face. She hoped
3535𓀴Rose wasn’t thinking
 about her father.
 It was an unnecessary fear, Rose
3536𓀴wasn’t thinking about
 any one but Léon.
3537𓀴
3538𓀴“Well,” Mrs. Pinsent
 explained, “I
 think there comes a time in almost
3539𓀴all happy marriages
 when a man has
 almost too much of what he wants. He
3540𓀴gets, if one isn’t
 very careful, and
 perhaps even if one is--a little--a
3541𓀴little restive and
 bored. You see,
 men never have as much to amuse
3542𓀴themselves with
 as women have--and
 that makes them take more interest in
3543𓀴what they _do_ like
 even if it isn’t
 good for them--and other women
3544𓀴(whom they wouldn’t
 really care for
 a bit--if they saw enough of them)
3545𓀴may make an appeal
 to them just because
 they’re _not_ their wives. Of
3546𓀴course, it mayn’t
 be at all like this
 with Léon, dear, only you’re going
3547𓀴so far away from us--and
 he’s a Frenchman,
 and perhaps they don’t think
3548𓀴of marriage quite
 as we do. I have
 never read Zola, of course, but I
3549𓀴believe there is
 rather a difference
 in the point of view.” Mrs. Pinsent
3550𓀴faltered--she felt
 through the cascade
 of her hair--Rose’s inflexible
3551𓀴eyes.
3552𓀴
3553𓀴“What would you do,
 Mamma,” Rose asked
 quietly, “if anything--happened
3554𓀴like that?”
3555𓀴
3556𓀴Mrs. Pinsent drew
 a long breath. For
 a moment she was almost sorry that
3557𓀴Bernard Shaw hadn’t had a sharper
 effect upon her daughter’s
3558𓀴imagination. Mrs. Pinsent
 wasn’t anxious
 to explain what she would do.
3559𓀴She only wanted
 to be vague, and at
 the same time helpful; her own case
3560𓀴had been quite different,
 there had
 been the children, and, besides, Mr.
3561𓀴Pinsent wasn’t French.
3562𓀴
3563𓀴“We rather thought,”
 she said, “of
 staying on for some time in Rome, and
3564𓀴then going to Paris
 for the first part
 of the summer. We should be quite
3565𓀴near you then--and Agatha could
 go back to England for her tennis.”
3566𓀴
3567𓀴“I couldn’t ever
 leave Léon,” Rose
 said strangely, “whatever happened.”
3568𓀴
3569𓀴“No, dear, of course not,” said
 Mrs. Pinsent soothingly, then she
3570𓀴started quite afresh and
 began plaiting her hair.
3571𓀴
3572𓀴“Your father wanted
 me to tell you,”
 she said, “that he’s going to have
3573𓀴your allowance settled
 upon you--and
 upon your children--that’s £500 a
3574𓀴year, and later
 on you’ll have even
 more, of course, like your sisters,
3575𓀴but the money is
 in an English bank,
 and it is quite your own, but
3576𓀴you’re to have trustees
 as well, your
 father has seen to all that. Léon
3577𓀴was so nice about it. I knew he
 would be. He’s been so generous and
3578𓀴charming and most
 thoughtful.” Mrs.
 Pinsent got up and bent over her
3579𓀴daughter. “You are happy, Rose?”
 she whispered. “You do feel safe?”
3580𓀴
3581𓀴Rose lifted her undeterred,
 terribly
 triumphant eyes to her mother’s. “I
3582𓀴feel as safe,” she said,
 “as if an angel loved me.”
3583𓀴
3584𓀴
3585𓀴                  
             CHAPTER VI
3586𓀴
3587𓀴Everything had been
 done, the last
 trunk was packed, the last joke, not
3588𓀴a very good one, accomplished by
 Agatha. The two elder sisters, tired
3589𓀴out and unequal to their natural
 play of spirits, had gone to bed.
3590𓀴
3591𓀴Rose flew downstairs
 to the telephone.
 The Swiss manageress, a
3592𓀴sharp-tongued, good-hearted
 woman,
 rose wearily and shouted through the
3593𓀴receiver. After
 a violent exchange
 of reproaches with an irate porter at
3594𓀴the other end, she
 accomplished the
 feat of getting hold of Léon, and
3595𓀴put the receiver into
 the girl’s hand.
 “He is there, Mademoiselle,” she
3596𓀴said with a curious glance
 at the girl’s flushed face.
3597𓀴
3598𓀴“Oh, thank you,” Rose murmured.
 “Léon, Léon, are you there?”
3599𓀴
3600𓀴“But it is Rose?”
 His voice answered
 a little as if he was surprised
3601𓀴that it was Rose.
3602𓀴
3603𓀴“Yes,” she said quickly, “I want
 to see you. Can you come at once?”
3604𓀴
3605𓀴“Something has happened?”
 he asked
 anxiously. “Something has gone
3606𓀴wrong?”
3607𓀴
3608𓀴Rose reassured him.
 “Oh, no--nothing,
 but I felt suddenly as if I _must_
3609𓀴see you.”
3610𓀴
3611𓀴There was a moment’s
 pause, a buzzing
 sound came across the wires, and
3612𓀴then Rose heard
 a strange voice--it
 sounded like a woman’s saying very
3613𓀴slowly, “_Mais--c’est la dernière
 nuit?_” And then Léon’s again, “I am
3614𓀴very busy to-night,
 Rose--this that
 you want to see me about, is it
3615𓀴important?”
3616𓀴
3617𓀴She was surprised
 at his hesitation,
 and surprised at her own
3618𓀴insistence. It seemed
 to her suddenly
 very important that she should
3619𓀴insist. “Please,
 please come,” she
 said urgently. There was another
3620𓀴pause, then Léon said
 again, “Is it a command?”
3621𓀴
3622𓀴A moment earlier
 she would not have
 said that it was a command, but her
3623𓀴wish to see him had
 been mysteriously
 sharpened into a strange
3624𓀴imperative instinct.
3625𓀴
3626𓀴“Isn’t my wish a
 command?” she asked,
 trying to laugh. But Léon did not
3627𓀴echo her laughter. “Very well,
 then,” he said, “in ten minutes.”
3628𓀴
3629𓀴The big red salon
 was empty. For the
 first time Rose noticed the yellow
3630𓀴lamp, the blue velvet tablecloth,
 the enormous imperishable roses in
3631𓀴bulging angular vases under
 the great gilt mirror.
3632𓀴
3633𓀴She had been so happy all these
 weeks she hadn’t really seen what
3634𓀴anything was like,
 and she had hardly
 ever been alone for ten minutes.
3635𓀴Now she was alone.
 She remembered with
 a little smile that Léon had once
3636𓀴said of the salon that as an
 interior it was not seductive.
3637𓀴
3638𓀴The Pinsents did
 not use irony, but
 Rose thought she rather liked it. In
3639𓀴ten minutes precisely
 Léon was with
 her. Fortunately Madame de Brenteuil
3640𓀴had gone to bed.
3641𓀴
3642𓀴Léon entered quickly,
 looking about
 him as if he had expected one or
3643𓀴more of the Pinsent family to be
 in attendance. Only Rose, feeling
3644𓀴suddenly rather
 small and very far
 away, stood under an imitation palm
3645𓀴close by the mantelpiece.
3646𓀴
3647𓀴Léon took her hands, kissed them,
 pressing them, and letting them go in
3648𓀴one quick movement.
3649𓀴
3650𓀴“I am here,” he said,
 drawing a seat
 up close to her. “Well--what is
3651𓀴this thing that
 has suddenly become
 necessary for us to talk about?”
3652𓀴
3653𓀴Rose looked at him questioningly.
 Really she hardly knew what it was
3654𓀴that she wanted to
 see him for, perhaps
 it was after all only to see
3655𓀴him! To count over her riches, to
 feel the wonderful golden coins slip
3656𓀴through her eager
 fingers. Only now
 as she met his eyes it seemed to her
3657𓀴that he shut her out.
 He had a strange
 hard look, and though he smiled,
3658𓀴his smile itself
 had a new quality,
 a quality which seemed to put her a
3659𓀴little to one side.
 “I don’t quite
 know, Léon,” she murmured. “I did
3660𓀴want to see you--but I think
 I must have had some reason.”
3661𓀴
3662𓀴Léon glanced through
 the glass door
 of the salon at the back of the
3663𓀴Manageress’ head.
 “Let us hope so,”
 he said cheerfully, “for it is ten
3664𓀴o’clock and I see no one here
 but Madame at the Bureau.”
3665𓀴
3666𓀴“Father was here--but
 I sent him away,”
 Rose explained conscientiously.
3667𓀴
3668𓀴Léon gave an odd little laugh.
 “To-night,” he said, “you are very
3669𓀴imperative. But you see we are
 all your slaves. He went--I
3670𓀴came--well--what
 do you wish of us?”
3671𓀴
3672𓀴“Léon,” she whispered,
 frightened by
 the coldness of his voice, “weren’t
3673𓀴you glad to come?”
3674𓀴
3675𓀴He gave himself
 a tiny shake as if
 he were trying to pull himself into a
3676𓀴fresh frame of mind.
3677𓀴
3678𓀴“But of course,”
 he said, “you are
 adorable.” To a critical ear his tone
3679𓀴lacked conviction, but Rose’s ear
 was not critical; that is to say, not
3680𓀴yet. She gave a little
 sigh of relief.
3681𓀴
3682𓀴“I think I know
 what it was I meant
 to say,” she stated, “Mamma has been
3683𓀴talking to me about marriage.”
3684𓀴
3685𓀴“Ah--!” said Léon quickly.
3686𓀴
3687𓀴“Something she said,”
 Rose continued,
 “made me wonder. You see, I had
3688𓀴always supposed when you were in
 love--that was enough. But what she
3689𓀴said made me wonder if perhaps it
 didn’t matter a good deal _how_?”
3690𓀴
3691𓀴Léon looked a trifle puzzled, but
 he was also amused, his hardness was
3692𓀴beginning to melt under the spell
 of her wistful loveliness;
3693𓀴something--some other spell,
 perhaps, receded from him.
3694𓀴
3695𓀴“_Bien sur_,” he
 murmured, looking
 into her eyes. “It matters how one
3696𓀴loves.”
3697𓀴
3698𓀴“And I couldn’t help
 thinking,” Rose
 went on with gathering confidence,
3699𓀴“that you knew rather
 more about it than I do.”
3700𓀴
3701𓀴Léon’s eyes flickered
 under the yellow
 lamps. It was almost as if they
3702𓀴were laughing at her.
3703𓀴
3704𓀴“Yes,” he said caressingly,
 “yes--that is always possible.”
3705𓀴
3706𓀴“You see,” Rose explained,
 “all along
 I have felt as if you knew me, and
3707𓀴what I wanted, and how you could
 please me, so astonishingly well.”
3708𓀴
3709𓀴Léon smiled. He did not tell her
 that compared to other women--many
3710𓀴other women--she
 was easy to please.
3711𓀴
3712𓀴“Of course,” Rose went on, “in a
 way I understand you. I told Mamma
3713𓀴that! Better than
 if you were English,
 because we’ve talked so much, you
3714𓀴see--but I’m not sure--not quite
 sure--that I know all the things you
3715𓀴don’t like.
3716𓀴
3717𓀴“What I wanted to
 ask you to-night
 was--will you always tell me what you
3718𓀴want and not mind
 if I’m stupid and
 don’t know things until you tell me?
3719𓀴You need never tell me more than
 once--I shall always remember.”
3720𓀴
3721𓀴She had touched him
 now, touched him
 so much that he sprang to his feet
3722𓀴and walked hastily
 to the window. She
 could not see his face. She waited
3723𓀴patiently and a little
 anxiously for
 him to come back to her. He said,
3724𓀴when he came back, and
 stood behind her chair:
3725𓀴
3726𓀴“You are adorable,”
 but he said it
 quite differently, he said it as if
3727𓀴he really found her
 adorable. “It is
 true,” he said at last, very gently
3728𓀴and tenderly. “There are things
 that we must teach each other, and
3729𓀴to-night I will teach
 you one of them.
 You should not have sent for me
3730𓀴here.”
3731𓀴
3732𓀴“Ah, but why, Léon?”
 she cried. “It
 was just the last night”--her voice
3733𓀴faltered--some queer little trick
 of the brain forced into her memory
3734𓀴the voice she had heard
 on the telephone.
 That woman, too, had said to
3735𓀴somebody that it
 was the last night.
3736𓀴
3737𓀴“In the first place,”
 he said, still
 gently, but a little gravely, “you
3738𓀴should not have
 seen me at all--on
 the evening before our marriage, it
3739𓀴is the reason itself! You should
 have spent it with your mother and
3740𓀴sisters. It surprised
 me--it surprised
 me very much--your sending for
3741𓀴me.”
3742𓀴
3743𓀴She flushed crimson.
 “Do not think
 I blame you,” he said quickly. “But I
3744𓀴am a Frenchman,
 and you must learn
 a little how we think.” Rose bowed
3745𓀴her head. “And in
 the second place,”
 he said, “my very dear child--you
3746𓀴must not constrain me to come to
 you--it is my delight--my joy to be
3747𓀴with you--be very
 careful that you
 never make it my duty! I am your
3748𓀴lover--to-morrow I shall be your
 husband. So--so you will remember,
3749𓀴never try to constrain
 me to be with
 you--let me come, let me go, do not
3750𓀴try to hold me, and do not seek
 to know where I have been.”
3751𓀴
3752𓀴“But,” she cried
 eagerly, “Léon--I
 didn’t mean to do anything like that!
3753𓀴I--I was frightened.
 I wanted you!
 Just to see you! I never will
3754𓀴again--I mean--I don’t
 think--do you?--I
 shall ever be frightened again.
3755𓀴It wasn’t that I
 meant to--oh, what
 a horrible word--constrain you--only
3756𓀴I thought you would be alone
 and wanting me, too!”
3757𓀴
3758𓀴“Mon Dieu!” he cried, with sudden
 exasperation. “Of course I want you!”
3759𓀴
3760𓀴She drew back a little
 from the savage
 light in his eyes--he had caught
3761𓀴her arm suddenly and roughly--but
 in an instant he had himself in hand.
3762𓀴“Now I am going,”
 he said. “You are
 not to be frightened any more. You
3763𓀴are mine, my sweetheart, my wife,
 my darling! How I love the pretty
3764𓀴English words!--and you will love
 a little your funny French husband,
3765𓀴will you not?--and
 forgive him, if
 you do not always understand him.”
3766𓀴
3767𓀴He took her very
 gently in his arms,
 and kissed her troubled eyes and
3768𓀴put his lips lingeringly
 and tenderly
 to hers. There were tears on her
3769𓀴eyelashes, but she smiled bravely
 up at him. “I will never forget what
3770𓀴you have said,” she murmured,
 “and I will love you always.”
3771𓀴
3772𓀴Then he went away.
 After he had gone,
 it occurred to Rose that she was
3773𓀴to belong to him,
 but if they were
 to be happy he must not belong to
3774𓀴her. She did not put it quite as
 sharply as this, but she reminded
3775𓀴herself that the great thing was
 for Léon never to feel bound.
3776𓀴
3777𓀴Madame came in from
 the bureau to put
 out the lights. “You will not need
3778𓀴them any more, Mademoiselle,” she
 asked, “now that Monsieur has gone?”
3779𓀴
3780𓀴“No,” said Rose. “Thank you very
 much. Madame, are you French?”
3781𓀴
3782𓀴“No, Mademoiselle,”
 the Manageress
 replied. “I am a Swiss from Basle.”
3783𓀴
3784𓀴“But you know French
 people?” Rose insisted.
3785𓀴
3786𓀴Madame shrugged her
 shoulders. “I know
 most people,” she observed. “Even
3787𓀴Arabs, I once kept
 a hotel in Egypt;
 but why do you ask, Mademoiselle?”
3788𓀴
3789𓀴“I wondered,” Rose
 said, “if you thought
 them--the French, I mean--very
3790𓀴difficult to please?”
3791𓀴
3792𓀴“No people are easy
 to please,” Madame
 replied, putting out the lights
3793𓀴with a sharp twist,
 as if she disliked
 them. “And all are unpleasant
3794𓀴when they are not
 pleased. I do not
 say the French are more unpleasant
3795𓀴than the others.
 They know what they
 are about and they don’t ask for
3796𓀴the moon and expect to get it for
 two sous, but what they ask for--that
3797𓀴they do expect to
 get no matter what
 it costs others that they should
3798𓀴have it. In general,
 I find the French
 have very little heart. I have no
3799𓀴complaint to make against them.
 They are orderly, they do not waste
3800𓀴time, they have
 the sense of how to
 behave. But I find it is better to
3801𓀴expect nothing from
 them, and to remain
 independent. Is there anything
3802𓀴further you require,
 Mademoiselle?”
3803𓀴
3804𓀴Rose thanked her again and turned
 thoughtfully away. Madame, with the
3805𓀴last switch in her
 hand, looked curiously
 after her. “The English,” she
3806𓀴said to herself,
 “are not practical.
 Nevertheless, Madame de Brenteuil
3807𓀴is quite wrong about
 them. They mean
 no harm. The whole family Pinsent
3808𓀴walks about with
 its eyes shut, as
 innocent as the newly baptized. They
3809𓀴are a race of mystics
 without manners.
 It is what comes of a meat
3810𓀴breakfast so early
 in the morning.
 The senses become clogged. I must not
3811𓀴forget to remind Alfonso that the
 father Pinsent wants bacon with his
3812𓀴eggs.”
3813𓀴
3814𓀴
3815𓀴                  
            CHAPTER VII
3816𓀴
3817𓀴They had been married a week--a
 tremulous, ecstatic, amazing week.
3818𓀴
3819𓀴It seemed to Rose made up of all
 the laughing colors of the sea.
3820𓀴
3821𓀴They were surrounded
 by the sea, clear
 and limpid as a shallow pool, the
3822𓀴great deep bay gleamed
 and shone about them.
3823𓀴
3824𓀴Out of it the Islands
 rose like flowers.
 Capri uneven, wild and blue,
3825𓀴Ischia tulip-shaped
 and tall--Posilippo
 and its attendant isles like a
3826𓀴fallen spray of blossoms;
 and in Capri
 itself the whole spring lay bare
3827𓀴to the sun.
3828𓀴
3829𓀴The South was like Léon--it was
 beautiful, but it was strange.
3830𓀴
3831𓀴On their first evening
 they had driven
 swiftly up the hillside; the air
3832𓀴was cold and keen;
 the small mountain
 ponies galloped through the
3833𓀴quick-falling darkness
 and just for
 a moment a breath of fear touched
3834𓀴the triumphant bride.
3835𓀴
3836𓀴She longed for something
 familiar,
 something that wasn’t even beautiful,
3837𓀴but to which she had
 grown accustomed.
 She didn’t put it to herself
3838𓀴quite like that--she
 only wished she
 hadn’t had to leave her fox terrier
3839𓀴at home.
3840𓀴
3841𓀴The moment passed and other
 richer moments took its place.
3842𓀴
3843𓀴Love was just--what
 without expecting
 it Rose had most desired. No one
3844𓀴could have expected any one to be
 as wonderful as Léon. He spilt his
3845𓀴soul into his passion,
 his ardor filled
 their hours, there was no way in
3846𓀴which he did not
 color her life. She
 felt herself like some poor common
3847𓀴pebble transformed
 into purple and
 rose color by the touch of the sea.
3848𓀴
3849𓀴It never occurred
 to her that when
 the tide recedes the color goes. She
3850𓀴did not know that Léon’s passion
 was a tide, and she did not believe
3851𓀴that it would ever recede.
3852𓀴
3853𓀴They explored everything
 in Capri,
 the ruins of Tiberius’ villas, the
3854𓀴many colored grottos,
 the little stray
 paths that led between high walls
3855𓀴to the heights of
 Capri--and everything
 they saw Rose loved. But best of
3856𓀴all she loved their own familiar
 garden of the Hotel Paradiso,
3857𓀴surrounded by violets, where Léon
 taught her to smoke cigarettes and
3858𓀴where the stars swooped down on
 them in the velvet dark evenings,
3859𓀴leaning just over the tops
 of the little stunted trees.
3860𓀴
3861𓀴She had everything
 she wanted then,
 but most of all she had Léon, rarer
3862𓀴and sweeter than
 the voilets, more
 astonishing and limitless than the
3863𓀴southern stars.
3864𓀴
3865𓀴Of course he had his faults. Rose
 accepted these limits of natural
3866𓀴frailty with eager tenderness.
3867𓀴
3868𓀴He was jealous,
 fierce and a little
 hard on anything that interfered
3869𓀴with his crowning
 absorption. Rose
 had heard him speak with cold,
3870𓀴incisive sharpness to a waiter
 who interrupted one of their soft,
3871𓀴interminable garden intimacies;
 and Léon was indifferent, intensely
3872𓀴indifferent--to anything
 or any one but her.
3873𓀴
3874𓀴She couldn’t be said to mind it,
 but she noticed it; it made her hope
3875𓀴that nothing would ever happen
 to her--it would be so awful if it
3876𓀴did--for Léon.
3877𓀴
3878𓀴Then one day he
 ran up the outside
 staircase which led to their rooms
3879𓀴with a peculiar,
 excited expression
 in his eyes. Rose came out to meet
3880𓀴him, and together they
 leaned over the balcony.
3881𓀴
3882𓀴“Such a funny thing
 has happened,”
 he explained. “I’ve met an old
3883𓀴friend, isn’t it
 strange?--he is here
 also on his honeymoon. The wife--I
3884𓀴had not met before--you must know
 them. I have asked them to-morrow to
3885𓀴tea.”
3886𓀴
3887𓀴Rose hid a moment’s
 dissatisfaction.
 “Are they French, Léon?” she asked
3888𓀴a little nervously.
3889𓀴
3890𓀴“But of course, yes, Parisians of
 the most Parisian. Do you object to
3891𓀴that?” he demanded impatiently.
3892𓀴
3893𓀴“Oh no!” she explained.
 “Only you know,
 Léon dear, my French is so bad!”
3894𓀴
3895𓀴He didn’t say it
 was adorable, which
 was what he usually said, though he
3896𓀴never allowed her
 to attempt it when
 they were together. “It is time you
3897𓀴learned French,”
 he said. “You can’t
 go on like this.” Then he looked at
3898𓀴her with strange
 critical eyes. “You
 mustn’t wear that to-morrow,” he
3899𓀴said coldly. “What have you
 got that you can wear? Madame
3900𓀴Gérard--dresses.”
3901𓀴
3902𓀴Rose flushed. “Dearest,”
 she answered,
 “you know everything I’ve got--I
3903𓀴thought you liked
 my clothes--they
 were all I could get in Rome.”
3904𓀴
3905𓀴“They are, nevertheless,
 extremely
 poor,” Léon pronounced with an air of
3906𓀴finality. “I can’t think why you
 have no manner of putting on your
3907𓀴clothes. There is
 no character in them,
 no charm, no unexpectedness. You
3908𓀴dress as if you
 wanted shelter from
 the cold. Also none of your things
3909𓀴have any seduction--they
 are as dull
 as boiled eggs. You cannot live in
3910𓀴Paris and dress like an
 English country miss.”
3911𓀴
3912𓀴Rose felt as if she
 would die if Léon
 would not get that cold look out
3913𓀴of his eyes. She
 lost her head under
 his impassive scrutiny. “Must I
3914𓀴meet them?” she pleaded.
 “The Gérards,
 I mean. They don’t sound a bit my
3915𓀴kind of people.”
3916𓀴
3917𓀴“But of course you
 must meet them!”
 said Léon angrily. “Naturally, since
3918𓀴you are my wife--you
 are not my mistress,
 to be hidden away at such a
3919𓀴time!”
3920𓀴
3921𓀴“Léon!” Rose exclaimed--his words
 struck at her like a whip lash. She
3922𓀴turned quickly away and went into
 their room. She felt as if she could
3923𓀴not stay any longer with Léon. In
 five minutes he rejoined her--not the
3924𓀴strange, disagreeable man who had
 spoken to her like that, but her
3925𓀴husband Léon. He
 was full of tender
 apologies. He couldn’t, he
3926𓀴explained, think
 what had made him
 so nervous. Perhaps it was because
3927𓀴Capri was so quiet,
 one resented anything
 that broke into it. But, after
3928𓀴all after to-morrow they need see
 very little of the Gérards--Raoul
3929𓀴wasn’t a great friend of his--he
 was, however, an interesting man--a
3930𓀴well-known and very
 fine singer. He
 was a good deal thought of in Paris.
3931𓀴Perhaps one day he would sing to
 them. Madame also was musical. She
3932𓀴adored her husband’s voice.
3933𓀴
3934𓀴Rose said that would
 be lovely, and
 she asked Léon how long the Gérards’
3935𓀴honeymoon had lasted.
 Léon said longer
 than theirs--a fortnight or three
3936𓀴weeks, perhaps.
3937𓀴
3938𓀴It was Madame’s idea, Capri. They
 had taken a villa so that Raoul could
3939𓀴practise comfortably. Raoul would
 naturally have preferred Naples. “She
3940𓀴is romantic, however, like you,”
 Léon murmured, kissing Rose’s soft
3941𓀴white throat.
3942𓀴
3943𓀴Then he sighed a little and moved
 restlessly about the room. “For
3944𓀴Raoul,” he murmured, “I am not so
 sure. Capri isn’t very gay.” This was
3945𓀴the second time
 Léon had mentioned
 the lack of this quality in Capri,
3946𓀴and neither time had Rose paid
 any attention to it. She was not a
3947𓀴Frenchwoman, and she had no idea
 that Léon attached any particular
3948𓀴weight to the idea of gaiety.
3949𓀴
3950𓀴Léon kissed her again. This time
 he did it a little remorsefully.
3951𓀴
3952𓀴They were to have
 tea in the garden
 under the almond blossom trees. Léon
3953𓀴was to go into Capri
 and return early
 with cakes and roses, but before
3954𓀴he went he inspected
 Rose’s dressing
 table. He frowned helplessly at her
3955𓀴dreadful lack of accessories.
3956𓀴
3957𓀴“Before she goes,”
 he explained to
 Rose, “Madame will no doubt wish to
3958𓀴tidy her hair and
 readjust her veil.
 Why is it you have nothing here?”
3959𓀴
3960𓀴Rose gazed at him. “But, Léon,”
 she said gently, “I have pins and
3961𓀴brushes.”
3962𓀴
3963𓀴Léon exploded suddenly
 into one of
 his picturesque whiffs of anger. “Mon
3964𓀴Dieu! Are you a woman at all?” he
 exclaimed. “You have no powder, no
3965𓀴rouge, no scent. You have nothing
 here on your dressing table that a
3966𓀴woman should have!
 Oh, you everlasting
 creature of soap and fresh air!
3967𓀴How can I explain you? How can I
 explain anything? I shall go mad!”
3968𓀴
3969𓀴Afterwards he calmed
 down. He would,
 he explained, buy what he could get
3970𓀴at Capri. Fortunately
 Rose did have
 silver-topped boxes and bottles;
3971𓀴these could be filled to
 look as natural as possible.
3972𓀴
3973𓀴Rose agreed; she
 would have agreed
 to anything to please him, but she
3974𓀴was surprised at
 the amount of things
 Léon apparently considered a
3975𓀴Frenchwoman would
 find necessary in
 order to reassume her veil and tidy
3976𓀴her hair after a
 tea-party. Besides,
 Rose didn’t like scent.
3977𓀴
3978𓀴At half-past four Madame
 Gérard appeared,
 her husband strolling a little
3979𓀴behind her.
3980𓀴
3981𓀴Two impressions flashed
 simultaneously
 upon Rose; one was that Madame
3982𓀴Gérard, though distinctly smart,
 wasn’t particularly pretty, and the
3983𓀴other, that in spite
 of her lovely
 clothes, her new husband, and the
3984𓀴romance of Capri, she
 hadn’t got happy eyes.
3985𓀴
3986𓀴Her other impressions of Madame
 Gérard she formed more slowly.
3987𓀴
3988𓀴Monsieur Gérard she instantly
 and wholly disliked.
3989𓀴
3990𓀴He was much older than his wife,
 and had a bored, conceited air, and
3991𓀴rather thick red lips.
3992𓀴
3993𓀴He stared a great
 deal at Rose, and
 said several times over, when Léon
3994𓀴introduced him to her, that
 he was very much impressed.
3995𓀴
3996𓀴Madame was charming;
 she was charming
 about the garden, about the tea,
3997𓀴about the wonderful
 English nation,
 and about Capri; but she was
3998𓀴charming in Parisian
 French. Neither
 of the Gérards knew a word of
3999𓀴English, and Madame
 spoke in a cascade
 of little soft, vanishing sounds,
4000𓀴the significance of
 which poor nervous,
 attentive Rose couldn’t possibly
4001𓀴catch.
4002𓀴
4003𓀴Monsieur Gérard,
 on the other hand,
 made three separate emphatic
4004𓀴attempts to talk to
 Rose. Rose blushed
 and frowned and didn’t suppose
4005𓀴for a single instant that she had
 understood what he said. She wouldn’t
4006𓀴have liked it at all if she had,
 but of course men couldn’t say such
4007𓀴things to ladies to whom they
 had just been introduced.
4008𓀴
4009𓀴What was strange
 was that she could,
 she always bewilderingly had been
4010𓀴able to understand Léon’s French,
 however fast or complicated the rush
4011𓀴of his talk might be, and what
 was so odd, so uncomfortable and
4012𓀴bewildering was that
 Léon was saying
 really dreadful things to Madame
4013𓀴Gérard. Not that Madame Gérard
 minded, on the contrary she seemed
4014𓀴particularly stimulated by Léon’s
 vivid attentions. Nor that Monsieur
4015𓀴Gérard minded, either;
 he gave up his
 endeavors with Rose, and seemed to
4016𓀴resign himself to a
 silent but perfectly
 good-tempered peace. He seemed,
4017𓀴though the idea
 was as preposterous
 as everything else, to feel like a
4018𓀴sentry who has just been relieved
 after a too protracted exposure at a
4019𓀴difficult post. He ate heartily,
 and when he had finished he asked
4020𓀴permission to smoke,
 once or twice
 he hummed something under his breath.
4021𓀴
4022𓀴It was perfectly
 natural that Léon
 should not notice Rose, you can’t in
4023𓀴public single out your
 wife for attention,
 and Madame Gérard made the
4024𓀴most valiant efforts
 to include her.
4025𓀴
4026𓀴Expressive, gesticulating,
 infinitely
 gay, Madame drew, or strove to
4027𓀴draw, the poor dull
 little English
 wife into the swift current of their
4028𓀴talk, but she did
 not succeed, partly,
 no doubt, because Rose was shy,
4029𓀴but partly also because Léon
 markedly wished to keep her out.
4030𓀴
4031𓀴Rose kept out. She
 made herself as
 busy as she could pouring out tea and
4032𓀴handing cake, then
 she leaned back
 in her chair and tried to look as if
4033𓀴she enjoyed hearing Léon
 and Madame--what?--you
 couldn’t call it exactly
4034𓀴talk.
4035𓀴
4036𓀴That was the difficulty.
 It was more
 of a game than a conversation, and
4037𓀴a game whose rules
 Rose had never learnt.
4038𓀴
4039𓀴Monsieur Gérard got
 up after a time,
 and asked if Madame would excuse
4040𓀴him--might he examine
 the planting
 of the lemons? He was madly
4041𓀴interested in lemons.
4042𓀴
4043𓀴Rose gladly excused
 him. She heard
 Léon ask Madame Gérard if this
4044𓀴statement of her
 husband’s was true.
4045𓀴
4046𓀴“Never in the world!”
 Madame gaily
 replied. “He does not know the
4047𓀴difference between a
 lemon and an orange!”
4048𓀴
4049𓀴“Then let us,” said Léon, “also
 go and examine something we do not
4050𓀴understand.”
4051𓀴
4052𓀴Rose stayed where
 she was. Something
 had happened to her little secret
4053𓀴lovely garden, it was suddenly
 vulgarized and spoilt.
4054𓀴
4055𓀴The scent of the lemons, delicate
 and pungent, made her head ache. The
4056𓀴pigeons came to her,
 when the others
 had gone, and she fed them from the
4057𓀴crumbs of her first party. She
 had always thought it would be so
4058𓀴delightful to give
 a party with Léon,
 but she had not supposed that the
4059𓀴party, as far as
 she was concerned,
 would be composed exclusively of
4060𓀴pigeons.
4061𓀴
4062𓀴
4063𓀴                   
           CHAPTER VIII
4064𓀴
4065𓀴An affair of importance
 had brought
 Monsieur Gérard to the Hotel
4066𓀴Paradiso. He excused
 himself to Rose
 for wishing to consult her husband
4067𓀴privately. Rose accepted
 his excuses
 sedately and retired to her
4068𓀴balcony.
4069𓀴
4070𓀴She liked Léon to
 be consulted. It
 showed how wise he was, that an older
4071𓀴man, even if he wasn’t very nice,
 should stand in need of his judgment.
4072𓀴
4073𓀴It was very interesting to watch
 the two men walking up and down the
4074𓀴garden. Léon slim and smart, with
 his little unconscious air of having
4075𓀴arrived without premeditation
 at the
 perfection of appearance. Monsieur
4076𓀴Gérard heavy, with
 a kind of sleepy
 uncertainty in his movements, and
4077𓀴the effect of forcible
 compression
 about the waist. There was something
4078𓀴to Rose very repulsive
 in the muffled
 greediness of Monsieur Gérard’s
4079𓀴expression. He looked
 at once selfish
 and burdened; it made her nervous
4080𓀴to see the two men
 together--for she
 had an idea that the burdens of the
4081𓀴selfish are apt to be
 readily transferred.
4082𓀴
4083𓀴She could not hear
 what they said,
 but she could see they were saying a
4084𓀴tremendous amount.
 First Monsieur Gérard
 would begin emphatically with a
4085𓀴puffy white forefinger
 attacking the
 air. His shoulders, his eyebrows,
4086𓀴his hat were volcanically active,
 speech broke from him in a cascade as
4087𓀴overwhelming and
 magnificent as the
 Tivoli Falls. Then he would pull
4088𓀴himself up abruptly,
 broken in upon
 by another torrent from Léon. Even
4089𓀴when they listened
 to each other their
 attention was as vivid as speech,
4090𓀴and they were capable
 at moments of
 catching each other’s speech without
4091𓀴discontinuing the rapid
 flow of their own.
4092𓀴
4093𓀴Rose thought their
 conversation must
 be about an opera; and she was sure
4094𓀴that if the opera was
 like their conversation
 it would be very exciting.
4095𓀴
4096𓀴There were moments
 when she thought
 the two men were angry, there were
4097𓀴others when the emotion
 between them
 seemed to rise up like a sudden
4098𓀴wind and possess the garden.
4099𓀴
4100𓀴On the whole it was Léon who was
 the most excited--he repeatedly said
4101𓀴“_Non!_”--but even
 from the balcony
 Rose gathered in his passionate
4102𓀴negative a reluctance for
 it to be taken as final.
4103𓀴
4104𓀴They parted with great affection;
 there was gratitude in Monsieur
4105𓀴Gérard’s attitude, and there was
 protection and soothing in that of
4106𓀴Léon’s. “But above
 all,” she heard
 her husband say, “with women one must
4107𓀴be practical.” They
 shook hands three
 times, then Monsieur Gérard waved
4108𓀴his hat to Rose and hurried
 out of the garden.
4109𓀴
4110𓀴Léon rejoined her,
 lighting a cigarette;
 his hands trembled a little,
4111𓀴his eyes were intensely
 bright. It
 struck Rose that he was restless,
4112𓀴more restless than usual.
4113𓀴
4114𓀴He hummed a little
 tune to himself
 and then, breaking off suddenly, told
4115𓀴her to bring him
 out her best hat.
4116𓀴
4117𓀴“It has an air,”
 he explained, “quite
 too much of the Sunday. I want to
4118𓀴eradicate it! A tranquil
 hat afflicts
 me! It has no power to move the
4119𓀴heart. In a hat, one
 should have peril.
 It should not be an accident, I
4120𓀴admit many are!
 But it should have
 an intention with a hint of danger.
4121𓀴Pass me the scissors.”
4122𓀴
4123𓀴Rose passed him the scissors. “I
 hope,” she ventured, “that Monsieur
4124𓀴Gérard hadn’t anything
 dreadful to say.”
4125𓀴
4126𓀴She thought it couldn’t have been
 very dreadful, for Léon was looking
4127𓀴distinctly pleased.
4128𓀴
4129𓀴However, he put
 a decent amount of
 gravity into the headshake with which
4130𓀴he answered her.
4131𓀴
4132𓀴“Everything is of the
 most complicated,”
 he assured her. “The affair
4133𓀴Gérard has literally
 come to pieces.
 The marriage has as little
4134𓀴integrity as the
 inside of a volcano.
 They walk on broken glass. It is
4135𓀴no longer a honeymoon--it
 is an inferno!”
4136𓀴
4137𓀴Rose cried out in
 horror. “But what
 has happened to them?” she asked
4138𓀴anxiously.
4139𓀴
4140𓀴“It is a long story,”
 said Léon, who
 had by now completely unpicked her
4141𓀴hat and was trying the trimming
 upside down, and rather liking the
4142𓀴effect. “But I shall tell you as
 much as I can. One must make the
4143𓀴troubles of others
 one’s own--must
 we not? Both our religions agree upon
4144𓀴that. _Non?_
4145𓀴
4146𓀴“It appears, in
 the first instance,
 the marriage was of Madame’s making.
4147𓀴
4148𓀴“She had the idea--common to many
 women--that she was born to be the
4149𓀴wife of a great
 artist. As a matter
 of fact, no women are born for that,
4150𓀴because no great
 artist should have
 a wife. They should have from time
4151𓀴to time a tragic union
 with a mistress--that
 develops them; wives do
4152𓀴not. Raoul was the
 only artist Madame
 knew. She was twenty-three, an
4153𓀴heiress, and as you
 see for yourself
 a charming little woman of the
4154𓀴world. She made a good impression
 upon Raoul. He discovered that
4155𓀴marriage with her
 would have a solid
 foundation. Now he has got it and
4156𓀴naturally he does
 not know what to
 do with it. Above all he finds that
4157𓀴Madame considers
 herself ill-used.
 She is, as I told you before,
4158𓀴romantic. She expected
 a grand passion,
 she knew him capable of one, but
4159𓀴she did not grasp that it could
 never be in her direction.
4160𓀴
4161𓀴“I find it myself
 a little bourgeois
 of her to expect Raoul to develop
4162𓀴such a thing for
 a wife. Do not look
 so like the Sunday hat, dear Rose!
4163𓀴Remember their marriage
 was a French
 one. Ours is English--therefore we
4164𓀴were in love. Still,
 of course, both
 were marriages!” Léon manipulated
4165𓀴the hat afresh,
 it was beginning to
 look less and less like Sunday. Rose
4166𓀴said nothing. She
 had a silly feeling
 that if she spoke she might cry.
4167𓀴She was very sorry
 for Madame Gérard.
4168𓀴
4169𓀴“That, then, is the
 grievance of Madame,”
 Léon went on. “She is young,
4170𓀴excitable and disappointed.
 You have
 that on one side. I must say that I
4171𓀴think she lacks
 management, but for
 all that one sympathizes with her.
4172𓀴
4173𓀴“His grievance is,
 however, more serious
 still. Because he has no grand
4174𓀴passion for her,
 Madame turns round
 and asserts that there is no real
4175𓀴marriage between them!--that, in
 short, if she cannot have the silver
4176𓀴moon, she won’t be
 put off with very
 good cheese of the day. You follow
4177𓀴me? She does not wish
 to be a wife to Raoul.”
4178𓀴
4179𓀴“Oh,” cried Rose
 incredulously, “oh,
 Léon, surely Monsieur Gérard did
4180𓀴not tell you this
 about his _wife_?”
4181𓀴
4182𓀴“But yes--” said
 Léon calmly, “why
 not? I, however, consider that if
4183𓀴Madame lacks management,
 Raoul lacks
 _souplesse_. Things should never
4184𓀴have been allowed to reach such a
 sharpness. I don’t say he could have
4185𓀴given her a grand
 passion, one can’t
 invent such things, but he might,
4186𓀴all the same, have
 lent himself to
 the situation during the honeymoon.
4187𓀴If a good woman cannot
 have a honeymoon,
 what can she have? The type
4188𓀴will die out if they are
 to be starved all round.”
4189𓀴
4190𓀴“Do you mean to say you want him
 to pretend?” Rose asked. She spoke
4191𓀴quietly, but the
 feeling behind her
 words made Léon throw down the hat
4192𓀴and catch her hands in his.
4193𓀴
4194𓀴“Ah!” he said, “you Queen of the
 Puritans! No! not pretend--but he
4195𓀴might--mightn’t he?--have for the
 moment have gone a trifle in advance
4196𓀴of the facts?”
4197𓀴
4198𓀴Rose withdrew her
 hand from his. “It
 seems to me,” she said, “all of it,
4199𓀴simply horrible!
 I don’t understand.
 How could he come here and tell you
4200𓀴such things--to
 talk about his wife
 and her feelings? Why, it’s all so
4201𓀴incredibly _private_!
 It’s as dreadful
 as if he’d killed her. I don’t
4202𓀴think I should have
 minded it half
 so much if he had. And what is the
4203𓀴_use_ of it, Léon--why
 did he come to you?”
4204𓀴
4205𓀴“Ah, that is why I told you at
 all,” Léon explained, a little
4206𓀴crestfallen. “Of
 course, I knew you
 would shrink from this affair. It is
4207𓀴natural that you should, though I
 cannot, for my part, see why, in a
4208𓀴strange land, surrounded
 by Italians,
 the poor Raoul shouldn’t be
4209𓀴allowed to consult
 a compatriot and
 a friend. However, it is really for
4210𓀴my assistance that he came, and I
 cannot give him that, Rose, without
4211𓀴your consent. It
 is simply a question
 of whether or no you are
4212𓀴sufficiently magnanimous.”
4213𓀴
4214𓀴“How do you mean?”
 asked Rose, more
 frightened still. “You know I can’t
4215𓀴talk French properly,
 and if I could
 I shouldn’t know what to say to
4216𓀴people like that!”
4217𓀴
4218𓀴“Oh, I didn’t ask
 you to mix yourself
 up in it,” Léon answered
4219𓀴reassuringly. “It
 is, however, perhaps
 even harder for most women--what
4220𓀴I have to ask of
 you! It is to stand
 aside and let me mix myself up in
4221𓀴it.”
4222𓀴
4223𓀴She shivered a little.
 “Oh, but why,”
 she asked, “should you be mixed up
4224𓀴in it? We only saw
 them yesterday!”
4225𓀴
4226𓀴Léon picked up the hat again. “It
 appears,” he said, “that I managed to
4227𓀴entertain Madame yesterday.
 Poor thing!
 she has been living the life of
4228𓀴a tortured Romantic.
 For the first
 time Raoul heard her laugh, saw her
4229𓀴smile, and he became attracted by
 the idea. He thought if I managed to
4230𓀴amuse her a little, she would be
 less tragic, and then, after a time,
4231𓀴she might submit her case to me,
 and I could, little by little, you
4232𓀴know, much as I
 have done with this
 hat--a feather here, a ribbon there,
4233𓀴readjust the situation.
 Such things
 have been done, you know, by people
4234𓀴of tact, and to save
 a marriage when
 one has oneself made such a success
4235𓀴of one’s own--isn’t
 that a duty one
 perhaps owes, in return for one’s
4236𓀴happiness?”
4237𓀴
4238𓀴Rose thought the
 situation over, that
 is to say, she felt it over. Here
4239𓀴and there her heart
 winced under the
 probes she gave it. She knew that
4240𓀴Léon was magnificent,
 and she felt
 humiliatingly conscious that she was
4241𓀴not as magnificent
 as Léon. She saw
 plainly enough what was required of
4242𓀴her. She was to
 stand aside for the
 sake of these strangers, she was to
4243𓀴give up her honeymoon, she was to
 be alone, and to let Léon spend his
4244𓀴time with this French
 lady, who was
 charming, and whom she could not
4245𓀴understand. She remembered what
 Léon had said, that he must not be
4246𓀴constrained, she remembered it
 perhaps too well. Her whole being
4247𓀴centered in the desire
 to leave him free.
4248𓀴
4249𓀴She shut her eyes
 and prayed. Léon
 did not know that she was praying,
4250𓀴but he felt a little
 uncomfortable.
 He was deeply sorry for the Gérards,
4251𓀴but there was no doubt that their
 complications had made the Island of
4252𓀴Capri more amusing.
4253𓀴
4254𓀴Rose opened her
 eyes wide. “Léon,”
 she said, “I want you to do whatever
4255𓀴you think right, and I
 will help you all I can.”
4256𓀴
4257𓀴He kissed her joyously.
 “There,” he
 said, “the perfect wife! What a pity
4258𓀴Madame cannot hear you! She would
 see the path of happiness without a
4259𓀴lesson! Of course
 you will help me.
 You will help me profoundly. Day by
4260𓀴day I shall bring you the history
 of my little attempt. It is on your
4261𓀴advice I will lean, the drama of
 it will be for both of us an immense
4262𓀴resource, and I
 have a feeling that
 for all of us it will have a happy
4263𓀴ending!”
4264𓀴
4265𓀴Rose did not share the feeling.
 She picked up the hat which he had
4266𓀴finished and tried
 it on. “It is very
 French,” she said doubtfully, “but
4267𓀴does it really suit me, Léon?”
4268𓀴
4269𓀴“Ah, you must make it suit you,”
 said Léon a little ironically. “I
4270𓀴cannot help you to that! It’s all
 a question of how you wear it!”
4271𓀴
4272𓀴
4273𓀴                  
             CHAPTER IX
4274𓀴
4275𓀴Léon had, from the
 first, the best
 intentions. He was to be the good
4276𓀴comrade to Raoul, the sympathetic
 counselor to Madame, and for the
4277𓀴situation in general
 a happy blend
 of an olive branch, a dove, and a
4278𓀴rainbow in the heavens!
4279𓀴
4280𓀴His shrewdness of
 judgment was only
 to be matched by the lightness of
4281𓀴his heart. For a
 month many of his
 most salient gifts had been lying
4282𓀴idle. Rose had not
 asked for management,
 and there had been in their
4283𓀴easy-going lovemaking no
 very great place for tact.
4284𓀴
4285𓀴Léon was on the look-out
 for difficulty,
 for gulfs of temperament and
4286𓀴training, efforts
 and sacrifices and
 gently taught lessons, but after a
4287𓀴time his look-out
 ceased. Rose looked
 out. She made the efforts, she
4288𓀴learned his lessons,
 before the need
 arose to teach her. In fact, she
4289𓀴saved him trouble, and there had
 been moments when Léon found this a
4290𓀴trifle dull. It
 was different now;
 his skill was called upon at every
4291𓀴turn. Madame Gérard
 was a very unhappy
 woman. She had had a spoilt
4292𓀴childhood and a sentimental and
 enthusiastic youth guarded at every
4293𓀴point from experience.
4294𓀴
4295𓀴All her adventures
 had been in her
 unfettered dreams. She had dreamed
4296𓀴that she should marry Raoul, and
 then she had married him. Life had
4297𓀴brought her up very
 short. She had
 believed in an exquisite and ideal
4298𓀴relationship and
 she had been given
 with terrible promptitude Monsieur
4299𓀴Gérard’s impression of what
 constituted the marriage tie.
4300𓀴
4301𓀴He had spoilt her
 dreams, he had shaken
 about her ears the fullness of
4302𓀴her life; but he
 was still the man
 she loved. All other men were but as
4303𓀴trees walking, even Léon was only
 a tree that walked. It was true that
4304𓀴he walked more and
 more frequently
 in her direction. She took a certain
4305𓀴notice of him, her
 heart lay in the
 dust but it began to mean something
4306𓀴to her that Léon
 resented this. She
 felt through the bitterness of her
4307𓀴shame a tiny spark
 of returning pride.
4308𓀴
4309𓀴It was a very tiny
 spark, it hardly
 amounted to self-respect--but Léon
4310𓀴guarded it and kept it alight, as
 a man shields a flickering match from
4311𓀴the rough air. He
 flattered her grossly
 at first because she was too sad
4312𓀴to understand subtlety.
 Afterwards,
 as her mind turned towards him, he
4313𓀴refined his flatteries.
 He kept her
 a little hungry so that she should
4314𓀴more and more look to him for
 this nourishment of the spirit.
4315𓀴
4316𓀴But Madame Gérard,
 in spite of her
 grief, was a kind-hearted little
4317𓀴woman. She remembered Rose.
4318𓀴
4319𓀴“We must not neglect
 her,” she would
 say gently, “the little English
4320𓀴wife. One does not
 cure one unhappiness
 by making another.” And Léon
4321𓀴would explain that
 the English were
 a strange race. They loved solitude,
4322𓀴speechlessness and wonderful long
 newspaper articles about politics.
4323𓀴Also Rose was learning
 French from
 a nun and she didn’t care to make a
4324𓀴third in their little
 amusements until
 she could talk more freely with
4325𓀴them.
4326𓀴
4327𓀴“She has a pride about it,” Léon
 explained. “These cold, silent women
4328𓀴are very proud.”
4329𓀴
4330𓀴“I should not have
 thought her cold,”
 said Madame Gérard, thoughtfully.
4331𓀴“She has kind eyes.
 When one is very
 unhappy one notices kind eyes.”
4332𓀴
4333𓀴Léon led the conversation back to
 Madame’s unhappiness and away from
4334𓀴Rose’s eyes. He
 had not meant to be
 disloyal to Rose, he rather liked to
4335𓀴think of her as cold
 and proud. After
 a time Madame no longer tried to
4336𓀴send him back to Rose; she was
 a Frenchwoman, even if she was
4337𓀴broken-hearted, and
 she was not slow
 to understand Léon. “This type,”
4338𓀴she said to herself, “will always
 be with some woman or other--with me
4339𓀴he is safe! I shall send him back
 to her as he came even perhaps a
4340𓀴little wiser, a little
 more appreciative
 of her. I will do her no bad
4341𓀴turn, the little English wife.”
4342𓀴
4343𓀴Madame Gérard had
 the best intentions,
 too. She had even better ones
4344𓀴than Léon, but neither
 of them perceived
 that they had them in the wrong
4345𓀴direction. Nevertheless,
 for a time
 all went well. Monsieur Gérard
4346𓀴studied for the
 coming opera season
 with a freer mind and in a better
4347𓀴temper.
4348𓀴
4349𓀴Rose took long lessons
 from the nun,
 and as she slowly and painstakingly
4350𓀴began to master the intricate and
 exquisite language of her husband she
4351𓀴felt as if she were
 approaching his
 spirit, and preparing for herself
4352𓀴and for him a fresh
 world of understanding
 and companionship. Day by day
4353𓀴Léon brought her, with
 fresh enthusiasm,
 endless stories of his progress
4354𓀴with the affair Gérard.
 Some instinct
 in Rose told her that by the
4355𓀴length of these stories,
 and by Léon’s
 absorbed, invigorated returns to
4356𓀴her, their love was still safe.
4357𓀴
4358𓀴She needed all the
 assurances that
 she could get, for she was very much
4359𓀴alone. She was always
 just the same
 to Léon; she spread about him the
4360𓀴warm, wide sea of
 her magnanimity;
 he was never to know she felt sad or
4361𓀴strange, or that she
 had a silly habit
 of almost crying when she walked
4362𓀴alone on the cliffs above
 the bright, transparent sea.
4363𓀴
4364𓀴He wasn’t to dream
 that she minded
 his boating and driving and walking
4365𓀴with Madame Gérard,
 or that she kept
 explaining to herself how natural
4366𓀴it was for him to
 talk more and with
 more gaiety in French, and not to
4367𓀴care so much as he used to
 for moonlight in the garden.
4368𓀴
4369𓀴She succeeded so entirely in the
 effect of appearing not to mind that
4370𓀴she thoroughly annoyed Léon.
4371𓀴
4372𓀴He had been looking
 forward to a fresh
 drama with Rose, a little visible
4373𓀴but not fettering
 jealousy, a scene
 or two, even a few tears, wise and
4374𓀴tender explanation
 on his part, and
 passionate pleading upon her own.
4375𓀴
4376𓀴But Rose’s passion was very quiet
 and it never occurred to it to plead.
4377𓀴
4378𓀴She had no such
 intention, but she
 made Léon’s vanity smart, under her
4379𓀴daily serenity. “Is she made of
 wood--or of iron,” he asked himself
4380𓀴bitterly, “that she lets me live
 in the pocket of another woman even
4381𓀴during the honeymoon?
 What have I to
 look forward to--centuries of ice?”
4382𓀴
4383𓀴He knew very well
 that there was no
 ice in Rose, but his bad conscience
4384𓀴enjoyed resentment very much. It
 was not only his vanity that was
4385𓀴injured, he began to be
 conscious of a secret fear.
4386𓀴
4387𓀴Rose was to be his guardian angel
 in this affair--he mustn’t, whatever
4388𓀴happened, be allowed
 to lose his head.
4389𓀴
4390𓀴He didn’t expect his wife to stop
 his doing what he wanted, but she
4391𓀴ought to be so effective,
 so in the
 center of things as to prevent his
4392𓀴wanting it, and
 Rose wouldn’t come
 into the center of things. She
4393𓀴remained in the background,
 trusting
 him. He felt the burden of her
4394𓀴confidence checking
 him at every turn.
4395𓀴
4396𓀴There was danger, and she didn’t
 see danger. Was she going to walk
4397𓀴straight through it,
 with her wonderful
 blue eyes forever unaware?
4398𓀴
4399𓀴She ought to have realized that
 however noble a man is, and however
4400𓀴unhappy a woman, a
 situation in which,
 from the best motives, they are
4401𓀴constantly thrown together,
 needs watching.
 A most unfortunate thing had
4402𓀴already happened. Madame
 had discovered,
 from an unguarded remark of
4403𓀴Léon’s, that he
 had talked with her
 husband about her. Madame Gérard had
4404𓀴a constructive mind--if
 two and two
 were anywhere about, it did not take
4405𓀴her long to arrive
 at four. Instantly
 she understood: this new
4406𓀴companionship, the
 devout attention
 of her husband’s friend was nothing
4407𓀴at all but a plot between the two
 men to play with her broken heart!
4408𓀴
4409𓀴She knew their aim;
 it was to make
 her compliant to the lowest needs of
4410𓀴one who had not so much affection
 for her as a stray dog for the hand
4411𓀴that strokes it.
 To say that Madame
 Gérard was angry at this discovery
4412𓀴is to underestimate
 the uses of language.
 She was attacked by a bitter
4413𓀴fury of outraged pride.
 Léon had brought
 back her pride, then, simply in
4414𓀴order to outrage
 it! But this time
 she kept her head. Any woman can keep
4415𓀴her head with a man with
 whom she is not in love.
4416𓀴
4417𓀴Madame Gérard knew herself to be
 standing with her back to the wall,
4418𓀴fighting for her life against two
 men, one of them at least she could
4419𓀴injure.
4420𓀴
4421𓀴She gave herself
 a moment of despair,
 her small hand clutched fiercely
4422𓀴at a little stone beside the path
 near which they sat--her hidden eyes
4423𓀴burned with unshed
 tears. For a long
 moment she held herself in silence,
4424𓀴while she let Léon
 cover up his mistake
 as if she had not heard him;
4425𓀴then, being a practical
 woman, she
 put despair away till afterwards:
4426𓀴besides, despair could
 only hurt herself.
4427𓀴
4428𓀴It was a pity that in destroying
 Léon’s marriage she should have to
4429𓀴destroy Rose’s.
 Enraged as she was,
 she thought of this; still, she
4430𓀴couldn’t stop to consider a woman
 who, if she had had the least sense,
4431𓀴would have interfered in
 the whole affair long ago.
4432𓀴
4433𓀴“You are not angry,” Léon urged,
 “that I should have touched on your
4434𓀴sufferings with the good Raoul?”
4435𓀴
4436𓀴Madame laughed softly and looked
 at Léon with provocative, caressing
4437𓀴eyes.
4438𓀴
4439𓀴“You who know women--must
 know how
 safe you are from me,” she replied.
4440𓀴“Do I look angry?”
 She did not look
 angry, but she looked provocative,
4441𓀴and this was the first time that
 she had looked provocative.
4442𓀴
4443𓀴It was the difference
 between a battery
 turned on and a battery turned
4444𓀴off. Madame Gérard,
 like all Frenchwomen,
 could use her sex or sink it
4445𓀴as the occasion required. Up till
 now she had never used it, she had
4446𓀴kept it steadily
 in abeyance out of
 respect to Rose. Now Rose had to go,
4447𓀴respect had to go,
 everything had to
 go--but her fierce rage against the
4448𓀴two men who were in league
 against her pride.
4449𓀴
4450𓀴It was no wonder that Léon began
 to be afraid, even though it must be
4451𓀴admitted that his
 fear was chiefly
 of a pleasurable nature, nor that
4452𓀴Monsieur Gérard should
 suddenly feel
 that he had evoked rather more help
4453𓀴than he needed; nor
 that Rose should
 find herself not only more alone
4454𓀴but suddenly deprived
 of the support
 of the long histories Léon used to
4455𓀴make to her, on his returns.
4456𓀴
4457𓀴He could no longer tell her what
 took place between him and Madame;
4458𓀴speech had become a medium for
 something better not explained.
4459𓀴
4460𓀴Madame Gérard was the only one of
 the group who appeared wholly at her
4461𓀴ease; all her energies were being
 freely used, and in the direction she
4462𓀴had chosen for them.
 She was making
 her husband jealous, Léon infatuated
4463𓀴and giving the stupid
 English wife
 plenty of time to learn French.
4464𓀴
4465𓀴The good intentions
 of everybody began
 to look a little like the fashion
4466𓀴of the year before last.
4467𓀴
4468𓀴
4469𓀴                  
             CHAPTER X
4470𓀴
4471𓀴It was part of their
 general attention
 to the surface of things that
4472𓀴Rose was never to
 appear deserted.
4473𓀴
4474𓀴Léon and Madame tore
 themselves away
 from her with public reluctance at
4475𓀴the garden gate;
 they rejoined her
 eagerly like creatures reprieved,
4476𓀴after a prolonged but
 obviously penal absence.
4477𓀴
4478𓀴They even arranged
 between them times
 and occasions when Monsieur Gérard
4479𓀴should also be represented,
 when the
 united four, like a procession on
4480𓀴parade, strolled before
 the watching eyes of Capri.
4481𓀴
4482𓀴The watching eyes of
 Capri are indulgently
 accustomed to youth and
4483𓀴change, they are incapable
 of the element
 of shock, but they are equally
4484𓀴incapable of the
 delusion of a good
 appearance. When Capri beheld Rose
4485𓀴and Léon issuing from
 the Hotel Paradiso
 on their way to a “Thé Intime”
4486𓀴at the Villa degli
 Angeli, Capri was
 not hoodwinked by this overflow of
4487𓀴a dual domesticity,
 rather it laid
 a finger to the nose and cried, from
4488𓀴one doorway to the other,
 “Behold!--a festa of knives!”
4489𓀴
4490𓀴It was a many-colored
 day in the late
 spring, the bright air shimmered
4491𓀴and danced like the
 bubbles in champagne.
 The Villa degli Angeli shone
4492𓀴pillow-shaped and glittering in a
 rose-hung garden. Wistaria streamed
4493𓀴from its porch,
 and cloaked like a
 shield its romantic lovers’ balcony.
4494𓀴
4495𓀴Inside the high-ceilinged, gilded
 little salon, Madame Gérard moved
4496𓀴gracefully to and fro--she wore a
 white dress with touches of scarlet
4497𓀴and gold; her lips were very red,
 her cheeks were lightly powdered, her
4498𓀴eyes had a certain
 sparkle in them,
 and the heels of her small white
4499𓀴shoes were thrillingly
 high. It struck
 Rose, not for the first time,
4500𓀴that there was really
 no use being
 much prettier than that. Madame
4501𓀴Gérard greeted Rose with ecstatic
 pleasure and Léon with a charming
4502𓀴ironic gravity;
 behind her from the
 gloom Monsieur Gérard moved heavily
4503𓀴forward. It was
 plain that he found
 the occasion exhausting. Monsieur
4504𓀴Gérard easily exhausted
 most occasions,
 his was not a revivifying
4505𓀴nature; still, there
 was a certain
 dignity in the way he murmured over
4506𓀴Rose’s hand that
 he was impressed,
 greatly impressed, by her visit. She
4507𓀴remembered that he
 had been impressed
 before. Rose would have liked to
4508𓀴have said something
 pleasant in return,
 but it is difficult to appear
4509𓀴full of _savoir faire_
 when expression
 is limited to requests for hot
4510𓀴water, the superficial
 qualities of
 dogs and cats, the time of day, and
4511𓀴the habits of railway trains.
4512𓀴
4513𓀴Rose could talk
 quite easily about
 these things by now, and she was also
4514𓀴an expert in weather
 and could have
 made herself into a well of sympathy
4515𓀴to an invalid, but
 for ordinary tea-party
 purposes her French hung fire.
4516𓀴
4517𓀴The burden of entertainment
 fell naturally
 enough upon Madame. She was
4518𓀴equal to it, in
 all probability she
 had arranged her rôle in advance.
4519𓀴
4520𓀴The week had gone well with her.
 Monsieur Gérard had been roused from
4521𓀴practising operas
 and from nervous
 hostility over his matrimonial
4522𓀴liabilities. He perceived that at
 one stroke his liabilities and his
4523𓀴security had been
 snatched from him.
 He was jealous and had begun to be
4524𓀴a little eager; but Madame
 did not meet him half-way.
4525𓀴
4526𓀴She no longer bored him to make
 love to her, indeed she ignored any
4527𓀴opening for his attention; she
 lived exquisitely and extremely
4528𓀴unapproachably a life of her own.
 Monsieur Gérard resented this; he
4529𓀴hadn’t meant anything so extreme,
 but he did not see his way to put an
4530𓀴end to it. Madame
 knew perfectly that
 he was ready to put an end to it,
4531𓀴and she had arranged
 this occasion,
 both that he might be given his
4532𓀴opportunity and that
 Léon might receive
 the punishment that he deserved.
4533𓀴
4534𓀴Léon had wanted, it appeared, to
 reunite her to her husband. This was
4535𓀴the height of kindness
 on his part;
 she would repay him by showing him
4536𓀴that his efforts were a little in
 arrear of the facts. But alas! once
4537𓀴more she showed that
 lack of intelligence
 to be found in the cleverest
4538𓀴of women when they
 are dealing with
 the man they love. She understood
4539𓀴the man--she had
 proved it--but she
 muddled the love. She should have
4540𓀴hooked her fish
 before she dangled
 it before the exasperated eyes of
4541𓀴Léon, and she should
 have remembered
 that it was only half a fish--and
4542𓀴half an artist. But at first she
 was satisfied with the rôle of the
4543𓀴perfect wife--instantly
 she succeeded
 in exasperating Léon. She drew her
4544𓀴husband skilfully and prominently
 into the front of the situation; she
4545𓀴did not praise him, but little by
 little she tapped the fount of his
4546𓀴successes.
4547𓀴
4548𓀴She laid him out
 before her guests
 with delicate touches that were far
4549𓀴finer than praise.
 It was intoxicating
 for Monsieur Gérard. After a
4550𓀴week’s complete indifference
 he found
 himself a hero in his wife’s eyes!
4551𓀴
4552𓀴He found himself also in the most
 comfortable chair in the room (for
4553𓀴with men over forty
 a certain attention
 must be paid to an appropriate
4554𓀴background) and enjoying
 a wonderful
 “gouter” in which his taste ruled
4555𓀴supreme. Lately Madame
 had not studied
 his taste, but for the occasion
4556𓀴everything his fancy desired had
 been obtained for him. His future
4557𓀴spread before him
 in a rosy glow--after
 all this marriage of his had not
4558𓀴been a great mistake--he
 rather wished
 he had not taken Léon into his
4559𓀴confidence about
 it; still, it was
 amusing to watch the fellow’s nose
4560𓀴slipping out of
 joint! He would now
 have to return to his dull little
4561𓀴wife--that would be punishment
 enough for any man!
4562𓀴
4563𓀴Léon was a bad loser;
 he became first
 restive, then actively hostile,
4564𓀴finally sulky. Madame
 turned his active
 hostility into gentle ridicule;
4565𓀴his restlessness served somehow
 to bring out the grand nature of
4566𓀴Monsieur Gérard. The grand nature
 of Monsieur Gérard was not as a rule,
4567𓀴active; and Léon, confronted with
 a specimen of it, sank into silent
4568𓀴resentment.
4569𓀴
4570𓀴Even this tent of
 Achilles was not,
 however, left to him; it blew this
4571𓀴way and that under
 the delicate raillery
 of Madame. She noticed that
4572𓀴Monsieur was out of spirits?
4573𓀴
4574𓀴She attacked Rose
 about it. “A woman
 is responsible for all that happens
4575𓀴to a man during his honeymoon,
 is she not?” she asked her. Rose,
4576𓀴thinking that Madame
 was doubtful as
 to the state of Léon’s health, told
4577𓀴her painstakingly
 that Léon was an
 “esprit fort.” Madame, with a happy
4578𓀴little shriek, proclaimed
 that she
 was sure of it, but was not his wit
4579𓀴like Madame’s own--this
 afternoon,
 at any rate--of the wonderful silent
4580𓀴English type? Even
 Monsieur Gérard
 laughed at this, but on the whole
4581𓀴Madame spared Rose;
 she kept as far
 as possible her hand off her. She
4582𓀴would gladly have spared
 her altogether,
 and, in a sense, of course, she
4583𓀴was doing so. She
 was giving her her
 husband back--not wiser, nor more
4584𓀴appreciative, and certainly in a
 far worse state of mind--but for all
4585𓀴that he would be returned to Rose
 this afternoon not so very much the
4586𓀴worse for wear, as husbands go.
4587𓀴
4588𓀴For half-an-hour
 Madame Gérard took
 upon her little supple shoulders the
4589𓀴entertainment of
 her guests. She was
 for that half hour like the whole
4590𓀴cast of the Comédie Française put
 together--brilliant, exquisitely
4591𓀴decorative and incredibly,
 ironically
 knowing; then she turned to her
4592𓀴husband with her eyes
 like an innocent
 caress, and said, “Now, _mon
4593𓀴ami_, will you not
 make music for us?”
 Monsieur Gérard was not unwilling
4594𓀴to use his magnificent
 gift. Léon,
 who felt that the end had come,
4595𓀴politely echoed the
 request; and then
 Madame made her fatal mistake. The
4596𓀴game was hers--she
 had only to stand
 aside and let it finish itself; but
4597𓀴she could not stand
 aside--nervously,
 with happy flutterings, she must
4598𓀴show them how she followed
 her husband’s
 work, and how she helped him:
4599𓀴and she didn’t help him at all.
4600𓀴
4601𓀴She drew out his music--it wasn’t
 what he wanted to sing and he said so
4602𓀴crisply; he always
 knew what he wanted
 to sing. Then she said she must
4603𓀴play his accompaniment,
 so that he
 could stand up and let his voice out.
4604𓀴
4605𓀴Now Monsieur Gérard’s
 voice was not
 of a quantity to be lightly let out
4606𓀴in a small bird-cage
 of a room; it
 would have been sufficient to roll
4607𓀴over Capri like a
 rock-stream. Also,
 Monsieur Gérard was like a tiger to
4608𓀴any accompanist but
 his own, who was
 taking at the moment a much-needed
4609𓀴holiday.
4610𓀴
4611𓀴It counted for nothing
 at all with
 Monsieur Gérard that his wife was
4612𓀴dressed in white
 and scarlet and gold
 and that she had roused in him the
4613𓀴temporary sentiments
 of attraction.
 From the moment that she mounted the
4614𓀴music-stool nothing counted but
 her power of playing a correct
4615𓀴accompaniment without
 too much expression.
 She had evoked the artist,
4616𓀴and the artist upsets everything.
4617𓀴
4618𓀴Monsieur Gérard began to sing; he
 modulated his great dramatic voice,
4619𓀴but the sound of
 it shook the Villa
 degli Angeli; it poured out on the
4620𓀴dancing air with
 the majestic roll
 of great billows breaking on the
4621𓀴beach.
4622𓀴
4623𓀴Madame tinkled mildly
 and prettily
 on the piano after him--too prettily
4624𓀴of course, and not
 very accurately.
 The little ineffective notes were
4625𓀴like a pee-wit chirping
 in a storm.
 In an instant Monsieur Gérard had
4626𓀴swept her from the
 music-stool almost
 on to the floor. “You have no more
4627𓀴music in you than
 a fly!” he broke
 off abruptly to inform her, then he
4628𓀴sat down in her place and roared
 in velvet with magnificent effect.
4629𓀴
4630𓀴Madame, shaken and
 reduced from triumph
 to the verge of tears, quivered
4631𓀴for a little in the window-seat;
 but even then her prize was still
4632𓀴within her grasp--Monsieur
 had simply
 for the moment forgotten her. She
4633𓀴was capable, if
 she had waited, of
 reminding him successfully. Alas! she
4634𓀴had that fatal longing
 to help which
 reduces the greatest women to the
4635𓀴level of a nuisance.
 She could not
 let herself be forgotten even for a
4636𓀴moment--even for
 his art. She would
 go back and turn over the leaves for
4637𓀴Raoul. He frowned,
 he swore under his
 breath, he shook his heavy head at
4638𓀴her; but she went on turning over
 the leaves--he was not playing to the
4639𓀴score, he did not want his leaves
 turned over--her eager, fluttering
4640𓀴figure drove him frantic.
 In ten minutes
 he banged the piano lid down,
4641𓀴and threw the score
 on the carpet.
 He told her before Léon, before Rose,
4642𓀴in the drawing-room
 of the Villa degli
 Angeli that she was an intrusive
4643𓀴insect!
4644𓀴
4645𓀴There was a horrible
 pause. Léon approached
 Madame in a state of mingled
4646𓀴chivalry and satisfaction.
 She was
 a pitiable figure as she stood there
4647𓀴biting at her dainty
 lace handkerchief
 to keep the tears back; her face
4648𓀴was very white under its layer of
 powder. Probably it would have been
4649𓀴better if she had
 sat down. She simply
 stood with imploring, helpless
4650𓀴eyes fixed upon the angry
 tyrant before her.
4651𓀴
4652𓀴No angry man likes
 to be looked at
 helplessly. Monsieur Gérard glared at
4653𓀴her--then he made the gulf that
 had come between them impassable.
4654𓀴
4655𓀴“Understand!” he shouted, turning
 the music still on the piano to and
4656𓀴fro, as if he were
 making hay, “To-night
 I go to Naples! I cannot stand
4657𓀴more of this! I will
 go to Naples for
 one night, for two--for three! You
4658𓀴must remain here!
 I go to Naples!”
 Madame’s eyes went from her husband
4659𓀴to Léon. Léon’s
 eyes were fixed on
 hers in pity, in forgiveness--and
4660𓀴were they also fixed
 a little in expectation?
 He knew, and Madame knew,
4661𓀴precisely the purpose of Monsieur
 Gérard in going to Naples.
4662𓀴
4663𓀴Rose did not understand
 as much as
 this, but she thought it was very
4664𓀴wicked of Monsieur
 Gérard to go away
 from his wife on their honeymoon
4665𓀴because she tried to turn
 over the leaves of his music.
4666𓀴
4667𓀴She got up and crossed
 the room towards
 Madame. It was Rose who put an
4668𓀴end to the unendurable silence.
4669𓀴
4670𓀴Léon was waiting for
 a cue from Madame,
 and Madame was too stunned to
4671𓀴give him any cue.
 She was like a little
 helpless leaf that has brought
4672𓀴on its own storm, but Rose waited
 for nothing. She looked first at
4673𓀴Monsieur Gérard.
 She compelled that
 enraged artist to meet her steady,
4674𓀴disapproving eyes;
 then she held out
 her hand to Madame Gérard and with
4675𓀴a gracious diffidence
 that was the
 perfection of dignity, she said in
4676𓀴her stumbling French,
 “I hope very
 much, Madame, that if your husband is
4677𓀴to leave you for
 a few days, you will
 give us as much of your company as
4678𓀴possible.”
4679𓀴
4680𓀴Madame excused herself.
 She murmured
 under her breath that Rose was too
4681𓀴kind. Once more
 her eyes flickered
 from her husband to Léon. “It is a
4682𓀴great happiness to me to second
 my wife’s invitation,” said Léon
4683𓀴gravely. He murmured
 something more
 as he bowed over her hand and kissed
4684𓀴it. Rose had already
 turned and without
 even glancing in the direction
4685𓀴of Monsieur Gérard she went
 out into the gay little garden.
4686𓀴
4687𓀴Capri saw them return
 to the Hotel Paradiso.
4688𓀴
4689𓀴Léon was remorsefully
 attentive to
 his wife; he treated her as if she
4690𓀴were something very valuable
 that might break.
4691𓀴
4692𓀴Perhaps in some
 subconscious way he
 knew that he was going to break her,
4693𓀴but he was very much impressed
 by her behavior.
4694𓀴
4695𓀴She was, he thought
 to himself, the
 soul of generosity, and when we are
4696𓀴sure that we have the
 soul of generosity
 to deal with we sometimes find
4697𓀴it difficult not to
 take advantage of it.
4698𓀴
4699𓀴
4700𓀴                  
             CHAPTER XI
4701𓀴
4702𓀴The next day Monsieur
 Gérard carried
 out his intention of going to
4703𓀴Naples.
4704𓀴
4705𓀴Madame Gérard remained invisible.
 She accepted the flowers Léon called
4706𓀴upon her to present,
 but she sent down
 a message that she was indisposed
4707𓀴and could see nobody. She was
 indisposed until five o’clock the
4708𓀴following day. By this time
 she had made up her mind.
4709𓀴
4710𓀴It was not an easy task. She said
 to herself again and again that she
4711𓀴would have accepted
 heartbreak--but
 she could not accept outrage. Her
4712𓀴husband had not only
 cruelly wronged
 her--he had done so publicly before
4713𓀴the eyes of a man
 who loved her--and
 before his wife. Her marriage was a
4714𓀴false step--it had been her first
 adventure--but in her imagination she
4715𓀴had only counted
 upon adventures as
 successes--now she was face to face
4716𓀴with an adventure
 which had proved
 a failure. She could not go back--she
4717𓀴could only go on--and
 yet she hesitated,
 for after marriage, adventures
4718𓀴that go on are no
 longer innocent.
 Her husband had left her with a
4719𓀴weapon lying within
 her reach--from
 the first it had occurred to her
4720𓀴that she could strike back with
 Léon, but with this idea had come
4721𓀴another one, that
 in striking back
 she must cruelly wound an innocent
4722𓀴and happy woman.
 In all the horrible
 scene which had taken place the day
4723𓀴before there had
 only been one moment
 less intolerable than the others,
4724𓀴and Rose had given
 her that moment.
 She had distinctly stood by her with
4725𓀴an offer of friendship.
4726𓀴
4727𓀴Madame Gérard spent twenty-four
 bitter, sleepless hours considering
4728𓀴Rose. At the end
 of that time--having
 come to the decision that she did
4729𓀴not want to hurt
 her, but that she
 wished to do the thing that would
4730𓀴hurt her--she made
 the further decision
 that, after all, it need not
4731𓀴hurt Rose so very much. When she
 thought of her own unhappiness, a
4732𓀴little distress on
 the part of other
 wives did not seem out of place.
4733𓀴
4734𓀴She would do her
 best to shield Rose
 from the truth, but she wouldn’t do
4735𓀴anything to prevent
 the truth taking
 place. These two decisions placed
4736𓀴her in a better position than
 Léon. Léon had decided nothing.
4737𓀴
4738𓀴He only knew that
 he must see this
 complex woman, that he must, out of
4739𓀴chivalry, discover what she felt
 about the incredible behavior of her
4740𓀴husband. He must
 find out also--in
 honor or common kindness--if there
4741𓀴wasn’t in the situation
 some successful
 part for a good friend to play.
4742𓀴He drew upon all his virtues for
 his reasons. Yesterday Madame had
4743𓀴sharply wounded
 his _amour propre_;
 he saw that she had been playing a
4744𓀴game with him. Well, the game had
 failed, and yet he was still there;
4745𓀴there was therefore
 still the possibility
 of a new game under new
4746𓀴conditions, with the advantage,
 perhaps, to him.
4747𓀴
4748𓀴He went no further than that. He
 wanted, he assured himself, to go no
4749𓀴further. He was full
 of consideration
 for Rose, but he distinctly wished
4750𓀴to see how far he could go.
4751𓀴
4752𓀴At five o’clock he found
 himself admitted.
 Madame was already out in the
4753𓀴sheltered wistaria-covered
 balcony.
 She lay in a long chair draped in a
4754𓀴soft white robe;
 there were pearls
 round her neck and a little black
4755𓀴velvet band. She looked
 extraordinarily
 pathetic and young and very
4756𓀴tired of grief.
4757𓀴
4758𓀴There were no traces
 of tears on her
 little white face--but she was not
4759𓀴the woman to allow traces of any
 kind to appear, unless they were
4760𓀴becoming.
4761𓀴
4762𓀴“It was kind of you to come,” she
 said gently after a long pause.
4763𓀴“Forgive me, I had misjudged you.
 I thought that you were playing with
4764𓀴me.”
4765𓀴
4766𓀴Léon protested eagerly,
 how could she
 have had such an idea? One did not
4767𓀴go about playing with
 young and innocent
 women who were unhappy. She
4768𓀴must not do him
 so much injustice.
4769𓀴
4770𓀴He talked for five minutes nobly
 and eloquently about unhappy young
4771𓀴married women. Madame
 Gérard listened,
 looking between the wistaria
4772𓀴branches towards the sea. When he
 had quite finished she said gently,
4773𓀴“And yet it was
 a plot between you
 and my husband--your friendship, your
4774𓀴attention to me--they
 were not very
 real, Monsieur. You had agreed with
4775𓀴him to win me over to his
 wishes. Is that not so?”
4776𓀴
4777𓀴Léon was upset. You can never be
 sure what a husband will not tell a
4778𓀴wife, even an estranged and angry
 husband. There is a terrible habit of
4779𓀴indiscriminate confidence
 in marriage.
 Léon had come across it before.
4780𓀴
4781𓀴He would have eagerly
 denied conjecture,
 but it would not do to deny a
4782𓀴confidence; besides
 he was secretly
 much relieved at this new version of
4783𓀴things. He had been
 afraid that Madame
 had been playing with him; it
4784𓀴appeared now that
 he had been playing
 with her. What had happened
4785𓀴yesterday was merely
 a charming little
 feminine _revanche_. He began to
4786𓀴find the part he was
 playing more attractive.
4787𓀴
4788𓀴“It is true,” he
 said at last, “your
 husband told me that your marriage
4789𓀴was not happy--and
 to begin with perhaps
 I had the idea that it lay with
4790𓀴you to make it so.
 Forgive me, this
 idea soon passed. It passed before
4791𓀴the affair of the
 other day showed
 me the incredible _lacheté_ of Raoul.
4792𓀴Permit me to say
 that his behavior
 shocked me to the heart; but before
4793𓀴this shock took
 place I had learned
 in what light to consider you.
4794𓀴Believe me, I have
 not been playing
 with you. I am in earnest, in
4795𓀴terrible earnest.”
4796𓀴
4797𓀴She turned her eyes to his. They
 were not beautiful eyes like
4798𓀴Rose’s--but he did
 not know them so
 well, besides she used them better.
4799𓀴“You are really
 in earnest, really,
 Léon?” she asked him searchingly. He
4800𓀴sprang to his feet,
 but with a wave
 of her hand she motioned to him to
4801𓀴remain where he was.
4802𓀴
4803𓀴“I wonder,” she said very softly.
 “I do not want to be twice deceived,
4804𓀴to be deceived once
 is to go broken-winged
 through life, but to be
4805𓀴deceived twice, could
 one live at all?”
4806𓀴
4807𓀴“I swear that I have not deceived
 you--that I will never deceive you!”
4808𓀴cried Léon passionately.
 “The feeling
 that I have for you is real--it is
4809𓀴intense.”
4810𓀴
4811𓀴Still he meant to stay at Capri;
 he hadn’t any idea of doing anything
4812𓀴else.
4813𓀴
4814𓀴“You are prepared,”
 she asked him,
 “to prove your words to me? You
4815𓀴realize if I believe them what is
 at stake for me--and if you realize
4816𓀴that, do you not
 think that I have
 the right to ask you for a proof?”
4817𓀴
4818𓀴“You shall not ask
 me for one!” he
 cried. “Rather I will give you _all_
4819𓀴the proofs in my power--one
 or a dozen--what
 you will--you have only to
4820𓀴ask!”
4821𓀴
4822𓀴“You are very generous,” she said
 with her pretty irony. “One will be
4823𓀴enough. I want you
 to-night to take
 me to Naples. I cannot stay in Capri
4824𓀴until my husband
 returns. I will not
 return alone to France. It appears
4825𓀴that we made a mistake
 in not going
 to Naples for our honeymoon. Let us
4826𓀴then--you and I--rectify
 this mistake.”
4827𓀴
4828𓀴Léon said nothing.
 He gripped at the
 little wooden balcony railing with
4829𓀴both hands, and stared
 with blank eyes
 at the laughing sea. Leave Capri!
4830𓀴Leave Rose! His heart
 shuddered within
 him--with every honest fiber of
4831𓀴his nature, and
 he had many honest
 fibers in his nature, he loved Rose.
4832𓀴He did not love the woman before
 him--but he had sought what she
4833𓀴offered--how could
 he refuse it? It
 was true he had expected to make his
4834𓀴own terms, but this
 would not be very
 easy to explain to her. Still, he
4835𓀴tried hard to keep
 the situation in hand.
4836𓀴
4837𓀴“I have said,” he began at last,
 “that I considered your husband, in
4838𓀴leaving you, to
 have committed the
 worst of infamies. You are asking me
4839𓀴to commit the same.”
4840𓀴
4841𓀴Madame raised her eyebrows.
4842𓀴
4843𓀴“You mean in leaving
 your wife?” she
 asked. “After what you have allowed
4844𓀴me to suppose, I
 had not thought you
 would have that feeling. Nor would
4845𓀴it be necessary for you to act
 as my husband has acted. But I am
4846𓀴supposing, of course, that what
 you feel for me is--real.”
4847𓀴
4848𓀴“Pardon me, Madame,”
 said Léon firmly,
 “all that I have said to you is
4849𓀴true--and yet--is it incredible
 to you?--I love my wife!”
4850𓀴
4851𓀴Madame smiled at him.
4852𓀴
4853𓀴“You know how children
 play with daisies?”
 she said. “As they pull off
4854𓀴the little white petals
 one by one--‘He
 loves me--a little, very much,
4855𓀴passionately, not
 at all.’ It is funny
 what comes after passionately--so
4856𓀴soon after, Léon.”
4857𓀴
4858𓀴He stirred uneasily.
 Madame began to
 pull to pieces a spray of wistaria,
4859𓀴throwing the blossoms
 one by one smilingly
 into her lap. “I do not ask
4860𓀴you, my friend,” she
 said slowly, “for
 the devotion of a lifetime--there
4861𓀴are hardly enough to go round of
 these blossoms--we must not stop at
4862𓀴passionately, must
 we--we must stop
 at not at all! I was thinking of
4863𓀴spending three days in Naples.”
4864𓀴
4865𓀴“And you would expect me to leave
 you in three days?” asked Léon
4866𓀴reproachfully. He watched
 her feverishly.
 A man must know what he is in
4867𓀴for. “In three days,”
 said Madame,
 throwing all the silvery mauve
4868𓀴blossoms with a quick
 little gesture
 over the balcony, “I should insist
4869𓀴upon your leaving
 me.” As she did this
 her small, firm hand touched his.
4870𓀴He caught it to
 his lips and kissed
 it fervently. The smile in her eyes
4871𓀴deepened.
4872𓀴
4873𓀴She supposed he must have stopped
 thinking of Rose, but he said again,
4874𓀴after a moment’s pause, “To leave
 her--to leave her--that seems somehow
4875𓀴very base!”
4876𓀴
4877𓀴“Then do not leave
 her,” said Madame
 wearily, withdrawing her hand.
4878𓀴“Break your word
 to me, it is very
 simple. I have no claim on you--I am
4879𓀴not your wife.”
4880𓀴
4881𓀴“You are everything in the world
 to me,” he said desperately. For the
4882𓀴moment he believed she was.
4883𓀴
4884𓀴She leaned forward a little.
4885𓀴
4886𓀴“After all,” she said, “your wife
 will not know why you go to Naples.
4887𓀴You have only to say
 you go on business.
 She is so innocent she will
4888𓀴believe you--you might even tell
 her that you are to act as my escort
4889𓀴back to my husband.
 She need not suffer.”
4890𓀴
4891𓀴Léon flung back his head. “But,”
 he stammered, his eyes filling with
4892𓀴sudden tears, “I
 cannot lie to Rose!
 She is not like that! I cannot lie
4893𓀴to her--it is as you say,
 she would believe me!”
4894𓀴
4895𓀴“Ah,” said Madame,
 “let us hope then
 that you can lie about women better
4896𓀴than you can lie to them! But you
 are making a mistake. It is very easy
4897𓀴to lie to us. All men
 have found it so.”
4898𓀴
4899𓀴He pushed her words
 away from him.
4900𓀴
4901𓀴“Elise,” he asked
 her suddenly, “do
 you care for me? This thing that you
4902𓀴are about to do, is
 it from your heart?”
4903𓀴
4904𓀴She rose and stood beside him.
4905𓀴
4906𓀴“I will give you the proof,”
 she said in a low voice.
4907𓀴
4908𓀴But still he was not satisfied;
 his eyes continued to question her.
4909𓀴
4910𓀴“It is from my heart,”
 she repeated
 firmly. He caught her to him and
4911𓀴kissed her, but it
 seemed to him even
 then as if he held something dead
4912𓀴in his arms, something which by
 no beat of the heart, by no single
4913𓀴spiritual response, met
 his. She gave him her lips.
4914𓀴
4915𓀴For a long moment
 he held her, then
 she withdrew herself and moved away
4916𓀴from him. “No more,”
 she said gently.
 “To-night I shall expect you. I
4917𓀴will meet you at the turn of the
 road by the Madonna of the Rocks.”
4918𓀴
4919𓀴She moved with him slowly towards
 the door. “_Voyons!_” she said before
4920𓀴they parted. “Don’t
 hurt her--don’t
 ever tell her--your young wife. She
4921𓀴is too good. A lie
 will cost you nothing.
 And, after all, if it was not
4922𓀴me--it would be some other woman
 soon--would it not? After all--” Her
4923𓀴voice faltered. Something in her
 wavered for a moment, something very
4924𓀴hard and deep, tried
 suddenly to melt.
 “After all,” said Léon gravely,
4925𓀴“this is the greatest
 proof I have
 to give. Take it as generously as I
4926𓀴give it!”
4927𓀴
4928𓀴She looked at him
 with strange eyes.
 “We are both about to be very
4929𓀴generous, are we
 not?” she said with
 a dry little smile. “_Eh bien!_
4930𓀴Love is short and
 marriage is long--all
 the better for love--which sees
4931𓀴its end.”
4932𓀴
4933𓀴Léon did not like
 this point of view.
 There was some truth in it, no
4934𓀴doubt, but it would have sounded
 better from the lips of a man. He
4935𓀴kissed her hands
 reproachfully. He
 could not think for the moment of
4936𓀴anything very beautiful
 to say about
 love, and Madame herself said no
4937𓀴more. She simply looked
 suggestively at the door.
4938𓀴
4939𓀴After he had gone she stood where
 he had left her, clenching and
4940𓀴unclenching her
 small, firm hands.
4941𓀴
4942𓀴“From my heart,” she whispered,
 “_Mon Dieu_--it appears so--from my
4943𓀴heart.”
4944𓀴
4945𓀴
4946𓀴                  
            CHAPTER XII
4947𓀴
4948𓀴Rose was finishing
 a letter to Agatha
 on the balcony. She found it
4949𓀴difficult to write
 to her sisters,
 they seemed so very far away.
4950𓀴
4951𓀴She was afraid, too,
 that they might
 find her letters dull. You couldn’t
4952𓀴go on describing the blue grotto;
 besides, neither Agatha nor Edith
4953𓀴cared for descriptions
 of scenery,
 they always skipped them in books;
4954𓀴and as far as Rose
 could tell nobody
 played any particular game in
4955𓀴Capri. Young men
 shot birds on Sunday
 afternoons when they could, but
4956𓀴they weren’t even
 the proper birds
 to shoot, so perhaps it was better
4957𓀴not to mention them.
4958𓀴
4959𓀴When Rose wrote to her people she
 always said “we” even when she was
4960𓀴referring to things that
 she did by herself.
4961𓀴
4962𓀴It wasn’t very like
 a Pinsent to give
 way to this illicit expansion of
4963𓀴fact, but Rose comforted herself
 by thinking that after all, editors
4964𓀴said “we” when there was only one
 of them writing, and most of the
4965𓀴married people she knew expressed
 themselves in the plural, though that
4966𓀴perhaps was because
 they really did
 the things together. Still, she went
4967𓀴on writing “we”
 because she didn’t
 want her people to think anything
4968𓀴funny about Léon.
 She had just got
 as far as “We have such jolly little
4969𓀴dinners in the garden,” when she
 heard Léon’s whistle coming up the
4970𓀴stairs. He stood looking
 at her a little curiously.
4971𓀴
4972𓀴“You are writing,” he asked
 her, “to your people?”
4973𓀴
4974𓀴“To Agatha,” she said.
 “Have you any message?”
4975𓀴
4976𓀴Léon sometimes sent
 very amusing messages
 to Agatha. For a moment Léon
4977𓀴did not reply, then he said, “And
 what do you say to them--of me--your
4978𓀴people?”
4979𓀴
4980𓀴Rose blushed, just
 the same wonderful
 pink tulip blush Léon had from the
4981𓀴first particularly
 admired, but it
 was ill-timed, it looked guilty. It
4982𓀴shot through his
 uneasy mind that she
 had been complaining of him to the
4983𓀴Pinsents. In his
 irritable, resentful
 state it gave him a sudden sense
4984𓀴of justification. Hadn’t he done
 already wonders for Rose? He had not
4985𓀴made open love to
 Elise (until just
 now, of course), he had borne for
4986𓀴over a month the ennui of Capri.
 He hadn’t so much as been to a café
4987𓀴without his wife, and now he had
 almost decided not to leave her!
4988𓀴
4989𓀴“Tell them,” he said
 bitterly, “that
 you are perfect, and that I am a
4990𓀴monster of depravity. Almost all
 wives say that to their relatives
4991𓀴sooner or later. You, it appears,
 have taken up the tone in good time!”
4992𓀴
4993𓀴“Léon!” she cried,
 aghast. And then,
 because she loved him so, because
4994𓀴she had shielded
 him in the defiance
 of truth, because she had never had
4995𓀴a suspicion of his faithlessness,
 she chose this moment to say the only
4996𓀴harsh thing she had
 ever said to him.
 “I think,” she said, turning away
4997𓀴her eyes, “that you are
 guilty of very bad taste.”
4998𓀴
4999𓀴It was, of course,
 the one fatal reproach
 to make to a Frenchman. If she
5000𓀴had said he was
 guilty of anything
 else he would have forgiven her.
5001𓀴
5002𓀴Léon rushed into their room, his
 cheeks on fire as if she had struck
5003𓀴him. It was clear
 she no longer loved
 him! Coldly, cruelly, with her
5004𓀴horrible English justice, so out
 of place in a woman, she had thrown
5005𓀴this stone at his
 heart! There could
 be but one issue now. He must go to
5006𓀴Naples. She complained
 of him to her
 parents and she had accused him of
5007𓀴bad taste! He packed
 a small bag feverishly.
 The door between them was
5008𓀴shut.
5009𓀴
5010𓀴Rose hesitated. Should she open
 it and tell him she was sorry?
5011𓀴
5012𓀴What would Agatha or Edith do, if
 they were there? Probably they would
5013𓀴have burst open the
 door with shouts
 of glee, and inserted a cake of
5014𓀴soap down Léon’s back, but this
 happy method of conciliation seemed
5015𓀴closed to Rose. She had never had
 their robuster gift of horseplay. She
5016𓀴got up hesitatingly
 and walked slowly
 away, out into the garden and
5017𓀴beyond the gates
 to post her letter.
 Perhaps when she came back for
5018𓀴dinner she might have
 thought of something
 nice to say, something that
5019𓀴would show Léon she was sorry
 and not aggravate him.
5020𓀴
5021𓀴It was a lovely evening.
 She wandered
 on, seeing at every fresh turn of
5022𓀴the road a yet more
 glorious view.
5023𓀴
5024𓀴The great bay spread
 before her like
 an endless liquid flame. The color
5025𓀴seemed to throb upon
 its burnished shield.
5026𓀴
5027𓀴Naples lay beyond
 it, a long pearly
 circle in the evening light, pale
5028𓀴cream and coral
 pink and soft, dull
 gold. Above Vesuvius the white plume
5029𓀴of smoke drove straight as a
 lifted feather up into the sky.
5030𓀴
5031𓀴She went on till she reached the
 Madonna of the Rocks, then she sat
5032𓀴under the tall raised
 figure with its lamp.
5033𓀴
5034𓀴At the turn of the road below her
 a little carriage was standing; in it
5035𓀴was the figure of
 a woman in white.
 The figure reminded her of Madame
5036𓀴Gérard, only it
 could not be Madame
 Gérard, of course, because Madame
5037𓀴had written to Rose
 that she was not
 well and could not leave her room.
5038𓀴
5039𓀴As Rose sat there
 her eyes filled with
 tears. They were not for herself,
5040𓀴though her own heart was sore;
 they were for the poor woman whose
5041𓀴husband had so cruelly
 left her all
 alone on her honeymoon. And when
5042𓀴Rose thought how happy
 she was herself,
 and how soon she would tell
5043𓀴Léon, with her cheek
 against his cheek,
 that she was sorry she had been
5044𓀴horrid, her heart ached for that
 other bride who had no lover to
5045𓀴appease; and who must be looking
 at all this great sparkling sea and
5046𓀴wonderful bright earth with such
 sad, different eyes! And so Rose sat
5047𓀴there and cried for
 Madame Gérard--and
 Madame Gérard, two hundred yards
5048𓀴away, waited for Rose’s husband.
5049𓀴
5050𓀴He came at last,
 hurriedly, quietly,
 with hanging head, like a thief. He
5051𓀴was ashamed, ashamed
 of his anger against
 Rose, of his incredible folly,
5052𓀴of his silly, intemperate
 desires.
 He passed close by the rock on which
5053𓀴Rose sat. Her heart
 moved suddenly
 against her side; it betrayed her;
5054𓀴stubbornly it beat
 as if it knew itself
 in danger, and yet, Rose said to
5055𓀴herself, there was
 no danger. It was
 only Léon hurrying by, looking as
5056𓀴if he were ashamed.
5057𓀴
5058𓀴She saw him get into
 the little carriage,
 and then turn and look back.
5059𓀴She could not see
 his face, but it
 seemed to her as if he were reluctant
5060𓀴to be driven away. Of course
 he would be back for dinner.
5061𓀴
5062𓀴Perhaps, after all,
 that was Madame
 Gérard, and Léon was driving her
5063𓀴down to the eight o’clock
 boat? Probably
 she was going to Naples to join
5064𓀴her husband, and Léon had offered
 to see her off. He would be very late
5065𓀴for dinner. If she
 hadn’t been cross
 he would have told her what he
5066𓀴meant to do. The
 little Capri ponies
 plunged forward and the carriage
5067𓀴disappeared in a cloud of dust. A
 long while after she saw the little
5068𓀴steamer pushing
 its way across the
 crystal sea and leaving behind it a
5069𓀴long purple trail. She watched
 it till it lost itself beyond
5070𓀴Castellamare. Léon
 would soon be back
 now. She walked slowly towards the
5071𓀴hotel and when she got there she
 was conscious of something strange
5072𓀴about it. The Padrone
 met her with
 a bunch of flowers, and the stout
5073𓀴Padrona bustled
 out from the office
 to ask Rose if there wasn’t anything
5074𓀴extra she would like--would
 she not dine now in the garden?
5075𓀴
5076𓀴“Oh, no, not now,”
 Rose said quickly.
 “I will wait for my husband.” A
5077𓀴shadow passed over
 the Padrona’s face.
 She hesitated and then said with
5078𓀴urgent kindness, “The Signora has
 only to ask for anything she wants.”
5079𓀴The waiter, too, looked at Rose
 with strange, sympathetic eyes. He
5080𓀴suggested her feeding
 the pigeons,
 and hurried to offer her new bread
5081𓀴off the table of some
 traveling Germans.
5082𓀴
5083𓀴“These people,”
 he said, “Tedeschi
 will not know the difference. Take
5084𓀴it, Signora mia, for your birds.”
5085𓀴
5086𓀴The pigeons had already
 gone to roost.
5087𓀴
5088𓀴Peppina, the chambermaid,
 watched Rose
 from the balcony. She should have
5089𓀴been at her supper, but she stood
 for some time gazing down into the
5090𓀴garden at the figure of the young
 wife. Suddenly she also bethought
5091𓀴herself of something
 and hurried down
 into the garden carrying a black
5092𓀴kitten in her apron
 which she deposited
 on Rose’s lap. “Behold,” she
5093𓀴said, “the little one of fortune.
 A black cat brings luck. Talk to it,
5094𓀴Signora, perhaps
 it will stay with
 you.” But the black kitten jumped off
5095𓀴Rose’s lap. It wanted
 to play with
 its own shadow in the grass, and to
5096𓀴stalk birds. It was
 not too young for that.
5097𓀴
5098𓀴The sky changed slowly
 from rose color
 to a clear, pale blue. One by one
5099𓀴the stars came out, but they made
 no place in the sky, till the evening
5100𓀴waned and night came, velvety and
 black, to Capri, embracing it like a
5101𓀴dropped mantle, and then, through
 the curtain of the mysterious dark,
5102𓀴the stars grew enormous and shone
 down upon the scented lemon gardens
5103𓀴and over the vague wide sea.
5104𓀴
5105𓀴Outside the gate
 a mandolin struck
 up a hungry, empty little tune.
5106𓀴
5107𓀴Rose shivered and moved back into
 the house. She could not bear the
5108𓀴beauty of the garden
 any more alone.
5109𓀴
5110𓀴The Padrona met her with a letter
 in her hand. She had had it for two
5111𓀴hours, but she could
 not make up her
 mind to give it to Rose. “How,” she
5112𓀴asked her husband, “am I to slay
 happiness?--I am not a butcher.”
5113𓀴
5114𓀴“Signora,” she said
 nervously, “here
 is a little letter--it is doubtless
5115𓀴from the Signore. He is perhaps
 detained--hospitable
 friends have kept
5116𓀴him--” Rose held out her hand for
 the letter. The Pinsents never made
5117𓀴fusses. They didn’t
 believe in bad
 things happening, and when they
5118𓀴happened they tried to look
 as if they weren’t bad.
5119𓀴
5120𓀴This was the way Rose looked now.
 She smiled pleasantly at the Padrona,
5121𓀴and moved slowly away towards her
 room with the letter. She would not
5122𓀴hurry.
5123𓀴
5124𓀴The Padrona gazed compassionately
 after her. “She is walking over a
5125𓀴precipice,” said the
 Padrona to herself,
 “as if it were a path in our
5126𓀴garden, Poverina!”
5127𓀴
5128𓀴It was a very short letter.
5129𓀴
5130𓀴“My dear,” Léon wrote in French,
 “I find I must go to Naples. It will
5131𓀴not be for long
 I leave you, and I
 have told them all to look after you
5132𓀴until my return.
 Forgive me. Léon.”
5133𓀴
5134𓀴After all he could
 not lie to Rose.
5135𓀴
5136𓀴She read his letter
 three times. The
 first two times she translated his
5137𓀴letter into English,
 and wondered why
 Léon had gone to Naples. The third
5138𓀴time she read it
 without translating
 it, and then she knew everything.
5139𓀴She knew everything
 in all the world.
5140𓀴
5141𓀴But she could not
 quite believe it.
 The arrogance in her rose up and
5142𓀴fought against the truth.
5143𓀴
5144𓀴Rose had very little
 arrogance, but
 all women who have been loved must
5145𓀴have some. Surely
 he who was so much
 her lover could not have left her
5146𓀴so soon?
5147𓀴
5148𓀴She remembered that
 when she had said
 to her mother, “But I could never
5149𓀴leave Léon,” Mrs.
 Pinsent had made
 no direct response. Her mother had
5150𓀴realized that that
 wasn’t the only
 question. How had she realized this?
5151𓀴Had her father ever--?
 Rose buried
 her face in her hands and wept
5152𓀴bitterly. “Oh, poor
 mother!” she murmured,
 “poor mother!” She could not
5153𓀴see herself as wholly poor yet.
5154𓀴
5155𓀴And then she remembered
 Léon’s face
 as he passed her, his sad, ashamed
5156𓀴face, and she knew now why he had
 left her; but that he did not want to
5157𓀴leave her.
5158𓀴
5159𓀴She sat up very straight
 and stopped
 crying when she realized this.
5160𓀴
5161𓀴She thought it very
 strange, for she
 knew quite well that Madame Gérard
5162𓀴didn’t love Léon,
 either. She loved
 her own husband, Rose had seen this;
5163𓀴she knew it as if it were
 in the multiplication
 table; but she couldn’t
5164𓀴think of Madame Gérard now, she
 wasn’t her business. Léon was her
5165𓀴business. She must
 understand, why
 he had done this thing. It wasn’t any
5166𓀴use being silly and just crying,
 then it might happen again, and it
5167𓀴should never happen
 again; she wasn’t
 going to have Léon looking ashamed
5168𓀴twice.
5169𓀴
5170𓀴From the first what
 wrung her heart
 was that Léon would feel it so! He
5171𓀴had meant to be such
 a help, he nearly
 had been, and if he hadn’t been
5172𓀴wasn’t it because Rose had failed
 him? She hadn’t meant to fail him of
5173𓀴course, she had meant
 just the opposite;
 but that was before she knew
5174𓀴all about everything, and before
 you know how to mean, meaning isn’t
5175𓀴going to be much of a help.
5176𓀴
5177𓀴She had thought Léon was strong.
 He wasn’t strong, but in the rush of
5178𓀴her passionate reasoning
 she carried
 this feather-weight of disadvantage
5179𓀴into the fathomless
 sea of her love
 and left it safely there. No, he
5180𓀴wasn’t strong--but he
 was Léon--he was hers.
5181𓀴
5182𓀴It was she who should
 have realized
 his weakness. She remembered now
5183𓀴that once or twice lately he had
 turned back from his excursions with
5184𓀴Madame to suggest
 that Rose should
 join them, but she had refused in her
5185𓀴foolish pride because
 she had wanted
 to prove to him how magnanimous she
5186𓀴was. She shouldn’t have done that
 at all, she shouldn’t have had any
5187𓀴pride--and it didn’t
 matter in the
 least whether she was magnanimous or
5188𓀴not! She should have held him to
 her by whatever could have kept him
5189𓀴there. Tears, if tears
 were necessary;
 pity, duty, pleading--anything
5190𓀴and everything that
 would have helped him.
5191𓀴
5192𓀴She had been thinking of what he
 would think of her--not of what he
5193𓀴needed in her! She
 saw now it only
 mattered what he thought of her in so
5194𓀴far as it helped her to save him.
 Her magnanimity hadn’t saved him.
5195𓀴Something less beautiful but more
 practical might have saved him, her
5196𓀴just being, for instance,
 a little more there.
5197𓀴
5198𓀴But he hadn’t lied
 to her, she came
 back to that as if it was something
5199𓀴on which her heart
 might rest. Ah!
 if he had done that she would have
5200𓀴known that he no
 longer loved her!
5201𓀴
5202𓀴But he had given
 her no reason--no
 excuse; he had flung his sin before
5203𓀴her because he was
 ashamed, because
 he wanted his soul to be naked in
5204𓀴her sight--because he knew
 that she would never fail him.
5205𓀴
5206𓀴In the dark she
 caught sight of the
 hovering Peppina. “Signora,” Peppina
5207𓀴pleaded, “will you not dine?”
5208𓀴
5209𓀴Rose stood up. “Yes,” she said in
 a voice that sounded strange. “Yes,
5210𓀴please, I will dine.”
5211𓀴
5212𓀴The Pinsents always dined.
5213𓀴
5214𓀴“Tell the Padrona,”
 Rose said steadily,
 “that the Signore has had to go
5215𓀴to Naples on business. He
 will not return to-night.”
5216𓀴
5217𓀴Peppina still hovered.
 “Si Signora,”
 she said, “and the black cat, the
5218𓀴one I brought to
 the Signora earlier
 in the evening, he has found for
5219𓀴himself the room of
 the Signora. Behold,
 he lies there curled-up on her
5220𓀴bed. He is there
 now--a miracle! The
 Signora remembers that I told her
5221𓀴‘a black cat means
 good fortune’?”
5222𓀴
5223𓀴Rose hurried into
 the room, and found
 him. He was not quite so good as
5224𓀴her fox terrier at home, but he
 was a comfort. She buried her cheek
5225𓀴against the round black ball of
 the fortunate kitten, and wept with
5226𓀴easier tears.
5227𓀴
5228𓀴Then she went down and had
 her dinner in the garden.
5229𓀴
5230𓀴
5231𓀴                   
           CHAPTER XIII
5232𓀴
5233𓀴They sat on a terrace overlooking
 the most beautiful view in the world.
5234𓀴They did not look at it, nor did
 they look at each other. They were
5235𓀴beautifully dressed,
 they lived in
 the same world and spoke the same
5236𓀴tongue; they would
 have laughed at,
 if they would not have made, the
5237𓀴same jokes. The materials
 for happiness
 were heaped before them; but
5238𓀴neither of them stretched
 out a hand
 to take them. They were both like
5239𓀴creatures under an invisible ban.
5240𓀴
5241𓀴It could not be
 said that Léon had
 any cause for a grievance. Madame
5242𓀴Gérard had given him what she had
 offered him, but he had fatally
5243𓀴under-estimated how far this gift
 would fall short of what he wanted.
5244𓀴
5245𓀴From the moment
 of their departure
 from Capri it had come over him that
5246𓀴Elise was not beautiful, that she
 had no particular charm of person nor
5247𓀴of mind; she neither touched nor
 soothed him. There was a fatal
5248𓀴alteration in her.
 She was accessible.
5249𓀴
5250𓀴Léon could not tell
 what had caused
 this change in his feelings--he had
5251𓀴been covered so lightly
 by a rare and
 perfect tenderness that he had not
5252𓀴realized how it warmed
 and nourished
 him, until he found himself sharply
5253𓀴deprived of it.
5254𓀴
5255𓀴He felt like some
 one suddenly pushed
 into the dark. He fumbled and
5256𓀴knocked himself
 against obstacles,
 possessed by an intolerable fear, a
5257𓀴fear that he shouldn’t
 get out, shouldn’t
 ever get back into his light
5258𓀴again. He knew now what the light
 was, he had been in relation to
5259𓀴perfect purity, and it was not
 until the relation ceased that he
5260𓀴realized it had not left
 him as it found him.
5261𓀴
5262𓀴He no longer wanted
 anything less.
 He wanted only his flawless jewel,
5263𓀴the deep and incorruptible
 heart of
 Rose. And as for the first time he
5264𓀴knew the hunger of a real desire,
 he knew also that he shrank from
5265𓀴returning to her after
 so light and base a sin.
5266𓀴
5267𓀴He had thought this
 three days could
 be nothing, an episode, a chance
5268𓀴wayside plucking of
 a flower, something
 that he could quite easily put
5269𓀴away from him and forget
 on his return to Rose.
5270𓀴
5271𓀴He now discovered
 that it would burn
 into his heart like a corrosive
5272𓀴fluid, and make him fear to seek
 her presence. It was not that he
5273𓀴doubted Rose would forgive him;
 but he came up against something in
5274𓀴himself which would
 not yield forgiveness.
 He had too easily gone wrong.
5275𓀴
5276𓀴He kept his eyes
 carefully away from
 Madame Gérard. He hated her with a
5277𓀴cold antagonism;
 he could not make
 love to her. He fell back on a
5278𓀴sharpened irony of
 attention. She should
 have all that she wanted and he
5279𓀴waited upon her
 with an exaggerated
 courtesy; but she was as oblivious
5280𓀴of his coldness as she
 had been of his warmth.
5281𓀴
5282𓀴Léon had never known
 so strange a woman.
5283𓀴
5284𓀴As for Madame Gérard,
 she had effected
 her purpose. Last night at the
5285𓀴Opera, seated in
 the front of a box
 with Léon beside her, she had caught
5286𓀴and held the eyes of
 her enraged husband.
 That was what she had come to
5287𓀴Naples for.
5288𓀴
5289𓀴Léon had not seen
 him. Monsieur Gérard
 sufficiently accompanied to feel
5290𓀴that a scene would have been out
 of place, had swiftly withdrawn.
5291𓀴
5292𓀴But before he had withdrawn, his
 eyes had crossed swords with his
5293𓀴wife’s.
5294𓀴
5295𓀴After that there
 seemed very little
 to do. She was conscious that the
5296𓀴rest of her life lay before her,
 and that her husband would never
5297𓀴forgive her. The prospect once
 accepted, ceased to stimulate.
5298𓀴
5299𓀴From time to time
 she was conscious
 of Léon, but never as a
5300𓀴consideration requiring
 much effort.
 She had fulfilled her bargain and
5301𓀴nothing more seemed
 to be asked of
 her. She felt with relief that rather
5302𓀴less was required
 of her than might
 have been expected, and she was
5303𓀴vaguely grateful to Léon for
 leaving her so much alone.
5304𓀴
5305𓀴He was a man of tact
 and could be trusted
 to look out her trains for her
5306𓀴and see her eventually
 back to France.
 She supposed she would have
5307𓀴sooner or later to
 rejoin her parents;
 but she wished she could forget
5308𓀴what she had done to Rose.
5309𓀴
5310𓀴Now that her purpose
 was accomplished
 this fact became more and more
5311𓀴troublesome to her. Léon she had
 no qualms about, for she realized
5312𓀴neither his unhappiness
 nor what she
 had cost him, but she did realize
5313𓀴Rose.
5314𓀴
5315𓀴It made her a little
 sharp with Léon
 when she thought of him at all; but
5316𓀴it was quite easy
 not to think of him.
5317𓀴
5318𓀴Madame Gérard wanted to ask him
 if he had succeeded in keeping Rose
5319𓀴unaware, but she
 shrank from speaking
 of Rose. Neither of them spoke of
5320𓀴her, and neither
 of them thought of
 anything else. It made the silence
5321𓀴heavy between them.
5322𓀴
5323𓀴“You would like something to eat
 or drink, perhaps?” Léon at length
5324𓀴roused himself to ask her.
 “No,” she said, “thank you.”
5325𓀴
5326𓀴He lit a cigarette and smoked it
 through, then he said, “It is, I
5327𓀴believe, considered
 very beautiful
 to drive to Posilippo in the
5328𓀴sunset--to dine out
 there and return.
 Shall I order a carriage?”
5329𓀴
5330𓀴She turned her head
 for a brief moment
 and glanced at him. She wished he
5331𓀴would go away now--drive
 to Posilippo
 by himself, for instance. “Do as
5332𓀴you like,” she said
 without stirring,
 “I stay here--” “Then, of course,”
5333𓀴he said gravely, “I shall not
 leave you.” It was like being in
5334𓀴prison--and not being quite sure
 whether you were the prisoner or the
5335𓀴jailer.
5336𓀴
5337𓀴It was a relief to know that some
 one else was advancing along the
5338𓀴terrace. Léon sprang to his feet;
 he was not a clumsy man, but he very
5339𓀴nearly upset the table
 by which they sat.
5340𓀴
5341𓀴Rose was walking
 slowly towards them.
 She held a Baedeker in one hand
5342𓀴and a parasol in
 the other. She was
 very tall, and she looked taller
5343𓀴than usual. Her wide
 blue eyes rested
 on the wonderful sea beyond--but
5344𓀴she had seen Léon
 and Madame Gérard.
 She walked towards them without
5345𓀴speaking or smiling.
5346𓀴
5347𓀴When she came up
 to them she smiled
 a little nervously, but in a very
5348𓀴friendly way, as
 if she was glad to
 see them both, but didn’t want, of
5349𓀴course, to make a fuss about it.
5350𓀴
5351𓀴“They told me,” she said, “that
 I should find you out here.”
5352𓀴
5353𓀴Madame Gérard could not rise. Her
 lips moved as if she tried to speak,
5354𓀴but she dared not
 speak. This was her
 judgment. She was the cleverest of
5355𓀴women, but she no longer
 knew what to say.
5356𓀴
5357𓀴Léon stood there with his eyes on
 the ground, white as a sheet and
5358𓀴trembling. He could
 not look at Rose
 at all. He felt as if her eyes were
5359𓀴fire from Heaven.
5360𓀴
5361𓀴Rose spoke again.
 “Léon,” she said,
 “do you think I might have some
5362𓀴tea?”
5363𓀴
5364𓀴“_Mon Dieu_--Rose--” he whispered
 under his breath. “_Mon Dieu_--what
5365𓀴must you think--”
5366𓀴
5367𓀴“If I could have some
 roll and butter,
 too,” she went on, ignoring his
5368𓀴murmur, “it would be very nice. I
 am rather hungry.” Léon turned and
5369𓀴without speaking
 passed quickly into
 the house. Rose sat down opposite
5370𓀴Madame and put the
 Baedeker on the
 table. Madame Gérard lifted her heavy
5371𓀴eyelids and looked at Rose.
5372𓀴
5373𓀴She did not know what was coming,
 but she meant whatever came--scorn,
5374𓀴anger or contempt--to take it.
5375𓀴
5376𓀴She was not sure what Rose
 wanted--she waited to be sure.
5377𓀴
5378𓀴Rose met her eyes
 with a grave and
 infinitely kindly look. “I am so
5379𓀴sorry,” she said slowly
 in her hesitating
 French. “We meant to help you,
5380𓀴but I’m afraid we didn’t.”
5381𓀴
5382𓀴Madame drew a quick breath, she
 had not expected this. It had not
5383𓀴occurred to her
 that Rose would be
 sorry; that hard, stubborn substance
5384𓀴that was in her
 breast melted once
 and for all towards Rose. The tears
5385𓀴filled her eyes and fell
 slowly into her lap.
5386𓀴
5387𓀴“My dear,” she said,
 “no one could
 help me, and I have not even--helped
5388𓀴myself.”
5389𓀴
5390𓀴“I was stupid,” Rose
 went on gently,
 “and I didn’t understand; but I do
5391𓀴understand now. What
 I wanted to say
 before Léon comes back was, that I
5392𓀴_know_ he meant
 not to make things
 worse. You _will_ forgive him, won’t
5393𓀴you, because it was
 my fault really.
 If I had understood, you see, I
5394𓀴should have known
 he couldn’t help
 you--not in that way--and I think I
5395𓀴could have stopped him.”
5396𓀴
5397𓀴Madame Gérard nodded.
 “I have nothing
 to forgive your husband,” she
5398𓀴said, choosing her
 words carefully.
 “He has done me no great wrong;
5399𓀴always I knew where
 his heart was--it
 is still there, Madame--it is in
5400𓀴your hands. I--”
 said Madame Gérard,
 looking away from Rose’s pitying,
5401𓀴tender eyes--“have what
 I deserve. I have nothing.”
5402𓀴
5403𓀴The waiter came
 with the tea. Léon
 returned at the same time. He could
5404𓀴not keep away, and
 yet it seemed to
 him as if there had never been less
5405𓀴of him anywhere--his
 self-respect,
 his manhood had left him.
5406𓀴
5407𓀴Rose turned to him,
 and with a little
 gesture of perfect tenderness and
5408𓀴trust she slipped
 her hand over his.
 It was as if she gave him back his
5409𓀴soul. He drew himself
 up--strength
 passed into him. She had come back,
5410𓀴she was his--somehow
 or other she was
 there to save him, and at least he
5411𓀴could be generous--he
 could let himself
 be saved. He no longer cared
5412𓀴that he must be a
 poor figure in her
 sight, and he forgot that there was
5413𓀴any other sight but hers.
5414𓀴
5415𓀴She withdrew her
 hand again and went
 on very slowly, still in French,
5416𓀴including him in the conversation
 with a little wave of the hand.
5417𓀴
5418𓀴“I have just,” she said to Madame
 Gérard, “been talking to Monsieur
5419𓀴Gérard. He thinks I have improved
 very much in my French.”
5420𓀴
5421𓀴“My husband!” Madame
 cried, starting
 forward, then she sank back,
5422𓀴white-lipped and trembling.
5423𓀴
5424𓀴“Yes,” said Rose, “I went to see
 him. I found him in the Baedeker. He
5425𓀴was in the sixth
 hotel I called at.”
5426𓀴
5427𓀴“But why,” began
 Madame Gérard, “why
 did you seek him--Madame, what did
5428𓀴you say to him? Forgive
 me, I do not understand?”
5429𓀴
5430𓀴“I thought perhaps
 I had better see
 him first,” Rose explained. “I saw
5431𓀴him in the hall.
 I think he was in
 a kind of rage--he said he had seen
5432𓀴you last night at a theater with
 Léon, and I said, yes--that I never
5433𓀴went to theaters in Italy because
 I didn’t understand the language, and
5434𓀴then he asked me if I had
 been with you all the time.”
5435𓀴
5436𓀴Madame Gérard held her breath.
 Her eyes seemed like a prayer.
5437𓀴
5438𓀴Rose turned to Léon.
 “I’m afraid I
 didn’t tell him the truth,” she said
5439𓀴hesitatingly. “I
 hope it wasn’t very
 dreadful--I said, yes, of course I
5440𓀴had.”
5441𓀴
5442𓀴“You lied to him!” gasped
 Léon. “Then--then--”
 for the first time he
5443𓀴looked at Madame
 Gérard. She covered
 her face with her hands. Rose
5444𓀴looked a little perturbed.
 “I didn’t
 know,” she said, “what else there
5445𓀴was to be done. Of course I know
 it was very wrong. I never have been
5446𓀴untruthful before.
 I--I don’t like
 telling lies, but I thought--I’d
5447𓀴better. So I said
 we were all together.
 I was a little afraid he
5448𓀴mightn’t believe me or that he
 might ask me where we were, but he
5449𓀴didn’t. He quite
 believed me. He only
 asked me what I wanted to see him
5450𓀴for.”
5451𓀴
5452𓀴“_Par exemple_,” muttered
 Léon; “he asked you that?”
5453𓀴
5454𓀴Rose poured herself
 out a second cup
 of tea. “I said,” she went on, “I
5455𓀴came because I thought you might
 be sorry for leaving your wife all
5456𓀴alone--just because
 she tried to turn
 over your music for you--and that
5457𓀴I thought perhaps
 you might be wanting
 to tell her so--and not know
5458𓀴where she was.”
5459𓀴
5460𓀴Madame’s eyes fell from her face.
 “But yes--” she whispered, “and what
5461𓀴did he say, Raoul, when
 you asked him that?”
5462𓀴
5463𓀴There was a new look in her eyes
 now, and a little color in her pale
5464𓀴cheeks.
5465𓀴
5466𓀴“He said he _was_
 sorry,” said Rose,
 gently. “He said he never would
5467𓀴have behaved like that, and never
 meant to--it was only the music, he
5468𓀴said, he often lost his head over
 music, and that that afternoon he had
5469𓀴felt how great a
 success his marriage
 was--so that it was doubly
5470𓀴unfortunate. He said he wanted
 to come back to you very much.”
5471𓀴
5472𓀴There was a moment’s
 pause. Madame
 Gérard’s voice was quite different
5473𓀴when she spoke now,
 there was hope
 in it. “And what answer did you give
5474𓀴him, Madame?” she said. “I think
 I can see by your eyes that you gave
5475𓀴him an answer.”
5476𓀴
5477𓀴Rose nodded. “I told him--I had
 a feeling that you would forgive
5478𓀴him--and that I would ask you,
 if you did, to send him a line
5479𓀴to-night--saying if you would see
 him, and where, of course! You see I
5480𓀴didn’t know where you were at the
 time--but I found you quite easily,
5481𓀴because I had remembered
 something
 that Léon had said to me about this
5482𓀴special view.”
5483𓀴
5484𓀴Léon buried his head
 in his hands and
 laughed wildly. He laughed to save
5485𓀴himself from tears.
 Madame Gérard said
 nothing at all; but she stretched
5486𓀴out her hand for the tea Rose had
 poured out for her and began to drink
5487𓀴it.
5488𓀴
5489𓀴Rose ate two rolls
 and a half. “I’m
 afraid you’ll think I’m dreadfully
5490𓀴greedy,” she explained,
 “but I haven’t
 had any lunch, or any breakfast
5491𓀴either, properly.”
5492𓀴
5493𓀴“But I,” said Léon, coming from
 behind his hands, “I cannot meet
5494𓀴Monsieur Gérard to-morrow?”
5495𓀴
5496𓀴“No,” said Rose, “but
 I left my luggage
 on the Quay. There is a boat
5497𓀴that goes to Venice to-night, and
 I thought,” she murmured with a
5498𓀴diffident, disarming smile, “that
 perhaps you wouldn’t mind if we just
5499𓀴went to Venice, Léon.
 It would be more gay.”

5783𓀴Section 2. Information about the
 Mission of Project Gutenberg™
5784𓀴
5785𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous
 with the free distribution of
5786𓀴electronic works
 in formats readable
 by the widest variety of
5787𓀴computers including
 obsolete, old,
 middle-aged and new computers. It
5788𓀴exists because of the efforts of
 hundreds of volunteers and donations
5789𓀴from people in all walks of life.
5790𓀴
5791𓀴Volunteers and financial support
 to provide volunteers with the
5792𓀴assistance they need are critical
 to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
5793𓀴goals and ensuring
 that the Project
 Gutenberg™ collection will
5794𓀴remain freely available
 for generations
 to come. In 2001, the Project
5795𓀴Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation
 was created to provide a secure
5796𓀴and permanent future for Project
 Gutenberg™ and future
5797𓀴generations. To learn more about
 the Project Gutenberg Literary
5798𓀴Archive Foundation and how your
 efforts and donations can help, see

5816𓀴Section 4. Information
 about Donations
 to the Project Gutenberg
5817𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
5818𓀴
5819𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 depends upon and
 cannot survive without widespread
5820𓀴public support and donations
 to carry out its mission of
5821𓀴increasing the number
 of public domain
 and licensed works that can be
5822𓀴freely distributed
 in machine-readable
 form accessible by the widest
5823𓀴array of equipment
 including outdated
 equipment. Many small donations
5824𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly
 important to maintaining tax exempt
5825𓀴status with the IRS.
5826𓀴
5827𓀴The Foundation is committed to
 complying with the laws regulating
5828𓀴charities and charitable
 donations
 in all 50 states of the United
5829𓀴States. Compliance requirements
 are not uniform and it takes a
5830𓀴considerable effort,
 much paperwork
 and many fees to meet and keep up
5831𓀴with these requirements. We do
 not solicit donations in locations
5832𓀴where we have not
 received written
 confirmation of compliance. To SEND
5833𓀴DONATIONS or determine
 the status of
 compliance for any particular state
5834𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
5835𓀴
5836𓀴While we cannot
 and do not solicit
 contributions from states where we
5837𓀴have not met the solicitation
 requirements,
 we know of no prohibition
5838𓀴against accepting
 unsolicited donations
 from donors in such states who
5839𓀴approach us with
 offers to donate.
5840𓀴
5841𓀴International donations
 are gratefully
 accepted, but we cannot make
5842𓀴any statements concerning
 tax treatment
 of donations received from
5843𓀴outside the United States. U.S.
 laws alone swamp our small staff.
5844𓀴
5845𓀴Please check the
 Project Gutenberg
 web pages for current donation
5846𓀴methods and addresses. Donations
 are accepted in a number of other
5847𓀴ways including checks,
 online payments
 and credit card donations. To

 Information About
 Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
5851𓀴
5852𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was
 the originator of the Project
5853𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library
 of electronic works that could be
5854𓀴freely shared with anyone. For
 forty years, he produced and
5855𓀴distributed Project
 Gutenberg™ eBooks
 with only a loose network of
5856𓀴volunteer support.
5857𓀴
5858𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 eBooks are often
 created from several printed
5859𓀴editions, all of
 which are confirmed
 as not protected by copyright in
5860𓀴the U.S. unless
 a copyright notice
 is included. Thus, we do not
5861𓀴necessarily keep
 eBooks in compliance
 with any particular paper
5862𓀴edition.
5863𓀴
5864𓀴Most people start at our website
 which has the main PG search
5865𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
5866𓀴
5867𓀴This website includes information
 about Project Gutenberg™,
5868𓀴including how to make donations
 to the Project Gutenberg Literary
5869𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help
 produce our new eBooks, and how to
