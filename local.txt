81𓀴Mr. Sherlock Holmes
82𓀴
83𓀴
84𓀴      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was
 usually very late in the mornings,
85𓀴      save upon those
 not infrequent
 occasions when he was up all
86𓀴      night, was seated
 at the breakfast
 table. I stood upon the
87𓀴      hearth-rug and picked up the
 stick which our visitor had left
88𓀴      behind him the night before.
 It was a fine, thick piece of wood,
89𓀴      bulbous-headed,
 of the sort which
 is known as a “Penang lawyer.”
90𓀴      Just under the head was a
 broad silver band nearly an inch
91𓀴      across. “To James Mortimer,
 M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
92𓀴      C.C.H.,” was
 engraved upon it,
 with the date “1884.” It was just
93𓀴      such a stick
 as the old-fashioned
 family practitioner used to
94𓀴      carry—dignified,
 solid, and reassuring.
95𓀴
96𓀴      “Well, Watson, what
 do you make of it?”
97𓀴
98𓀴      Holmes was sitting with his
 back to me, and I had given him no
99𓀴      sign of my occupation.
100𓀴
101𓀴      “How did you know what I was
 doing? I believe you have eyes in
102𓀴      the back of your head.”
103𓀴
104𓀴      “I have, at least,
 a well-polished,
 silver-plated coffee-pot in
105𓀴      front of me,” said he. “But,
 tell me, Watson, what do you make of
106𓀴      our visitor’s
 stick? Since we
 have been so unfortunate as to miss
107𓀴      him and have
 no notion of his
 errand, this accidental souvenir
108𓀴      becomes of
 importance. Let me
 hear you reconstruct the man by an
109𓀴      examination of it.”
110𓀴
111𓀴      “I think,” said I, following
 as far as I could the methods of my
112𓀴      companion,
 “that Dr. Mortimer
 is a successful, elderly medical
113𓀴      man, well-esteemed
 since those
 who know him give him this mark of
114𓀴      their appreciation.”
115𓀴
116𓀴      “Good!” said
 Holmes. “Excellent!”
117𓀴
118𓀴      “I think also
 that the probability
 is in favour of his being a
119𓀴      country practitioner
 who does
 a great deal of his visiting on
120𓀴      foot.”
121𓀴
122𓀴      “Why so?”
123𓀴
124𓀴      “Because this stick, though
 originally a very handsome one has
125𓀴      been so knocked about that
 I can hardly imagine a town
126𓀴      practitioner
 carrying it. The
 thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so
127𓀴      it is evident
 that he has done
 a great amount of walking with
128𓀴      it.”
129𓀴
130𓀴      “Perfectly sound!”
 said Holmes.
131𓀴
132𓀴      “And then again,
 there is the
 ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should
133𓀴      guess that
 to be the Something
 Hunt, the local hunt to whose
134𓀴      members he
 has possibly given
 some surgical assistance, and which
135𓀴      has made him a small
 presentation in return.”
136𓀴
137𓀴      “Really, Watson,
 you excel yourself,”
 said Holmes, pushing back
138𓀴      his chair and
 lighting a cigarette.
 “I am bound to say that in
139𓀴      all the accounts
 which you have
 been so good as to give of my own
140𓀴      small achievements you have
 habitually underrated your own
141𓀴      abilities.
 It may be that you
 are not yourself luminous, but you
142𓀴      are a conductor
 of light. Some
 people without possessing genius
143𓀴      have a remarkable power of
 stimulating it. I confess, my dear
144𓀴      fellow, that I am
 very much in your debt.”
145𓀴
146𓀴      He had never
 said as much before,
 and I must admit that his words
147𓀴      gave me keen pleasure, for
 I had often been piqued by his
148𓀴      indifference
 to my admiration
 and to the attempts which I had
149𓀴      made to give
 publicity to his
 methods. I was proud, too, to think
150𓀴      that I had so far mastered
 his system as to apply it in a way
151𓀴      which earned his approval.
 He now took the stick from my hands
152𓀴      and examined
 it for a few minutes
 with his naked eyes. Then with
153𓀴      an expression of interest
 he laid down his cigarette, and
154𓀴      carrying the
 cane to the window,
 he looked over it again with a
155𓀴      convex lens.
156𓀴
157𓀴      “Interesting,
 though elementary,”
 said he as he returned to his
158𓀴      favourite corner
 of the settee.
 “There are certainly one or two
159𓀴      indications upon the stick.
 It gives us the basis for several
160𓀴      deductions.”
161𓀴
162𓀴      “Has anything escaped me?” I
 asked with some self-importance. “I
163𓀴      trust that there is nothing
 of consequence which I have
164𓀴      overlooked?”
165𓀴
166𓀴      “I am afraid,
 my dear Watson,
 that most of your conclusions were
167𓀴      erroneous. When I said that
 you stimulated me I meant, to be
168𓀴      frank, that in noting your
 fallacies I was occasionally guided
169𓀴      towards the truth. Not that
 you are entirely wrong in this
170𓀴      instance. The
 man is certainly
 a country practitioner. And he
171𓀴      walks a good deal.”
172𓀴
173𓀴      “Then I was right.”
174𓀴
175𓀴      “To that extent.”
176𓀴
177𓀴      “But that was all.”
178𓀴
179𓀴      “No, no, my dear Watson,
 not all—by no means all. I would
180𓀴      suggest, for example, that
 a presentation to a doctor is more
181𓀴      likely to come
 from a hospital
 than from a hunt, and that when
182𓀴      the initials
 ‘C.C.’ are placed
 before that hospital the words
183𓀴      ‘Charing Cross’
 very naturally
 suggest themselves.”
184𓀴
185𓀴      “You may be right.”
186𓀴
187𓀴      “The probability
 lies in that
 direction. And if we take this as a
188𓀴      working hypothesis we have a
 fresh basis from which to start our
189𓀴      construction of
 this unknown visitor.”
190𓀴
191𓀴      “Well, then, supposing that
 ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing
192𓀴      Cross Hospital,’
 what further
 inferences may we draw?”
193𓀴
194𓀴      “Do none suggest themselves?
 You know my methods. Apply them!”
195𓀴
196𓀴      “I can only
 think of the obvious
 conclusion that the man has
197𓀴      practised in town before
 going to the country.”
198𓀴
199𓀴      “I think that
 we might venture
 a little farther than this. Look
200𓀴      at it in this light. On what
 occasion would it be most probable
201𓀴      that such a
 presentation would
 be made? When would his friends
202𓀴      unite to give
 him a pledge of
 their good will? Obviously at the
203𓀴      moment when Dr. Mortimer
 withdrew from the service of the
204𓀴      hospital in order to start a
 practice for himself. We know there
205𓀴      has been a presentation. We
 believe there has been a change from
206𓀴      a town hospital to a country
 practice. Is it, then, stretching
207𓀴      our inference too far to say
 that the presentation was on the
208𓀴      occasion of the change?”
209𓀴
210𓀴      “It certainly
 seems probable.”
211𓀴
212𓀴      “Now, you will
 observe that he
 could not have been on the _staff_
213𓀴      of the hospital, since only
 a man well-established in a London
214𓀴      practice could hold such a
 position, and such a one would not
215𓀴      drift into the country. What
 was he, then? If he was in the
216𓀴      hospital and yet not on the
 staff he could only have been a
217𓀴      house-surgeon or
 a house-physician—little
 more than a senior
218𓀴      student. And
 he left five years
 ago—the date is on the stick. So
219𓀴      your grave,
 middle-aged family
 practitioner vanishes into thin
220𓀴      air, my dear
 Watson, and there
 emerges a young fellow under
221𓀴      thirty, amiable,
 unambitious,
 absent-minded, and the possessor of
222𓀴      a favourite
 dog, which I should
 describe roughly as being larger
223𓀴      than a terrier and
 smaller than a mastiff.”
224𓀴
225𓀴      I laughed incredulously as
 Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his
226𓀴      settee and blew
 little wavering
 rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
227𓀴
228𓀴      “As to the
 latter part, I have
 no means of checking you,” said I,
229𓀴      “but at least
 it is not difficult
 to find out a few particulars
230𓀴      about the man’s
 age and professional
 career.” From my small
231𓀴      medical shelf
 I took down the
 Medical Directory and turned up the
232𓀴      name. There were
 several Mortimers,
 but only one who could be our
233𓀴      visitor. I read
 his record aloud.
234𓀴
235𓀴        “Mortimer,
 James, M.R.C.S.,
 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
236𓀴        House-surgeon, from 1882
 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
237𓀴        Winner of
 the Jackson prize
 for Comparative Pathology, with
238𓀴        essay entitled ‘Is Disease
 a Reversion?’  Corresponding member
239𓀴        of the Swedish
 Pathological
 Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of
240𓀴        Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).
  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of
241𓀴        Psychology_, March, 1883).
 Medical Officer for the parishes of
242𓀴        Grimpen, Thorsley,
 and High Barrow.”
243𓀴
244𓀴      “No mention of that local
 hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a
245𓀴      mischievous smile,
 “but a country
 doctor, as you very astutely
246𓀴      observed. I think
 that I am fairly
 justified in my inferences. As
247𓀴      to the adjectives, I said,
 if I remember right, amiable,
248𓀴      unambitious,
 and absent-minded.
 It is my experience that it is
249𓀴      only an amiable
 man in this world
 who receives testimonials, only
250𓀴      an unambitious
 one who abandons
 a London career for the country,
251𓀴      and only an
 absent-minded one
 who leaves his stick and not his
252𓀴      visiting-card after waiting
 an hour in your room.”
253𓀴
254𓀴      “And the dog?”
255𓀴
256𓀴      “Has been in
 the habit of carrying
 this stick behind his master.
257𓀴      Being a heavy stick the dog
 has held it tightly by the middle,
258𓀴      and the marks of his teeth
 are very plainly visible. The dog’s
259𓀴      jaw, as shown
 in the space between
 these marks, is too broad in
260𓀴      my opinion for a terrier and
 not broad enough for a mastiff. It
261𓀴      may have been—yes, by Jove,
 it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”
262𓀴
263𓀴      He had risen
 and paced the room
 as he spoke. Now he halted in the
264𓀴      recess of the window. There
 was such a ring of conviction in his
265𓀴      voice that I glanced
 up in surprise.
266𓀴
267𓀴      “My dear fellow, how can
 you possibly be so sure of that?”
268𓀴
269𓀴      “For the very simple reason
 that I see the dog himself on our
270𓀴      very door-step, and there is
 the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I
271𓀴      beg you, Watson.
 He is a professional
 brother of yours, and your
272𓀴      presence may
 be of assistance
 to me. Now is the dramatic moment
273𓀴      of fate, Watson,
 when you hear
 a step upon the stair which is
274𓀴      walking into
 your life, and you
 know not whether for good or ill.
275𓀴      What does Dr.
 James Mortimer,
 the man of science, ask of Sherlock
276𓀴      Holmes, the specialist
 in crime? Come in!”
277𓀴
278𓀴      The appearance
 of our visitor
 was a surprise to me, since I had
279𓀴      expected a typical
 country practitioner.
 He was a very tall, thin
280𓀴      man, with a long nose like a
 beak, which jutted out between two
281𓀴      keen, grey eyes, set closely
 together and sparkling brightly from
282𓀴      behind a pair of gold-rimmed
 glasses. He was clad in a
283𓀴      professional
 but rather slovenly
 fashion, for his frock-coat was
284𓀴      dingy and his
 trousers frayed.
 Though young, his long back was
285𓀴      already bowed, and he walked
 with a forward thrust of his head
286𓀴      and a general air of peering
 benevolence. As he entered his eyes
287𓀴      fell upon the
 stick in Holmes’s
 hand, and he ran towards it with
288𓀴      an exclamation of joy. “I am
 so very glad,” said he. “I was not
289𓀴      sure whether I had left it
 here or in the Shipping Office. I
290𓀴      would not lose that
 stick for the world.”
291𓀴
292𓀴      “A presentation,
 I see,” said Holmes.
293𓀴
294𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
295𓀴
296𓀴      “From Charing
 Cross Hospital?”
297𓀴
298𓀴      “From one or
 two friends there
 on the occasion of my marriage.”
299𓀴
300𓀴      “Dear, dear, that’s bad!”
 said Holmes, shaking his head.
301𓀴
302𓀴      Dr. Mortimer blinked through
 his glasses in mild astonishment.
303𓀴      “Why was it bad?”
304𓀴
305𓀴      “Only that you
 have disarranged
 our little deductions. Your
306𓀴      marriage, you say?”
307𓀴
308𓀴      “Yes, sir. I married, and so
 left the hospital, and with it all
309𓀴      hopes of a consulting
 practice.
 It was necessary to make a home
310𓀴      of my own.”
311𓀴
312𓀴      “Come, come, we are not so
 far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.
313𓀴      “And now, Dr.
 James Mortimer—”
314𓀴
315𓀴      “Mister, sir, Mister—a
 humble M.R.C.S.”
316𓀴
317𓀴      “And a man of precise
 mind, evidently.”
318𓀴
319𓀴      “A dabbler in
 science, Mr. Holmes,
 a picker up of shells on the
320𓀴      shores of the great unknown
 ocean. I presume that it is Mr.
321𓀴      Sherlock Holmes whom
 I am addressing and not—”
322𓀴
323𓀴      “No, this is my
 friend Dr. Watson.”
324𓀴
325𓀴      “Glad to meet you, sir. I
 have heard your name mentioned in
326𓀴      connection with that of your
 friend. You interest me very much,
327𓀴      Mr. Holmes. I
 had hardly expected
 so dolichocephalic a skull or
328𓀴      such well-marked
 supra-orbital
 development. Would you have any
329𓀴      objection to
 my running my finger
 along your parietal fissure? A
330𓀴      cast of your
 skull, sir, until
 the original is available, would
331𓀴      be an ornament
 to any anthropological
 museum. It is not my
332𓀴      intention to be fulsome, but
 I confess that I covet your skull.”
333𓀴
334𓀴      Sherlock Holmes
 waved our strange
 visitor into a chair. “You are
335𓀴      an enthusiast
 in your line of
 thought, I perceive, sir, as I am
336𓀴      in mine,” said
 he. “I observe
 from your forefinger that you make
337𓀴      your own cigarettes. Have
 no hesitation in lighting one.”
338𓀴
339𓀴      The man drew
 out paper and tobacco
 and twirled the one up in the
340𓀴      other with surprising
 dexterity.
 He had long, quivering fingers
341𓀴      as agile and restless
 as the antennæ of an insect.
342𓀴
343𓀴      Holmes was silent,
 but his little
 darting glances showed me the
344𓀴      interest which he took in
 our curious companion. “I presume,
345𓀴      sir,” said he at last, “that
 it was not merely for the purpose of
346𓀴      examining my skull that you
 have done me the honour to call here
347𓀴      last night and again today?”
348𓀴
349𓀴      “No, sir, no;
 though I am happy
 to have had the opportunity of
350𓀴      doing that as well. I came
 to you, Mr. Holmes, because I
351𓀴      recognized that I am myself
 an unpractical man and because I am
352𓀴      suddenly confronted with
 a most serious and extraordinary
353𓀴      problem. Recognizing, as I
 do, that you are the second highest
354𓀴      expert in Europe—”
355𓀴
356𓀴      “Indeed, sir! May I inquire
 who has the honour to be the first?”
357𓀴      asked Holmes
 with some asperity.
358𓀴
359𓀴      “To the man of
 precisely scientific
 mind the work of Monsieur
360𓀴      Bertillon must always
 appeal strongly.”
361𓀴
362𓀴      “Then had you not
 better consult him?”
363𓀴
364𓀴      “I said, sir,
 to the precisely
 scientific mind. But as a
365𓀴      practical man
 of affairs it is
 acknowledged that you stand alone.
366𓀴      I trust, sir, that
 I have not inadvertently—”
367𓀴
368𓀴      “Just a little,”
 said Holmes.
 “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would
369𓀴      do wisely if
 without more ado
 you would kindly tell me plainly
370𓀴      what the exact nature of the
 problem is in which you demand my
371𓀴      assistance.”

377𓀴The Curse of the Baskervilles
378𓀴
379𓀴
380𓀴      “I have in my
 pocket a manuscript,”
 said Dr. James Mortimer.
381𓀴
382𓀴      “I observed
 it as you entered
 the room,” said Holmes.
383𓀴
384𓀴      “It is an old manuscript.”
385𓀴
386𓀴      “Early eighteenth century,
 unless it is a forgery.”
387𓀴
388𓀴      “How can you say that, sir?”
389𓀴
390𓀴      “You have presented an inch
 or two of it to my examination all
391𓀴      the time that you have been
 talking. It would be a poor expert
392𓀴      who could not give the date
 of a document within a decade or so.
393𓀴      You may possibly
 have read my
 little monograph upon the subject.
394𓀴      I put that at 1730.”
395𓀴
396𓀴      “The exact date is 1742.”
 Dr. Mortimer drew it from his
397𓀴      breast-pocket.
 “This family paper
 was committed to my care by Sir
398𓀴      Charles Baskerville, whose
 sudden and tragic death some three
399𓀴      months ago created so much
 excitement in Devonshire. I may say
400𓀴      that I was
 his personal friend
 as well as his medical attendant.
401𓀴      He was a strong-minded man,
 sir, shrewd, practical, and as
402𓀴      unimaginative
 as I am myself.
 Yet he took this document very
403𓀴      seriously, and his mind was
 prepared for just such an end as did
404𓀴      eventually overtake him.”
405𓀴
406𓀴      Holmes stretched
 out his hand
 for the manuscript and flattened it
407𓀴      upon his knee.
 “You will observe,
 Watson, the alternative use of
408𓀴      the long _s_ and the short.
 It is one of several indications
409𓀴      which enabled
 me to fix the date.”
410𓀴
411𓀴      I looked over his shoulder
 at the yellow paper and the faded
412𓀴      script. At the
 head was written:
 “Baskerville Hall,” and below in
413𓀴      large, scrawling
 figures: “1742.”
414𓀴
415𓀴      “It appears to be
 a statement of some sort.”
416𓀴
417𓀴      “Yes, it is a statement of
 a certain legend which runs in the
418𓀴      Baskerville family.”
419𓀴
420𓀴      “But I understand that it is
 something more modern and practical
421𓀴      upon which you
 wish to consult me?”
422𓀴
423𓀴      “Most modern.
 A most practical,
 pressing matter, which must be
424𓀴      decided within
 twenty-four hours.
 But the manuscript is short and
425𓀴      is intimately connected with
 the affair. With your permission I
426𓀴      will read it to you.”
427𓀴
428𓀴      Holmes leaned
 back in his chair,
 placed his finger-tips together,
429𓀴      and closed his eyes, with an
 air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer
430𓀴      turned the manuscript to the
 light and read in a high, cracking
431𓀴      voice the following curious,
 old-world narrative:
432𓀴
433𓀴        “Of the origin
 of the Hound
 of the Baskervilles there have been
434𓀴        many statements, yet as
 I come in a direct line from Hugo
435𓀴        Baskerville, and as I had
 the story from my father, who also
436𓀴        had it from
 his, I have set
 it down with all belief that it
437𓀴        occurred even as is here
 set forth. And I would have you
438𓀴        believe, my sons, that the
 same Justice which punishes sin may
439𓀴        also most
 graciously forgive
 it, and that no ban is so heavy
440𓀴        but that by
 prayer and repentance
 it may be removed.  Learn
441𓀴        then from this story not
 to fear the fruits of the past, but
442𓀴        rather to be circumspect
 in the future, that those foul
443𓀴        passions
 whereby our family
 has suffered so grievously may not
444𓀴        again be loosed
 to our undoing.
445𓀴
446𓀴            “Know then that in the
 time of the Great Rebellion (the
447𓀴            history of which by
 the learned Lord Clarendon I most
448𓀴            earnestly commend
 to your attention) this Manor of
449𓀴            Baskerville was held
 by Hugo of that name, nor can it be
450𓀴            gainsaid that he was a
 most wild, profane, and godless man.
451𓀴             This, in
 truth, his neighbours
 might have pardoned, seeing
452𓀴            that saints have never
 flourished in those parts, but there
453𓀴            was in
 him a certain wanton
 and cruel humour which made his
454𓀴            name a by-word through
 the West.  It chanced that this Hugo
455𓀴            came to
 love (if, indeed,
 so dark a passion may be known
456𓀴            under
 so bright a name)
 the daughter of a yeoman who held
457𓀴            lands
 near the Baskerville
 estate. But the young maiden,
458𓀴            being discreet and of
 good repute, would ever avoid him,
459𓀴            for she
 feared his evil
 name.  So it came to pass that one
460𓀴            Michaelmas this Hugo,
 with five or six of his idle and
461𓀴            wicked
 companions, stole
 down upon the farm and carried off
462𓀴            the maiden, her father
 and brothers being from home, as he
463𓀴            well knew.  When they
 had brought her to the Hall the
464𓀴            maiden
 was placed in an
 upper chamber, while Hugo and his
465𓀴            friends sat down to a
 long carouse, as was their nightly
466𓀴            custom.  Now, the poor
 lass upstairs was like to have her
467𓀴            wits turned
 at the singing
 and shouting and terrible oaths
468𓀴            which came up to her
 from below, for they say that the
469𓀴            words used
 by Hugo Baskerville,
 when he was in wine, were
470𓀴            such
 as might blast the
 man who said them.  At last in the
471𓀴            stress of her fear she
 did that which might have daunted
472𓀴            the bravest or most
 active man, for by the aid of the
473𓀴            growth
 of ivy which covered
 (and still covers) the south
474𓀴            wall
 she came down from
 under the eaves, and so homeward
475𓀴            across the moor, there
 being three leagues betwixt the Hall
476𓀴            and her father’s farm.
477𓀴
478𓀴            “It chanced that some
 little time later Hugo left his
479𓀴            guests to carry food
 and drink—with other worse things,
480𓀴            perchance—to
 his captive,
 and so found the cage empty and
481𓀴            the bird
 escaped.  Then,
 as it would seem, he became as one
482𓀴            that
 hath a devil, for,
 rushing down the stairs into the
483𓀴            dining-hall, he sprang
 upon the great table, flagons and
484𓀴            trenchers
 flying before
 him, and he cried aloud before all
485𓀴            the company
 that he would
 that very night render his body
486𓀴            and soul to the Powers
 of Evil if he might but overtake the
487𓀴            wench.  And
 while the revellers
 stood aghast at the fury of
488𓀴            the man,
 one more wicked
 or, it may be, more drunken than
489𓀴            the rest,
 cried out that
 they should put the hounds upon
490𓀴            her.  Whereat Hugo ran
 from the house, crying to his grooms
491𓀴            that
 they should saddle
 his mare and unkennel the pack, and
492𓀴            giving
 the hounds a kerchief
 of the maid’s, he swung them
493𓀴            to the
 line, and so off
 full cry in the moonlight over the
494𓀴            moor.
495𓀴
496𓀴            “Now,
 for some space the
 revellers stood agape, unable to
497𓀴            understand
 all that had
 been done in such haste.  But anon
498𓀴            their
 bemused wits awoke
 to the nature of the deed which
499𓀴            was like
 to be done upon
 the moorlands.  Everything was now
500𓀴            in an
 uproar, some calling
 for their pistols, some for
501𓀴            their horses, and some
 for another flask of wine.  But at
502𓀴            length some sense came
 back to their crazed minds, and the
503𓀴            whole
 of them, thirteen
 in number, took horse and started
504𓀴            in pursuit.
  The moon shone
 clear above them, and they rode
505𓀴            swiftly
 abreast, taking
 that course which the maid must
506𓀴            needs have taken if
 she were to reach her own home.
507𓀴
508𓀴            “They had gone a mile
 or two when they passed one of the
509𓀴            night
 shepherds upon the
 moorlands, and they cried to him
510𓀴            to know if he had seen
 the hunt.  And the man, as the story
511𓀴            goes,
 was so crazed with
 fear that he could scarce speak,
512𓀴            but at
 last he said that
 he had indeed seen the unhappy
513𓀴            maiden,
 with the hounds
 upon her track.  ‘But I have seen
514𓀴            more than that,’ said
 he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me
515𓀴            upon
 his black mare, and
 there ran mute behind him such a
516𓀴            hound of hell as God
 forbid should ever be at my heels.’
517𓀴            So the drunken squires
 cursed the shepherd and rode onward.
518𓀴             But soon their skins
 turned cold, for there came a
519𓀴            galloping
 across the moor,
 and the black mare, dabbled with
520𓀴            white froth, went past
 with trailing bridle and empty
521𓀴            saddle.
  Then the revellers
 rode close together, for a
522𓀴            great
 fear was on them,
 but they still followed over the
523𓀴            moor, though each, had
 he been alone, would have been right
524𓀴            glad
 to have turned his
 horse’s head.  Riding slowly in
525𓀴            this fashion they came
 at last upon the hounds.  These,
526𓀴            though known for their
 valour and their breed, were
527𓀴            whimpering
 in a cluster
 at the head of a deep dip or goyal,
528𓀴            as we
 call it, upon the
 moor, some slinking away and some,
529𓀴            with starting hackles
 and staring eyes, gazing down the
530𓀴            narrow
 valley before them.
531𓀴
532𓀴            “The
 company had come to
 a halt, more sober men, as you may
533𓀴            guess, than when they
 started.  The most of them would by
534𓀴            no means
 advance, but three
 of them, the boldest, or it may
535𓀴            be the
 most drunken, rode
 forward down the goyal. Now, it
536𓀴            opened
 into a broad space
 in which stood two of those great
537𓀴            stones,
 still to be seen
 there, which were set by certain
538𓀴            forgotten
 peoples in the
 days of old. The moon was shining
539𓀴            bright
 upon the clearing,
 and there in the centre lay the
540𓀴            unhappy maid where she
 had fallen, dead of fear and of
541𓀴            fatigue.
  But it was not
 the sight of her body, nor yet was
542𓀴            it that of the body of
 Hugo Baskerville lying near her,
543𓀴            which raised the hair
 upon the heads of these three
544𓀴            dare-devil roysterers,
 but it was that, standing over Hugo,
545𓀴            and plucking
 at his throat,
 there stood a foul thing, a
546𓀴            great,
 black beast, shaped
 like a hound, yet larger than
547𓀴            any hound
 that ever mortal
 eye has rested upon.  And even
548𓀴            as they looked the
 thing tore the throat out of Hugo
549𓀴            Baskerville, on which,
 as it turned its blazing eyes and
550𓀴            dripping
 jaws upon them,
 the three shrieked with fear and
551𓀴            rode for
 dear life, still
 screaming, across the moor.  One,
552𓀴            it is said, died that
 very night of what he had seen, and
553𓀴            the other
 twain were but
 broken men for the rest of their
554𓀴            days.
555𓀴
556𓀴            “Such is the tale, my
 sons, of the coming of the hound
557𓀴            which is said to have
 plagued the family so sorely ever
558𓀴            since.  If I have set
 it down it is because that which is
559𓀴            clearly
 known hath less
 terror than that which is but
560𓀴            hinted at and guessed.
  Nor can it be denied that many of
561𓀴            the family have been
 unhappy in their deaths, which have
562𓀴            been sudden, bloody,
 and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter
563𓀴            ourselves
 in the infinite
 goodness of Providence, which
564𓀴            would
 not forever punish
 the innocent beyond that third or
565𓀴            fourth
 generation which
 is threatened in Holy Writ.  To
566𓀴            that Providence, my
 sons, I hereby commend you, and I
567𓀴            counsel you by way of
 caution to forbear from crossing the
568𓀴            moor in those dark
 hours when the powers of evil are
569𓀴            exalted.
570𓀴
571𓀴            “[This
 from Hugo Baskerville
 to his sons Rodger and John,
572𓀴            with instructions that
 they say nothing thereof to their
573𓀴            sister Elizabeth.]”
574𓀴
575𓀴      When Dr. Mortimer
 had finished
 reading this singular narrative he
576𓀴      pushed his spectacles
 up on his
 forehead and stared across at Mr.
577𓀴      Sherlock Holmes. The latter
 yawned and tossed the end of his
578𓀴      cigarette into the fire.
579𓀴
580𓀴      “Well?” said he.
581𓀴
582𓀴      “Do you not find
 it interesting?”
583𓀴
584𓀴      “To a collector
 of fairy tales.”
585𓀴
586𓀴      Dr. Mortimer drew a folded
 newspaper out of his pocket.
587𓀴
588𓀴      “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will
 give you something a little more
589𓀴      recent. This
 is the _Devon County
 Chronicle_ of May 14th of this
590𓀴      year. It is
 a short account of
 the facts elicited at the death of
591𓀴      Sir Charles
 Baskerville which
 occurred a few days before that
592𓀴      date.”
593𓀴
594𓀴      My friend leaned a little
 forward and his expression became
595𓀴      intent. Our
 visitor readjusted
 his glasses and began:
596𓀴
597𓀴        “The recent
 sudden death of
 Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name
598𓀴        has been mentioned as the
 probable Liberal candidate for
599𓀴        Mid-Devon at
 the next election,
 has cast a gloom over the
600𓀴        county. 
 Though Sir Charles
 had resided at Baskerville Hall for
601𓀴        a comparatively
 short period
 his amiability of character and
602𓀴        extreme generosity had won
 the affection and respect of all who
603𓀴        had been brought
 into contact
 with him.  In these days of
604𓀴        _nouveaux riches_
 it is refreshing
 to find a case where the
605𓀴        scion of an
 old county family
 which has fallen upon evil days
606𓀴        is able to
 make his own fortune
 and to bring it back with him
607𓀴        to restore
 the fallen grandeur
 of his line.  Sir Charles, as is
608𓀴        well known, made large
 sums of money in South African
609𓀴        speculation.
 More wise than
 those who go on until the wheel
610𓀴        turns against
 them, he realised
 his gains and returned to
611𓀴        England with them.  It is
 only two years since he took up his
612𓀴        residence
 at Baskerville Hall,
 and it is common talk how large
613𓀴        were those schemes
 of reconstruction
 and improvement which have
614𓀴        been interrupted
 by his death.
  Being himself childless, it was
615𓀴        his openly
 expressed desire
 that the whole countryside should,
616𓀴        within his
 own lifetime, profit
 by his good fortune, and many
617𓀴        will have personal reasons
 for bewailing his untimely end.  His
618𓀴        generous
 donations to local
 and county charities have been
619𓀴        frequently chronicled
 in these columns.
620𓀴
621𓀴            “The circumstances
 connected
 with the death of Sir Charles
622𓀴            cannot be said to have
 been entirely cleared up by the
623𓀴            inquest, but at least
 enough has been done to dispose of
624𓀴            those rumours to which
 local superstition has given rise.
625𓀴            There is
 no reason whatever
 to suspect foul play, or to
626𓀴            imagine
 that death could
 be from any but natural causes.
627𓀴            Sir Charles
 was a widower,
 and a man who may be said to
628𓀴            have been in some ways
 of an eccentric habit of mind. In
629𓀴            spite
 of his considerable
 wealth he was simple in his
630𓀴            personal tastes, and
 his indoor servants at Baskerville
631𓀴            Hall consisted
 of a married
 couple named Barrymore, the
632𓀴            husband
 acting as butler
 and the wife as housekeeper. Their
633𓀴            evidence, corroborated
 by that of several friends, tends to
634𓀴            show
 that Sir Charles’s
 health has for some time been
635𓀴            impaired, and points
 especially to some affection of the
636𓀴            heart, manifesting
 itself in changes of colour,
637𓀴            breathlessness,
 and acute
 attacks of nervous depression.
638𓀴            Dr. James
 Mortimer, the
 friend and medical attendant of the
639𓀴            deceased, has given
 evidence to the same effect.
640𓀴
641𓀴            “The facts of the case
 are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
642𓀴            was in the habit every
 night before going to bed of walking
643𓀴            down the famous yew
 alley of Baskerville Hall.  The
644𓀴            evidence
 of the Barrymores
 shows that this had been his
645𓀴            custom. On the fourth
 of May Sir Charles had declared his
646𓀴            intention of starting
 next day for London, and had ordered
647𓀴            Barrymore
 to prepare his
 luggage.  That night he went out
648𓀴            as usual
 for his nocturnal
 walk, in the course of which he
649𓀴            was in
 the habit of smoking
 a cigar.  He never returned.
650𓀴            At twelve
 o’clock Barrymore,
 finding the hall door still
651𓀴            open, became alarmed,
 and, lighting a lantern, went in
652𓀴            search of his master.
  The day had been wet, and Sir
653𓀴            Charles’s footmarks
 were easily traced down the alley.
654𓀴            Halfway down this walk
 there is a gate which leads out on
655𓀴            to the
 moor. There were
 indications that Sir Charles had
656𓀴            stood for some little
 time here.  He then proceeded down
657𓀴            the alley, and it was
 at the far end of it that his body
658𓀴            was discovered.
 One fact
 which has not been explained is
659𓀴            the statement
 of Barrymore
 that his master’s footprints
660𓀴            altered
 their character
 from the time that he passed the
661𓀴            moor-gate, and that he
 appeared from thence onward to have
662𓀴            been walking upon
 his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy
663𓀴            horse-dealer,
 was on the
 moor at no great distance at the
664𓀴            time,
 but he appears by
 his own confession to have been the
665𓀴            worse for
 drink. He declares
 that he heard cries but is
666𓀴            unable
 to state from what
 direction they came.  No signs of
667𓀴            violence
 were to be discovered
 upon Sir Charles’s person,
668𓀴            and though
 the doctor’s
 evidence pointed to an almost
669𓀴            incredible
 facial distortion—so
 great that Dr. Mortimer
670𓀴            refused
 at first to believe
 that it was indeed his friend
671𓀴            and patient
 who lay before
 him—it was explained that that
672𓀴            is a symptom which is
 not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and
673𓀴            death from
 cardiac exhaustion.
  This explanation was borne
674𓀴            out by the post-mortem
 examination, which showed
675𓀴            long-standing organic
 disease, and the coroner’s jury
676𓀴            returned
 a verdict in accordance
 with the medical evidence.
677𓀴             It is well that this
 is so, for it is obviously of the
678𓀴            utmost importance that
 Sir Charles’s heir should settle at
679𓀴            the Hall
 and continue the
 good work which has been so sadly
680𓀴            interrupted.  Had the
 prosaic finding of the coroner not
681𓀴            finally put an end to
 the romantic stories which have been
682𓀴            whispered
 in connection
 with the affair, it might have been
683𓀴            difficult
 to find a tenant
 for Baskerville Hall.  It is
684𓀴            understood
 that the next
 of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,
685𓀴            if he be still alive,
 the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s
686𓀴            younger brother.  The
 young man when last heard of was in
687𓀴            America, and inquiries
 are being instituted with a view to
688𓀴            informing him
 of his good fortune.”
689𓀴
690𓀴      Dr. Mortimer
 refolded his paper
 and replaced it in his pocket.
691𓀴      “Those are the public facts,
 Mr. Holmes, in connection with the
692𓀴      death of Sir
 Charles Baskerville.”
693𓀴
694𓀴      “I must thank you,” said
 Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my
695𓀴      attention to a
 case which certainly
 presents some features of
696𓀴      interest. I
 had observed some
 newspaper comment at the time, but
697𓀴      I was exceedingly
 preoccupied
 by that little affair of the
698𓀴      Vatican cameos,
 and in my anxiety
 to oblige the Pope I lost touch
699𓀴      with several
 interesting English
 cases. This article, you say,
700𓀴      contains all
 the public facts?”
701𓀴
702𓀴      “It does.”
703𓀴
704𓀴      “Then let me
 have the private
 ones.” He leaned back, put his
705𓀴      finger-tips together,
 and assumed
 his most impassive and judicial
706𓀴      expression.
707𓀴
708𓀴      “In doing so,”
 said Dr. Mortimer,
 who had begun to show signs of
709𓀴      some strong emotion,
 “I am telling
 that which I have not confided
710𓀴      to anyone. My motive for
 withholding it from the coroner’s
711𓀴      inquiry is that
 a man of science
 shrinks from placing himself in
712𓀴      the public
 position of seeming
 to indorse a popular superstition.
713𓀴      I had the further
 motive that
 Baskerville Hall, as the paper
714𓀴      says, would certainly remain
 untenanted if anything were done to
715𓀴      increase its already rather
 grim reputation. For both these
716𓀴      reasons I thought that I was
 justified in telling rather less
717𓀴      than I knew,
 since no practical
 good could result from it, but
718𓀴      with you there is no reason
 why I should not be perfectly frank.
719𓀴
720𓀴      “The moor is very sparsely
 inhabited, and those who live near
721𓀴      each other are
 thrown very much
 together. For this reason I saw a
722𓀴      good deal of Sir
 Charles Baskerville.
 With the exception of Mr.
723𓀴      Frankland, of Lafter Hall,
 and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,
724𓀴      there are no other men of
 education within many miles. Sir
725𓀴      Charles was
 a retiring man, but
 the chance of his illness brought
726𓀴      us together, and a community
 of interests in science kept us so.
727𓀴      He had brought back much
 scientific information from South
728𓀴      Africa, and many a charming
 evening we have spent together
729𓀴      discussing the comparative
 anatomy of the Bushman and the
730𓀴      Hottentot.
731𓀴
732𓀴      “Within the last few months
 it became increasingly plain to me
733𓀴      that Sir Charles’s nervous
 system was strained to the breaking
734𓀴      point. He had
 taken this legend
 which I have read you exceedingly
735𓀴      to heart—so much so that,
 although he would walk in his own
736𓀴      grounds, nothing
 would induce
 him to go out upon the moor at
737𓀴      night. Incredible as it may
 appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was
738𓀴      honestly convinced
 that a dreadful
 fate overhung his family, and
739𓀴      certainly the records which
 he was able to give of his ancestors
740𓀴      were not encouraging. The
 idea of some ghastly presence
741𓀴      constantly haunted him, and
 on more than one occasion he has
742𓀴      asked me whether I had on my
 medical journeys at night ever seen
743𓀴      any strange
 creature or heard
 the baying of a hound. The latter
744𓀴      question he
 put to me several
 times, and always with a voice
745𓀴      which vibrated
 with excitement.
746𓀴
747𓀴      “I can well remember driving
 up to his house in the evening some
748𓀴      three weeks before the fatal
 event. He chanced to be at his hall
749𓀴      door. I had descended from
 my gig and was standing in front of
750𓀴      him, when I saw his eyes fix
 themselves over my shoulder and
751𓀴      stare past me
 with an expression
 of the most dreadful horror. I
752𓀴      whisked round
 and had just time
 to catch a glimpse of something
753𓀴      which I took
 to be a large black
 calf passing at the head of the
754𓀴      drive. So excited
 and alarmed
 was he that I was compelled to go
755𓀴      down to the spot where the
 animal had been and look around for
756𓀴      it. It was
 gone, however, and
 the incident appeared to make the
757𓀴      worst impression upon his
 mind. I stayed with him all the
758𓀴      evening, and it was on that
 occasion, to explain the emotion
759𓀴      which he had shown,
 that he confided
 to my keeping that narrative
760𓀴      which I read
 to you when first
 I came. I mention this small
761𓀴      episode because
 it assumes some
 importance in view of the tragedy
762𓀴      which followed,
 but I was convinced
 at the time that the matter
763𓀴      was entirely trivial and
 that his excitement had no
764𓀴      justification.
765𓀴
766𓀴      “It was at
 my advice that Sir
 Charles was about to go to London.
767𓀴      His heart was,
 I knew, affected,
 and the constant anxiety in
768𓀴      which he lived,
 however chimerical
 the cause of it might be, was
769𓀴      evidently having
 a serious effect
 upon his health. I thought that
770𓀴      a few months among
 the distractions
 of town would send him back a
771𓀴      new man. Mr.
 Stapleton, a mutual
 friend who was much concerned at
772𓀴      his state of
 health, was of the
 same opinion. At the last instant
773𓀴      came this terrible
 catastrophe.
774𓀴
775𓀴      “On the night
 of Sir Charles’s
 death Barrymore the butler, who
776𓀴      made the discovery,
 sent Perkins
 the groom on horseback to me,
777𓀴      and as I was sitting up late
 I was able to reach Baskerville Hall
778𓀴      within an hour of the event.
 I checked and corroborated all the
779𓀴      facts which were mentioned
 at the inquest. I followed the
780𓀴      footsteps down
 the yew alley,
 I saw the spot at the moor-gate
781𓀴      where he seemed
 to have waited,
 I remarked the change in the
782𓀴      shape of the
 prints after that
 point, I noted that there were no
783𓀴      other footsteps
 save those of
 Barrymore on the soft gravel, and
784𓀴      finally I carefully examined
 the body, which had not been touched
785𓀴      until my arrival.
 Sir Charles
 lay on his face, his arms out, his
786𓀴      fingers dug into the ground,
 and his features convulsed with some
787𓀴      strong emotion
 to such an extent
 that I could hardly have sworn
788𓀴      to his identity. There was
 certainly no physical injury of any
789𓀴      kind. But one
 false statement
 was made by Barrymore at the
790𓀴      inquest. He said that there
 were no traces upon the ground round
791𓀴      the body. He did not observe
 any. But I did—some little distance
792𓀴      off, but fresh and clear.”
793𓀴
794𓀴      “Footprints?”
795𓀴
796𓀴      “Footprints.”
797𓀴
798𓀴      “A man’s or a woman’s?”
799𓀴
800𓀴      Dr. Mortimer
 looked strangely
 at us for an instant, and his voice
801𓀴      sank almost to a
 whisper as he answered.
802𓀴
803𓀴      “Mr. Holmes, they were the
 footprints of a gigantic hound!”
804𓀴
805𓀴
806𓀴
807𓀴
808𓀴Chapter 3.
809𓀴The Problem
810𓀴
811𓀴
812𓀴      I confess at
 these words a shudder
 passed through me. There was a
813𓀴      thrill in the doctor’s voice
 which showed that he was himself
814𓀴      deeply moved
 by that which he
 told us. Holmes leaned forward in
815𓀴      his excitement and his eyes
 had the hard, dry glitter which shot
816𓀴      from them when he
 was keenly interested.
817𓀴
818𓀴      “You saw this?”
819𓀴
820𓀴      “As clearly as I see you.”
821𓀴
822𓀴      “And you said nothing?”
823𓀴
824𓀴      “What was the use?”
825𓀴
826𓀴      “How was it that
 no one else saw it?”
827𓀴
828𓀴      “The marks were some twenty
 yards from the body and no one gave
829𓀴      them a thought.
 I don’t suppose
 I should have done so had I not
830𓀴      known this legend.”
831𓀴
832𓀴      “There are many
 sheep-dogs on the moor?”
833𓀴
834𓀴      “No doubt, but
 this was no sheep-dog.”
835𓀴
836𓀴      “You say it was large?”
837𓀴
838𓀴      “Enormous.”
839𓀴
840𓀴      “But it had not
 approached the body?”
841𓀴
842𓀴      “No.”
843𓀴
844𓀴      “What sort of night was it?’
845𓀴
846𓀴      “Damp and raw.”
847𓀴
848𓀴      “But not actually raining?”
849𓀴
850𓀴      “No.”
851𓀴
852𓀴      “What is the alley like?”
853𓀴
854𓀴      “There are two lines of old
 yew hedge, twelve feet high and
855𓀴      impenetrable.
 The walk in the
 centre is about eight feet across.”
856𓀴
857𓀴      “Is there anything between
 the hedges and the walk?”
858𓀴
859𓀴      “Yes, there
 is a strip of grass
 about six feet broad on either
860𓀴      side.”
861𓀴
862𓀴      “I understand
 that the yew hedge
 is penetrated at one point by a
863𓀴      gate?”
864𓀴
865𓀴      “Yes, the wicket-gate
 which leads on to the moor.”
866𓀴
867𓀴      “Is there any
 other opening?”
868𓀴
869𓀴      “None.”
870𓀴
871𓀴      “So that to
 reach the yew alley
 one either has to come down it
872𓀴      from the house or else
 to enter it by the moor-gate?”
873𓀴
874𓀴      “There is an exit through
 a summer-house at the far end.”
875𓀴
876𓀴      “Had Sir Charles
 reached this?”
877𓀴
878𓀴      “No; he lay about
 fifty yards from it.”
879𓀴
880𓀴      “Now, tell me,
 Dr. Mortimer—and
 this is important—the marks which
881𓀴      you saw were on the
 path and not on the grass?”
882𓀴
883𓀴      “No marks could
 show on the grass.”
884𓀴
885𓀴      “Were they on the same side
 of the path as the moor-gate?”
886𓀴
887𓀴      “Yes; they were on the edge
 of the path on the same side as the
888𓀴      moor-gate.”
889𓀴
890𓀴      “You interest
 me exceedingly.
 Another point. Was the wicket-gate
891𓀴      closed?”
892𓀴
893𓀴      “Closed and padlocked.”
894𓀴
895𓀴      “How high was it?”
896𓀴
897𓀴      “About four feet high.”
898𓀴
899𓀴      “Then anyone could
 have got over it?”
900𓀴
901𓀴      “Yes.”
902𓀴
903𓀴      “And what marks did
 you see by the wicket-gate?”
904𓀴
905𓀴      “None in particular.”
906𓀴
907𓀴      “Good heaven!
 Did no one examine?”
908𓀴
909𓀴      “Yes, I examined, myself.”
910𓀴
911𓀴      “And found nothing?”
912𓀴
913𓀴      “It was all
 very confused. Sir
 Charles had evidently stood there
914𓀴      for five or ten minutes.”
915𓀴
916𓀴      “How do you know that?”
917𓀴
918𓀴      “Because the ash had twice
 dropped from his cigar.”
919𓀴
920𓀴      “Excellent!
 This is a colleague,
 Watson, after our own heart. But
921𓀴      the marks?”
922𓀴
923𓀴      “He had left
 his own marks all
 over that small patch of gravel. I
924𓀴      could discern no others.”
925𓀴
926𓀴      Sherlock Holmes struck his
 hand against his knee with an
927𓀴      impatient gesture.
928𓀴
929𓀴      “If I had only been there!”
 he cried. “It is evidently a case of
930𓀴      extraordinary interest,
 and one which presented immense
931𓀴      opportunities
 to the scientific
 expert. That gravel page upon
932𓀴      which I might
 have read so much
 has been long ere this smudged by
933𓀴      the rain and defaced by the
 clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.
934𓀴      Mortimer, Dr.
 Mortimer, to think
 that you should not have called
935𓀴      me in! You have indeed
 much to answer for.”
936𓀴
937𓀴      “I could not
 call you in, Mr.
 Holmes, without disclosing these
938𓀴      facts to the
 world, and I have
 already given my reasons for not
939𓀴      wishing to do
 so. Besides, besides—”
940𓀴
941𓀴      “Why do you hesitate?”
942𓀴
943𓀴      “There is a
 realm in which the
 most acute and most experienced of
944𓀴      detectives is helpless.”
945𓀴
946𓀴      “You mean that the
 thing is supernatural?”
947𓀴
948𓀴      “I did not
 positively say so.”
949𓀴
950𓀴      “No, but you
 evidently think it.”
951𓀴
952𓀴      “Since the tragedy,
 Mr. Holmes,
 there have come to my ears
953𓀴      several incidents which are
 hard to reconcile with the settled
954𓀴      order of Nature.”
955𓀴
956𓀴      “For example?”
957𓀴
958𓀴      “I find that
 before the terrible
 event occurred several people
959𓀴      had seen a creature upon the
 moor which corresponds with this
960𓀴      Baskerville demon, and which
 could not possibly be any animal
961𓀴      known to science. They all
 agreed that it was a huge creature,
962𓀴      luminous, ghastly,
 and spectral.
 I have cross-examined these men,
963𓀴      one of them a hard-headed
 countryman,
 one a farrier, and one a
964𓀴      moorland farmer,
 who all tell
 the same story of this dreadful
965𓀴      apparition, exactly
 corresponding
 to the hell-hound of the
966𓀴      legend. I assure you that
 there is a reign of terror in the
967𓀴      district, and
 that it is a hardy
 man who will cross the moor at
968𓀴      night.”
969𓀴
970𓀴      “And you, a trained man
 of science, believe it to be
971𓀴      supernatural?”
972𓀴
973𓀴      “I do not know
 what to believe.”
974𓀴
975𓀴      Holmes shrugged
 his shoulders.
 “I have hitherto confined my
976𓀴      investigations
 to this world,”
 said he. “In a modest way I have
977𓀴      combated evil,
 but to take on
 the Father of Evil himself would,
978𓀴      perhaps, be too ambitious a
 task. Yet you must admit that the
979𓀴      footmark is material.”
980𓀴
981𓀴      “The original
 hound was material
 enough to tug a man’s throat
982𓀴      out, and yet he
 was diabolical as well.”
983𓀴
984𓀴      “I see that
 you have quite gone
 over to the supernaturalists. But
985𓀴      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me
 this. If you hold these views, why
986𓀴      have you come to consult me
 at all? You tell me in the same
987𓀴      breath that it is useless to
 investigate Sir Charles’s death, and
988𓀴      that you desire
 me to do it.”
989𓀴
990𓀴      “I did not say that
 I desired you to do it.”
991𓀴
992𓀴      “Then, how
 can I assist you?”
993𓀴
994𓀴      “By advising me as to what
 I should do with Sir Henry
995𓀴      Baskerville, who
 arrives at Waterloo
 Station”—Dr. Mortimer looked
996𓀴      at his watch—“in exactly
 one hour and a quarter.”
997𓀴
998𓀴      “He being the heir?”
999𓀴
1000𓀴      “Yes. On the death of Sir
 Charles we inquired for this young
1001𓀴      gentleman and found that he
 had been farming in Canada. From the
1002𓀴      accounts which have reached
 us he is an excellent fellow in every
1003𓀴      way. I speak now not as a
 medical man but as a trustee and
1004𓀴      executor of
 Sir Charles’s will.”
1005𓀴
1006𓀴      “There is no other
 claimant, I presume?”
1007𓀴
1008𓀴      “None. The
 only other kinsman
 whom we have been able to trace was
1009𓀴      Rodger Baskerville,
 the youngest
 of three brothers of whom poor
1010𓀴      Sir Charles
 was the elder. The
 second brother, who died young, is
1011𓀴      the father
 of this lad Henry.
 The third, Rodger, was the black
1012𓀴      sheep of the
 family. He came
 of the old masterful Baskerville
1013𓀴      strain and
 was the very image,
 they tell me, of the family
1014𓀴      picture of
 old Hugo. He made
 England too hot to hold him, fled to
1015𓀴      Central America,
 and died there
 in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is
1016𓀴      the last of
 the Baskervilles.
 In one hour and five minutes I meet
1017𓀴      him at Waterloo Station. I
 have had a wire that he arrived at
1018𓀴      Southampton
 this morning. Now,
 Mr. Holmes, what would you advise
1019𓀴      me to do with him?”
1020𓀴
1021𓀴      “Why should he not go
 to the home of his fathers?”
1022𓀴
1023𓀴      “It seems natural, does it
 not? And yet, consider that every
1024𓀴      Baskerville who goes there
 meets with an evil fate. I feel sure
1025𓀴      that if Sir
 Charles could have
 spoken with me before his death he
1026𓀴      would have
 warned me against
 bringing this, the last of the old
1027𓀴      race, and the heir to great
 wealth, to that deadly place. And yet
1028𓀴      it cannot
 be denied that the
 prosperity of the whole poor, bleak
1029𓀴      countryside
 depends upon his
 presence. All the good work which
1030𓀴      has been done
 by Sir Charles
 will crash to the ground if there is
1031𓀴      no tenant
 of the Hall. I fear
 lest I should be swayed too much by
1032𓀴      my own obvious interest in
 the matter, and that is why I bring
1033𓀴      the case before you
 and ask for your advice.”
1034𓀴
1035𓀴      Holmes considered
 for a little time.
1036𓀴
1037𓀴      “Put into plain words, the
 matter is this,” said he. “In your
1038𓀴      opinion there
 is a diabolical
 agency which makes Dartmoor an
1039𓀴      unsafe abode
 for a Baskerville—that
 is your opinion?”
1040𓀴
1041𓀴      “At least I
 might go the length
 of saying that there is some
1042𓀴      evidence that
 this may be so.”
1043𓀴
1044𓀴      “Exactly.
 But surely, if your
 supernatural theory be correct, it
1045𓀴      could work the young man
 evil in London as easily as in
1046𓀴      Devonshire.
 A devil with merely
 local powers like a parish vestry
1047𓀴      would be too inconceivable
 a thing.”
1048𓀴
1049𓀴      “You put the matter
 more flippantly,
 Mr. Holmes, than you would
1050𓀴      probably do
 if you were brought
 into personal contact with these
1051𓀴      things. Your
 advice, then, as
 I understand it, is that the young
1052𓀴      man will be
 as safe in Devonshire
 as in London. He comes in fifty
1053𓀴      minutes. What
 would you recommend?”
1054𓀴
1055𓀴      “I recommend, sir, that you
 take a cab, call off your spaniel who
1056𓀴      is scratching
 at my front door,
 and proceed to Waterloo to meet
1057𓀴      Sir Henry Baskerville.”
1058𓀴
1059𓀴      “And then?”
1060𓀴
1061𓀴      “And then you
 will say nothing
 to him at all until I have made up
1062𓀴      my mind about the matter.”
1063𓀴
1064𓀴      “How long will it take
 you to make up your mind?”
1065𓀴
1066𓀴      “Twenty-four
 hours. At ten o’clock
 tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will
1067𓀴      be much obliged
 to you if you
 will call upon me here, and it will
1068𓀴      be of help
 to me in my plans
 for the future if you will bring Sir
1069𓀴      Henry Baskerville
 with you.”
1070𓀴
1071𓀴      “I will do so, Mr. Holmes.”
 He scribbled the appointment on his
1072𓀴      shirt-cuff
 and hurried off in
 his strange, peering, absent-minded
1073𓀴      fashion. Holmes stopped
 him at the head of the stair.
1074𓀴
1075𓀴      “Only one
 more question, Dr.
 Mortimer. You say that before Sir
1076𓀴      Charles Baskerville’s death
 several people saw this apparition
1077𓀴      upon the moor?”
1078𓀴
1079𓀴      “Three people did.”
1080𓀴
1081𓀴      “Did any see it after?”
1082𓀴
1083𓀴      “I have not heard of any.”
1084𓀴
1085𓀴      “Thank you. Good-morning.”
1086𓀴
1087𓀴      Holmes returned to his seat
 with that quiet look of inward
1088𓀴      satisfaction
 which meant that
 he had a congenial task before him.
1089𓀴
1090𓀴      “Going out, Watson?”
1091𓀴
1092𓀴      “Unless I can help you.”
1093𓀴
1094𓀴      “No, my dear fellow, it is
 at the hour of action that I turn to
1095𓀴      you for aid.
 But this is splendid,
 really unique from some points
1096𓀴      of view. When
 you pass Bradley’s,
 would you ask him to send up a
1097𓀴      pound of the strongest shag
 tobacco? Thank you. It would be as
1098𓀴      well if you could make it
 convenient not to return before
1099𓀴      evening. Then
 I should be very
 glad to compare impressions as to
1100𓀴      this most
 interesting problem
 which has been submitted to us this
1101𓀴      morning.”
1102𓀴
1103𓀴      I knew that seclusion and
 solitude were very necessary for my
1104𓀴      friend in those
 hours of intense
 mental concentration during
1105𓀴      which he weighed
 every particle
 of evidence, constructed
1106𓀴      alternative
 theories, balanced
 one against the other, and made up
1107𓀴      his mind as to which points
 were essential and which immaterial.
1108𓀴      I therefore
 spent the day at
 my club and did not return to Baker
1109𓀴      Street until
 evening. It was
 nearly nine o’clock when I found
1110𓀴      myself in the
 sitting-room once more.
1111𓀴
1112𓀴      My first impression
 as I opened
 the door was that a fire had
1113𓀴      broken out,
 for the room was
 so filled with smoke that the light
1114𓀴      of the lamp upon the table
 was blurred by it. As I entered,
1115𓀴      however, my
 fears were set at
 rest, for it was the acrid fumes of
1116𓀴      strong coarse tobacco which
 took me by the throat and set me
1117𓀴      coughing.
 Through the haze I
 had a vague vision of Holmes in his
1118𓀴      dressing-gown coiled up in
 an armchair with his black clay pipe
1119𓀴      between his lips. Several
 rolls of paper lay around him.
1120𓀴
1121𓀴      “Caught cold,
 Watson?” said he.
1122𓀴
1123𓀴      “No, it’s this
 poisonous atmosphere.”
1124𓀴
1125𓀴      “I suppose it _is_ pretty
 thick, now that you mention it.”
1126𓀴
1127𓀴      “Thick! It is intolerable.”
1128𓀴
1129𓀴      “Open the window, then! You
 have been at your club all day, I
1130𓀴      perceive.”
1131𓀴
1132𓀴      “My dear Holmes!”
1133𓀴
1134𓀴      “Am I right?”
1135𓀴
1136𓀴      “Certainly, but how?”
1137𓀴
1138𓀴      He laughed at my bewildered
 expression. “There is a delightful
1139𓀴      freshness
 about you, Watson,
 which makes it a pleasure to
1140𓀴      exercise any small powers
 which I possess at your expense. A
1141𓀴      gentleman goes forth on a
 showery and miry day. He returns
1142𓀴      immaculate
 in the evening with
 the gloss still on his hat and his
1143𓀴      boots. He
 has been a fixture
 therefore all day. He is not a man
1144𓀴      with intimate
 friends. Where,
 then, could he have been? Is it not
1145𓀴      obvious?”
1146𓀴
1147𓀴      “Well, it
 is rather obvious.”
1148𓀴
1149𓀴      “The world
 is full of obvious
 things which nobody by any chance
1150𓀴      ever observes. Where do
 you think that I have been?”
1151𓀴
1152𓀴      “A fixture also.”
1153𓀴
1154𓀴      “On the contrary,
 I have been to Devonshire.”
1155𓀴
1156𓀴      “In spirit?”
1157𓀴
1158𓀴      “Exactly. My
 body has remained
 in this armchair and has, I regret
1159𓀴      to observe, consumed in my
 absence two large pots of coffee and
1160𓀴      an incredible
 amount of tobacco.
 After you left I sent down to
1161𓀴      Stamford’s for the Ordnance
 map of this portion of the moor, and
1162𓀴      my spirit has hovered over
 it all day. I flatter myself that I
1163𓀴      could find my way about.”
1164𓀴
1165𓀴      “A large-scale
 map, I presume?”
1166𓀴
1167𓀴      “Very large.”
1168𓀴
1169𓀴      He unrolled one section and
 held it over his knee. “Here you have
1170𓀴      the particular
 district which
 concerns us. That is Baskerville
1171𓀴      Hall in the middle.”
1172𓀴
1173𓀴      “With a wood round it?”
1174𓀴
1175𓀴      “Exactly. I fancy the yew
 alley, though not marked under that
1176𓀴      name, must stretch along
 this line, with the moor, as you
1177𓀴      perceive, upon the right of
 it. This small clump of buildings
1178𓀴      here is the
 hamlet of Grimpen,
 where our friend Dr. Mortimer has
1179𓀴      his headquarters.
 Within a radius
 of five miles there are, as you
1180𓀴      see, only a
 very few scattered
 dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,
1181𓀴      which was mentioned
 in the narrative.
 There is a house indicated
1182𓀴      here which
 may be the residence
 of the naturalist—Stapleton, if I
1183𓀴      remember right,
 was his name.
 Here are two moorland farmhouses,
1184𓀴      High Tor and Foulmire. Then
 fourteen miles away the great convict
1185𓀴      prison of
 Princetown. Between
 and around these scattered points
1186𓀴      extends the
 desolate, lifeless
 moor. This, then, is the stage
1187𓀴      upon which tragedy has been
 played, and upon which we may help to
1188𓀴      play it again.”
1189𓀴
1190𓀴      “It must be a wild place.”
1191𓀴
1192𓀴      “Yes, the
 setting is a worthy
 one. If the devil did desire to
1193𓀴      have a hand in
 the affairs of men—”
1194𓀴
1195𓀴      “Then you are yourself
 inclining to the supernatural
1196𓀴      explanation.”
1197𓀴
1198𓀴      “The devil’s agents may be
 of flesh and blood, may they not?
1199𓀴      There are two
 questions waiting
 for us at the outset. The one is
1200𓀴      whether any crime
 has been committed
 at all; the second is, what
1201𓀴      is the crime and how was
 it committed? Of course, if Dr.
1202𓀴      Mortimer’s surmise should
 be correct, and we are dealing with
1203𓀴      forces outside the ordinary
 laws of Nature, there is an end of
1204𓀴      our investigation. But we
 are bound to exhaust all other
1205𓀴      hypotheses
 before falling back
 upon this one. I think we’ll shut
1206𓀴      that window
 again, if you don’t
 mind. It is a singular thing, but
1207𓀴      I find that a concentrated
 atmosphere helps a concentration of
1208𓀴      thought. I
 have not pushed it
 to the length of getting into a box
1209𓀴      to think, but
 that is the logical
 outcome of my convictions. Have
1210𓀴      you turned the
 case over in your mind?”
1211𓀴
1212𓀴      “Yes, I have thought a good
 deal of it in the course of the day.”
1213𓀴
1214𓀴      “What do you make of it?”
1215𓀴
1216𓀴      “It is very bewildering.”
1217𓀴
1218𓀴      “It has certainly
 a character
 of its own. There are points of
1219𓀴      distinction
 about it. That change
 in the footprints, for example.
1220𓀴      What do you make of that?”
1221𓀴
1222𓀴      “Mortimer said that the man
 had walked on tiptoe down that
1223𓀴      portion of the alley.”
1224𓀴
1225𓀴      “He only repeated what some
 fool had said at the inquest. Why
1226𓀴      should a man walk
 on tiptoe down the alley?”
1227𓀴
1228𓀴      “What then?”
1229𓀴
1230𓀴      “He was running,
 Watson—running
 desperately, running for his
1231𓀴      life, running
 until he burst
 his heart—and fell dead upon his
1232𓀴      face.”
1233𓀴
1234𓀴      “Running from what?”
1235𓀴
1236𓀴      “There lies
 our problem. There
 are indications that the man was
1237𓀴      crazed with fear before
 ever he began to run.”
1238𓀴
1239𓀴      “How can you say that?”
1240𓀴
1241𓀴      “I am presuming
 that the cause
 of his fears came to him across
1242𓀴      the moor. If
 that were so, and
 it seems most probable, only a man
1243𓀴      who had lost his wits would
 have run _from_ the house instead of
1244𓀴      towards it. If
 the gipsy’s evidence
 may be taken as true, he ran
1245𓀴      with cries for
 help in the direction
 where help was least likely
1246𓀴      to be. Then,
 again, whom was
 he waiting for that night, and why
1247𓀴      was he waiting
 for him in the
 yew alley rather than in his own
1248𓀴      house?”
1249𓀴
1250𓀴      “You think that he
 was waiting for someone?”
1251𓀴
1252𓀴      “The man was
 elderly and infirm.
 We can understand his taking an
1253𓀴      evening stroll,
 but the ground
 was damp and the night inclement.
1254𓀴      Is it natural
 that he should
 stand for five or ten minutes, as
1255𓀴      Dr. Mortimer,
 with more practical
 sense than I should have given
1256𓀴      him credit for, deduced
 from the cigar ash?”
1257𓀴
1258𓀴      “But he went
 out every evening.”
1259𓀴
1260𓀴      “I think it unlikely that
 he waited at the moor-gate every
1261𓀴      evening. On the contrary,
 the evidence is that he avoided the
1262𓀴      moor. That night
 he waited there.
 It was the night before he made
1263𓀴      his departure for London.
 The thing takes shape, Watson. It
1264𓀴      becomes coherent.
 Might I ask
 you to hand me my violin, and we
1265𓀴      will postpone all further
 thought upon this business until we
1266𓀴      have had the advantage of
 meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry
1267𓀴      Baskerville
 in the morning.”

1273𓀴Sir Henry Baskerville
1274𓀴
1275𓀴
1276𓀴      Our breakfast
 table was cleared
 early, and Holmes waited in his
1277𓀴      dressing-gown
 for the promised
 interview. Our clients were
1278𓀴      punctual to
 their appointment,
 for the clock had just struck ten
1279𓀴      when Dr. Mortimer was shown
 up, followed by the young baronet.
1280𓀴      The latter
 was a small, alert,
 dark-eyed man about thirty years
1281𓀴      of age, very
 sturdily built,
 with thick black eyebrows and a
1282𓀴      strong, pugnacious face. He
 wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and
1283𓀴      had the weather-beaten
 appearance
 of one who has spent most of
1284𓀴      his time in the open air,
 and yet there was something in his
1285𓀴      steady eye and
 the quiet assurance
 of his bearing which indicated
1286𓀴      the gentleman.
1287𓀴
1288𓀴      “This is Sir
 Henry Baskerville,”
 said Dr. Mortimer.
1289𓀴
1290𓀴      “Why, yes,” said he, “and
 the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock
1291𓀴      Holmes, that
 if my friend here
 had not proposed coming round to
1292𓀴      you this morning I should
 have come on my own account. I
1293𓀴      understand
 that you think out
 little puzzles, and I’ve had one
1294𓀴      this morning
 which wants more
 thinking out than I am able to give
1295𓀴      it.”
1296𓀴
1297𓀴      “Pray take
 a seat, Sir Henry.
 Do I understand you to say that you
1298𓀴      have yourself
 had some remarkable
 experience since you arrived in
1299𓀴      London?”
1300𓀴
1301𓀴      “Nothing of
 much importance,
 Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as
1302𓀴      not. It was this letter,
 if you can call it a letter, which
1303𓀴      reached me this morning.”
1304𓀴
1305𓀴      He laid an
 envelope upon the
 table, and we all bent over it. It
1306𓀴      was of common
 quality, greyish
 in colour. The address, “Sir Henry
1307𓀴      Baskerville, Northumberland
 Hotel,” was printed in rough
1308𓀴      characters; the post-mark
 “Charing Cross,” and the date of
1309𓀴      posting the
 preceding evening.
1310𓀴
1311𓀴      “Who knew
 that you were going
 to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked
1312𓀴      Holmes, glancing keenly
 across at our visitor.
1313𓀴
1314𓀴      “No one could have known.
 We only decided after I met Dr.
1315𓀴      Mortimer.”
1316𓀴
1317𓀴      “But Dr. Mortimer was no
 doubt already stopping there?”
1318𓀴
1319𓀴      “No, I had been staying
 with a friend,” said the doctor.
1320𓀴
1321𓀴      “There was no
 possible indication
 that we intended to go to this
1322𓀴      hotel.”
1323𓀴
1324𓀴      “Hum! Someone seems to be
 very deeply interested in your
1325𓀴      movements.”
 Out of the envelope
 he took a half-sheet of foolscap
1326𓀴      paper folded
 into four. This
 he opened and spread flat upon the
1327𓀴      table. Across the middle of
 it a single sentence had been formed
1328𓀴      by the expedient of pasting
 printed words upon it. It ran:
1329𓀴
1330𓀴        As you value your life or
 your reason keep away from the moor.
1331𓀴
1332𓀴      The word “moor”
 only was printed in ink.
1333𓀴
1334𓀴      “Now,” said Sir
 Henry Baskerville,
 “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
1335𓀴      Holmes, what in thunder is
 the meaning of that, and who it is
1336𓀴      that takes so much
 interest in my affairs?”
1337𓀴
1338𓀴      “What do you
 make of it, Dr.
 Mortimer? You must allow that there
1339𓀴      is nothing supernatural
 about this, at any rate?”
1340𓀴
1341𓀴      “No, sir, but it might very
 well come from someone who was
1342𓀴      convinced that the
 business is supernatural.”
1343𓀴
1344𓀴      “What business?” asked Sir
 Henry sharply. “It seems to me that
1345𓀴      all you gentlemen
 know a great
 deal more than I do about my own
1346𓀴      affairs.”
1347𓀴
1348𓀴      “You shall
 share our knowledge
 before you leave this room, Sir
1349𓀴      Henry. I promise you that,”
 said Sherlock Holmes. “We will
1350𓀴      confine ourselves
 for the present
 with your permission to this
1351𓀴      very interesting
 document, which
 must have been put together and
1352𓀴      posted yesterday
 evening. Have
 you yesterday’s _Times_, Watson?”
1353𓀴
1354𓀴      “It is here in the corner.”
1355𓀴
1356𓀴      “Might I trouble
 you for it—the
 inside page, please, with the
1357𓀴      leading articles?”
 He glanced
 swiftly over it, running his eyes
1358𓀴      up and down
 the columns. “Capital
 article this on free trade.
1359𓀴      Permit me to give
 you an extract from it.
1360𓀴
1361𓀴     ‘You may be cajoled
 into imagining
 that your own special trade or
1362𓀴     your own industry
 will be encouraged
 by a protective tariff, but
1363𓀴     it stands to
 reason that such
 legislation must in the long run
1364𓀴     keep away wealth from the
 country, diminish the value of our
1365𓀴     imports, and
 lower the general
 conditions of life in this island.’
1366𓀴
1367𓀴      “What do you think of that,
 Watson?” cried Holmes in high glee,
1368𓀴      rubbing his hands together
 with satisfaction. “Don’t you think
1369𓀴      that is an admirable
 sentiment?”
1370𓀴
1371𓀴      Dr. Mortimer
 looked at Holmes
 with an air of professional
1372𓀴      interest, and
 Sir Henry Baskerville
 turned a pair of puzzled dark
1373𓀴      eyes upon me.
1374𓀴
1375𓀴      “I don’t know
 much about the
 tariff and things of that kind,”
1376𓀴      said he, “but
 it seems to me
 we’ve got a bit off the trail so far
1377𓀴      as that note is concerned.”
1378𓀴
1379𓀴      “On the contrary,
 I think we
 are particularly hot upon the trail,
1380𓀴      Sir Henry.
 Watson here knows
 more about my methods than you do,
1381𓀴      but I fear that even he has
 not quite grasped the significance of
1382𓀴      this sentence.”
1383𓀴
1384𓀴      “No, I confess that
 I see no connection.”
1385𓀴
1386𓀴      “And yet, my dear Watson,
 there is so very close a connection
1387𓀴      that the one is extracted
 out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’
1388𓀴      ‘your,’ ‘life,’
 ‘reason,’ ‘value,’
 ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ Don’t
1389𓀴      you see now whence these
 words have been taken?”
1390𓀴
1391𓀴      “By thunder,
 you’re right! Well,
 if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir
1392𓀴      Henry.
1393𓀴
1394𓀴      “If any possible
 doubt remained
 it is settled by the fact that
1395𓀴      ‘keep away’ and ‘from
 the’ are cut out in one piece.”
1396𓀴
1397𓀴      “Well, now—so it is!”
1398𓀴
1399𓀴      “Really, Mr. Holmes, this
 exceeds anything which I could have
1400𓀴      imagined,”
 said Dr. Mortimer,
 gazing at my friend in amazement.
1401𓀴      “I could understand anyone
 saying that the words were from a
1402𓀴      newspaper;
 but that you should
 name which, and add that it came
1403𓀴      from the leading
 article, is
 really one of the most remarkable
1404𓀴      things which I have ever
 known. How did you do it?”
1405𓀴
1406𓀴      “I presume,
 Doctor, that you
 could tell the skull of a negro from
1407𓀴      that of an Esquimau?”
1408𓀴
1409𓀴      “Most certainly.”
1410𓀴
1411𓀴      “But how?”
1412𓀴
1413𓀴      “Because that is my special
 hobby. The differences are obvious.
1414𓀴      The supra-orbital
 crest, the
 facial angle, the maxillary curve,
1415𓀴      the—”
1416𓀴
1417𓀴      “But this is
 my special hobby,
 and the differences are equally
1418𓀴      obvious. There is as much
 difference to my eyes between the
1419𓀴      leaded bourgeois
 type of a _Times_
 article and the slovenly print
1420𓀴      of an evening
 half-penny paper
 as there could be between your
1421𓀴      negro and
 your Esquimau. The
 detection of types is one of the
1422𓀴      most elementary branches of
 knowledge to the special expert in
1423𓀴      crime, though I confess
 that once when I was very young I
1424𓀴      confused the
 _Leeds Mercury_
 with the _Western Morning News_. But
1425𓀴      a _Times_
 leader is entirely
 distinctive, and these words could
1426𓀴      have been
 taken from nothing
 else. As it was done yesterday the
1427𓀴      strong probability was
 that we should find the words in
1428𓀴      yesterday’s issue.”
1429𓀴
1430𓀴      “So far as
 I can follow you,
 then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry
1431𓀴      Baskerville, “someone cut
 out this message with a scissors—”
1432𓀴
1433𓀴      “Nail-scissors,”
 said Holmes.
 “You can see that it was a very
1434𓀴      short-bladed
 scissors, since
 the cutter had to take two snips
1435𓀴      over ‘keep away.’”
1436𓀴
1437𓀴      “That is so. Someone, then,
 cut out the message with a pair of
1438𓀴      short-bladed scissors,
 pasted it with paste—”
1439𓀴
1440𓀴      “Gum,” said Holmes.
1441𓀴
1442𓀴      “With gum on
 to the paper. But
 I want to know why the word ‘moor’
1443𓀴      should have been written?”
1444𓀴
1445𓀴      “Because he
 could not find it
 in print. The other words were all
1446𓀴      simple and
 might be found in
 any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less
1447𓀴      common.”
1448𓀴
1449𓀴      “Why, of course, that would
 explain it. Have you read anything
1450𓀴      else in this
 message, Mr. Holmes?”
1451𓀴
1452𓀴      “There are one
 or two indications,
 and yet the utmost pains have
1453𓀴      been taken to remove all
 clues. The address, you observe is
1454𓀴      printed in
 rough characters.
 But the _Times_ is a paper which is
1455𓀴      seldom found
 in any hands but
 those of the highly educated. We
1456𓀴      may take it,
 therefore, that
 the letter was composed by an
1457𓀴      educated man who wished to
 pose as an uneducated one, and his
1458𓀴      effort to conceal his own
 writing suggests that that writing
1459𓀴      might be known, or come to
 be known, by you. Again, you will
1460𓀴      observe that
 the words are not
 gummed on in an accurate line, but
1461𓀴      that some are much higher
 than others. ‘Life,’ for example is
1462𓀴      quite out of
 its proper place.
 That may point to carelessness or
1463𓀴      it may point
 to agitation and
 hurry upon the part of the cutter.
1464𓀴      On the whole
 I incline to the
 latter view, since the matter was
1465𓀴      evidently important, and it
 is unlikely that the composer of such
1466𓀴      a letter would be careless.
 If he were in a hurry it opens up the
1467𓀴      interesting question why
 he should be in a hurry, since any
1468𓀴      letter posted
 up to early morning
 would reach Sir Henry before he
1469𓀴      would leave
 his hotel. Did the
 composer fear an interruption—and
1470𓀴      from whom?”
1471𓀴
1472𓀴      “We are coming
 now rather into
 the region of guesswork,” said Dr.
1473𓀴      Mortimer.
1474𓀴
1475𓀴      “Say, rather,
 into the region
 where we balance probabilities and
1476𓀴      choose the most likely.
 It is the scientific use of the
1477𓀴      imagination,
 but we have always
 some material basis on which to
1478𓀴      start our speculation. Now,
 you would call it a guess, no doubt,
1479𓀴      but I am almost
 certain that
 this address has been written in a
1480𓀴      hotel.”
1481𓀴
1482𓀴      “How in the world
 can you say that?”
1483𓀴
1484𓀴      “If you examine
 it carefully
 you will see that both the pen and
1485𓀴      the ink have
 given the writer
 trouble. The pen has spluttered
1486𓀴      twice in a single word and
 has run dry three times in a short
1487𓀴      address, showing that there
 was very little ink in the bottle.
1488𓀴      Now, a private
 pen or ink-bottle
 is seldom allowed to be in such
1489𓀴      a state, and
 the combination
 of the two must be quite rare. But
1490𓀴      you know the
 hotel ink and the
 hotel pen, where it is rare to get
1491𓀴      anything else.
 Yes, I have very
 little hesitation in saying that
1492𓀴      could we examine
 the waste-paper
 baskets of the hotels around
1493𓀴      Charing Cross
 until we found
 the remains of the mutilated _Times_
1494𓀴      leader we
 could lay our hands
 straight upon the person who sent
1495𓀴      this singular message.
 Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”
1496𓀴
1497𓀴      He was carefully examining
 the foolscap, upon which the words
1498𓀴      were pasted,
 holding it only
 an inch or two from his eyes.
1499𓀴
1500𓀴      “Well?”
1501𓀴
1502𓀴      “Nothing,”
 said he, throwing
 it down. “It is a blank half-sheet
1503𓀴      of paper, without
 even a water-mark
 upon it. I think we have
1504𓀴      drawn as much
 as we can from
 this curious letter; and now, Sir
1505𓀴      Henry, has anything else of
 interest happened to you since you
1506𓀴      have been in London?”
1507𓀴
1508𓀴      “Why, no, Mr.
 Holmes. I think not.”
1509𓀴
1510𓀴      “You have not observed
 anyone follow or watch you?”
1511𓀴
1512𓀴      “I seem to
 have walked right
 into the thick of a dime novel,”
1513𓀴      said our visitor.
 “Why in thunder
 should anyone follow or watch
1514𓀴      me?”
1515𓀴
1516𓀴      “We are coming to that. You
 have nothing else to report to us
1517𓀴      before we go
 into this matter?”
1518𓀴
1519𓀴      “Well, it depends upon
 what you think worth reporting.”
1520𓀴
1521𓀴      “I think anything
 out of the
 ordinary routine of life well worth
1522𓀴      reporting.”
1523𓀴
1524𓀴      Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t
 know much of British life yet, for I
1525𓀴      have spent
 nearly all my time
 in the States and in Canada. But I
1526𓀴      hope that
 to lose one of your
 boots is not part of the ordinary
1527𓀴      routine of life over here.”
1528𓀴
1529𓀴      “You have lost
 one of your boots?”
1530𓀴
1531𓀴      “My dear sir,”
 cried Dr. Mortimer,
 “it is only mislaid. You will
1532𓀴      find it when you return
 to the hotel. What is the use of
1533𓀴      troubling Mr. Holmes
 with trifles of this kind?”
1534𓀴
1535𓀴      “Well, he asked
 me for anything
 outside the ordinary routine.”
1536𓀴
1537𓀴      “Exactly,” said
 Holmes, “however
 foolish the incident may seem.
1538𓀴      You have lost one
 of your boots, you say?”
1539𓀴
1540𓀴      “Well, mislaid it, anyhow.
 I put them both outside my door last
1541𓀴      night, and there was only
 one in the morning. I could get no
1542𓀴      sense out of
 the chap who cleans
 them. The worst of it is that I
1543𓀴      only bought
 the pair last night
 in the Strand, and I have never
1544𓀴      had them on.”
1545𓀴
1546𓀴      “If you have
 never worn them,
 why did you put them out to be
1547𓀴      cleaned?”
1548𓀴
1549𓀴      “They were
 tan boots and had
 never been varnished. That was why I
1550𓀴      put them out.”
1551𓀴
1552𓀴      “Then I understand that on
 your arrival in London yesterday you
1553𓀴      went out at once and
 bought a pair of boots?”
1554𓀴
1555𓀴      “I did a good
 deal of shopping.
 Dr. Mortimer here went round with
1556𓀴      me. You see, if I am to be
 squire down there I must dress the
1557𓀴      part, and it
 may be that I have
 got a little careless in my ways
1558𓀴      out West.
 Among other things
 I bought these brown boots—gave six
1559𓀴      dollars for
 them—and had one
 stolen before ever I had them on my
1560𓀴      feet.”
1561𓀴
1562𓀴      “It seems a
 singularly useless
 thing to steal,” said Sherlock
1563𓀴      Holmes. “I confess that I
 share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it
1564𓀴      will not be long before
 the missing boot is found.”
1565𓀴
1566𓀴      “And, now, gentlemen,” said
 the baronet with decision, “it seems
1567𓀴      to me that
 I have spoken quite
 enough about the little that I
1568𓀴      know. It is
 time that you kept
 your promise and gave me a full
1569𓀴      account of what
 we are all driving at.”
1570𓀴
1571𓀴      “Your request
 is a very reasonable
 one,” Holmes answered. “Dr.
1572𓀴      Mortimer, I think you could
 not do better than to tell your story
1573𓀴      as you told it to us.”
1574𓀴
1575𓀴      Thus encouraged,
 our scientific
 friend drew his papers from his
1576𓀴      pocket and presented the
 whole case as he had done upon the
1577𓀴      morning before.
 Sir Henry Baskerville
 listened with the deepest
1578𓀴      attention and
 with an occasional
 exclamation of surprise.
1579𓀴
1580𓀴      “Well, I seem
 to have come into
 an inheritance with a vengeance,”
1581𓀴      said he when
 the long narrative
 was finished. “Of course, I’ve
1582𓀴      heard of the
 hound ever since
 I was in the nursery. It’s the pet
1583𓀴      story of the family, though
 I never thought of taking it
1584𓀴      seriously before. But as to
 my uncle’s death—well, it all seems
1585𓀴      boiling up in my head, and
 I can’t get it clear yet. You don’t
1586𓀴      seem quite to have made up
 your mind whether it’s a case for a
1587𓀴      policeman or a clergyman.”
1588𓀴
1589𓀴      “Precisely.”
1590𓀴
1591𓀴      “And now there’s
 this affair
 of the letter to me at the hotel. I
1592𓀴      suppose that
 fits into its place.”
1593𓀴
1594𓀴      “It seems to
 show that someone
 knows more than we do about what
1595𓀴      goes on upon the
 moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.
1596𓀴
1597𓀴      “And also,” said Holmes,
 “that someone is not ill-disposed
1598𓀴      towards you, since
 they warn you of danger.”
1599𓀴
1600𓀴      “Or it may
 be that they wish,
 for their own purposes, to scare me
1601𓀴      away.”
1602𓀴
1603𓀴      “Well, of course,
 that is possible
 also. I am very much indebted
1604𓀴      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for
 introducing me to a problem which
1605𓀴      presents several
 interesting
 alternatives. But the practical
1606𓀴      point which we
 now have to decide,
 Sir Henry, is whether it is or
1607𓀴      is not advisable for you
 to go to Baskerville Hall.”
1608𓀴
1609𓀴      “Why should I not go?”
1610𓀴
1611𓀴      “There seems to be danger.”
1612𓀴
1613𓀴      “Do you mean
 danger from this
 family fiend or do you mean danger
1614𓀴      from human beings?”
1615𓀴
1616𓀴      “Well, that is what
 we have to find out.”
1617𓀴
1618𓀴      “Whichever it is, my answer
 is fixed. There is no devil in hell,
1619𓀴      Mr. Holmes, and there is no
 man upon earth who can prevent me
1620𓀴      from going
 to the home of my
 own people, and you may take that to
1621𓀴      be my final
 answer.” His dark
 brows knitted and his face flushed
1622𓀴      to a dusky red as he spoke.
 It was evident that the fiery temper
1623𓀴      of the Baskervilles was
 not extinct in this their last
1624𓀴      representative.
 “Meanwhile,”
 said he, “I have hardly had time to
1625𓀴      think over
 all that you have
 told me. It’s a big thing for a man
1626𓀴      to have to
 understand and to
 decide at one sitting. I should like
1627𓀴      to have a quiet
 hour by myself
 to make up my mind. Now, look
1628𓀴      here, Mr. Holmes,
 it’s half-past
 eleven now and I am going back
1629𓀴      right away
 to my hotel. Suppose
 you and your friend, Dr. Watson,
1630𓀴      come round and lunch with
 us at two. I’ll be able to tell you
1631𓀴      more clearly then
 how this thing strikes me.”
1632𓀴
1633𓀴      “Is that convenient
 to you, Watson?”
1634𓀴
1635𓀴      “Perfectly.”
1636𓀴
1637𓀴      “Then you may expect us.
 Shall I have a cab called?”
1638𓀴
1639𓀴      “I’d prefer
 to walk, for this
 affair has flurried me rather.”
1640𓀴
1641𓀴      “I’ll join you in a walk,
 with pleasure,” said his companion.
1642𓀴
1643𓀴      “Then we meet
 again at two o’clock.
 Au revoir, and good-morning!”
1644𓀴
1645𓀴      We heard the
 steps of our visitors
 descend the stair and the bang
1646𓀴      of the front
 door. In an instant
 Holmes had changed from the
1647𓀴      languid dreamer
 to the man of action.
1648𓀴
1649𓀴      “Your hat
 and boots, Watson,
 quick! Not a moment to lose!” He
1650𓀴      rushed into his room in his
 dressing-gown and was back again in a
1651𓀴      few seconds
 in a frock-coat.
 We hurried together down the stairs
1652𓀴      and into the
 street. Dr. Mortimer
 and Baskerville were still
1653𓀴      visible about
 two hundred yards
 ahead of us in the direction of
1654𓀴      Oxford Street.
1655𓀴
1656𓀴      “Shall I run
 on and stop them?”
1657𓀴
1658𓀴      “Not for the world, my dear
 Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with
1659𓀴      your company
 if you will tolerate
 mine. Our friends are wise, for
1660𓀴      it is certainly a very
 fine morning for a walk.”
1661𓀴
1662𓀴      He quickened his pace until
 we had decreased the distance which
1663𓀴      divided us by about half.
 Then, still keeping a hundred yards
1664𓀴      behind, we
 followed into Oxford
 Street and so down Regent Street.
1665𓀴      Once our friends
 stopped and
 stared into a shop window, upon
1666𓀴      which Holmes
 did the same. An
 instant afterwards he gave a little
1667𓀴      cry of satisfaction,
 and, following
 the direction of his eager
1668𓀴      eyes, I saw
 that a hansom cab
 with a man inside which had halted
1669𓀴      on the other
 side of the street
 was now proceeding slowly onward
1670𓀴      again.
1671𓀴
1672𓀴      “There’s our
 man, Watson! Come
 along! We’ll have a good look at
1673𓀴      him, if we can do no more.”
1674𓀴
1675𓀴      At that instant I was aware
 of a bushy black beard and a pair of
1676𓀴      piercing eyes
 turned upon us
 through the side window of the cab.
1677𓀴      Instantly
 the trapdoor at the
 top flew up, something was screamed
1678𓀴      to the driver, and the cab
 flew madly off down Regent Street.
1679𓀴      Holmes looked eagerly round
 for another, but no empty one was in
1680𓀴      sight. Then
 he dashed in wild
 pursuit amid the stream of the
1681𓀴      traffic, but
 the start was too
 great, and already the cab was out
1682𓀴      of sight.
1683𓀴
1684𓀴      “There now!”
 said Holmes bitterly
 as he emerged panting and white
1685𓀴      with vexation from the tide
 of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck
1686𓀴      and such bad management,
 too? Watson, Watson, if you are an
1687𓀴      honest man you will record
 this also and set it against my
1688𓀴      successes!”
1689𓀴
1690𓀴      “Who was the man?”
1691𓀴
1692𓀴      “I have not an idea.”
1693𓀴
1694𓀴      “A spy?”
1695𓀴
1696𓀴      “Well, it was evident from
 what we have heard that Baskerville
1697𓀴      has been very
 closely shadowed
 by someone since he has been in
1698𓀴      town. How else could it be
 known so quickly that it was the
1699𓀴      Northumberland Hotel which
 he had chosen? If they had followed
1700𓀴      him the first day I argued
 that they would follow him also the
1701𓀴      second. You
 may have observed
 that I twice strolled over to the
1702𓀴      window while Dr. Mortimer
 was reading his legend.”
1703𓀴
1704𓀴      “Yes, I remember.”
1705𓀴
1706𓀴      “I was looking
 out for loiterers
 in the street, but I saw none.
1707𓀴      We are dealing
 with a clever
 man, Watson. This matter cuts very
1708𓀴      deep, and though I have not
 finally made up my mind whether it is
1709𓀴      a benevolent
 or a malevolent
 agency which is in touch with us, I
1710𓀴      am conscious
 always of power
 and design. When our friends left I
1711𓀴      at once followed them in
 the hopes of marking down their
1712𓀴      invisible
 attendant. So wily
 was he that he had not trusted
1713𓀴      himself upon
 foot, but he had
 availed himself of a cab so that he
1714𓀴      could loiter behind or dash
 past them and so escape their notice.
1715𓀴      His method
 had the additional
 advantage that if they were to take
1716𓀴      a cab he was all ready to
 follow them. It has, however, one
1717𓀴      obvious disadvantage.”
1718𓀴
1719𓀴      “It puts him in
 the power of the cabman.”
1720𓀴
1721𓀴      “Exactly.”
1722𓀴
1723𓀴      “What a pity we
 did not get the number!”
1724𓀴
1725𓀴      “My dear Watson, clumsy
 as I have been, you surely do not
1726𓀴      seriously imagine
 that I neglected
 to get the number? No. 2704 is
1727𓀴      our man. But that is
 no use to us for the moment.”
1728𓀴
1729𓀴      “I fail to see how
 you could have done more.”
1730𓀴
1731𓀴      “On observing
 the cab I should
 have instantly turned and walked
1732𓀴      in the other
 direction. I should
 then at my leisure have hired a
1733𓀴      second cab and followed the
 first at a respectful distance, or,
1734𓀴      better still,
 have driven to
 the Northumberland Hotel and waited
1735𓀴      there. When our unknown had
 followed Baskerville home we should
1736𓀴      have had the opportunity of
 playing his own game upon himself and
1737𓀴      seeing where
 he made for. As
 it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,
1738𓀴      which was taken advantage
 of with extraordinary quickness and
1739𓀴      energy by our opponent, we
 have betrayed ourselves and lost our
1740𓀴      man.”
1741𓀴
1742𓀴      We had been
 sauntering slowly
 down Regent Street during this
1743𓀴      conversation,
 and Dr. Mortimer,
 with his companion, had long
1744𓀴      vanished in front of us.
1745𓀴
1746𓀴      “There is no object in our
 following them,” said Holmes. “The
1747𓀴      shadow has
 departed and will
 not return. We must see what further
1748𓀴      cards we have
 in our hands and
 play them with decision. Could you
1749𓀴      swear to that man’s
 face within the cab?”
1750𓀴
1751𓀴      “I could swear
 only to the beard.”
1752𓀴
1753𓀴      “And so could I—from which
 I gather that in all probability it
1754𓀴      was a false
 one. A clever man
 upon so delicate an errand has no
1755𓀴      use for a beard
 save to conceal
 his features. Come in here,
1756𓀴      Watson!”
1757𓀴
1758𓀴      He turned into
 one of the district
 messenger offices, where he
1759𓀴      was warmly greeted
 by the manager.
1760𓀴
1761𓀴      “Ah, Wilson, I see you have
 not forgotten the little case in
1762𓀴      which I had the good
 fortune to help you?”
1763𓀴
1764𓀴      “No, sir,
 indeed I have not.
 You saved my good name, and perhaps
1765𓀴      my life.”
1766𓀴
1767𓀴      “My dear fellow,
 you exaggerate.
 I have some recollection,
1768𓀴      Wilson, that
 you had among your
 boys a lad named Cartwright, who
1769𓀴      showed some ability
 during the investigation.”
1770𓀴
1771𓀴      “Yes, sir, he
 is still with us.”
1772𓀴
1773𓀴      “Could you
 ring him up?—thank
 you! And I should be glad to have
1774𓀴      change of this
 five-pound note.”
1775𓀴
1776𓀴      A lad of fourteen, with a
 bright, keen face, had obeyed the
1777𓀴      summons of the
 manager. He stood
 now gazing with great reverence
1778𓀴      at the famous detective.
1779𓀴
1780𓀴      “Let me have
 the Hotel Directory,”
 said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,
1781𓀴      Cartwright,
 there are the names
 of twenty-three hotels here, all
1782𓀴      in the immediate
 neighbourhood
 of Charing Cross. Do you see?”
1783𓀴
1784𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
1785𓀴
1786𓀴      “You will visit
 each of these in turn.”
1787𓀴
1788𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
1789𓀴
1790𓀴      “You will
 begin in each case
 by giving the outside porter one
1791𓀴      shilling. Here are
 twenty-three shillings.”
1792𓀴
1793𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
1794𓀴
1795𓀴      “You will tell him that you
 want to see the waste-paper of
1796𓀴      yesterday.
 You will say that
 an important telegram has miscarried
1797𓀴      and that you are looking
 for it. You understand?”
1798𓀴
1799𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
1800𓀴
1801𓀴      “But what you
 are really looking
 for is the centre page of the
1802𓀴      _Times_ with some holes cut
 in it with scissors. Here is a copy
1803𓀴      of the _Times_. It is this
 page. You could easily recognize it,
1804𓀴      could you not?”
1805𓀴
1806𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
1807𓀴
1808𓀴      “In each case
 the outside porter
 will send for the hall porter,
1809𓀴      to whom also you will give
 a shilling. Here are twenty-three
1810𓀴      shillings.
 You will then learn
 in possibly twenty cases out of
1811𓀴      the twenty-three
 that the waste
 of the day before has been burned
1812𓀴      or removed.
 In the three other
 cases you will be shown a heap of
1813𓀴      paper and you will look for
 this page of the _Times_ among it.
1814𓀴      The odds are
 enormously against
 your finding it. There are ten
1815𓀴      shillings over
 in case of emergencies.
 Let me have a report by
1816𓀴      wire at Baker Street before
 evening. And now, Watson, it only
1817𓀴      remains for us to find out
 by wire the identity of the cabman,
1818𓀴      No. 2704, and then we will
 drop into one of the Bond Street
1819𓀴      picture galleries and fill
 in the time until we are due at the
1820𓀴      hotel.”

1826𓀴Three Broken Threads
1827𓀴
1828𓀴
1829𓀴      Sherlock Holmes
 had, in a very
 remarkable degree, the power of
1830𓀴      detaching his mind at will.
 For two hours the strange business in
1831𓀴      which we had been involved
 appeared to be forgotten, and he was
1832𓀴      entirely absorbed
 in the pictures
 of the modern Belgian masters.
1833𓀴      He would talk
 of nothing but
 art, of which he had the crudest
1834𓀴      ideas, from our leaving the
 gallery until we found ourselves at
1835𓀴      the Northumberland Hotel.
1836𓀴
1837𓀴      “Sir Henry Baskerville is
 upstairs expecting you,” said the
1838𓀴      clerk. “He asked me to show
 you up at once when you came.”
1839𓀴
1840𓀴      “Have you any objection to
 my looking at your register?” said
1841𓀴      Holmes.
1842𓀴
1843𓀴      “Not in the least.”
1844𓀴
1845𓀴      The book showed that two
 names had been added after that of
1846𓀴      Baskerville.
 One was Theophilus
 Johnson and family, of Newcastle;
1847𓀴      the other Mrs. Oldmore
 and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.
1848𓀴
1849𓀴      “Surely that
 must be the same
 Johnson whom I used to know,” said
1850𓀴      Holmes to the
 porter. “A lawyer,
 is he not, grey-headed, and
1851𓀴      walks with a limp?”
1852𓀴
1853𓀴      “No, sir, this
 is Mr. Johnson,
 the coal-owner, a very active
1854𓀴      gentleman, not
 older than yourself.”
1855𓀴
1856𓀴      “Surely you are mistaken
 about his trade?”
1857𓀴
1858𓀴      “No, sir! he has used this
 hotel for many years, and he is very
1859𓀴      well known to us.”
1860𓀴
1861𓀴      “Ah, that settles it. Mrs.
 Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the
1862𓀴      name. Excuse my curiosity,
 but often in calling upon one friend
1863𓀴      one finds another.”
1864𓀴
1865𓀴      “She is an invalid lady,
 sir. Her husband was once mayor of
1866𓀴      Gloucester.
 She always comes
 to us when she is in town.”
1867𓀴
1868𓀴      “Thank you;
 I am afraid I cannot
 claim her acquaintance. We have
1869𓀴      established
 a most important
 fact by these questions, Watson,” he
1870𓀴      continued in a low voice as
 we went upstairs together. “We know
1871𓀴      now that the people who are
 so interested in our friend have not
1872𓀴      settled down
 in his own hotel.
 That means that while they are, as
1873𓀴      we have seen,
 very anxious to
 watch him, they are equally anxious
1874𓀴      that he should
 not see them.
 Now, this is a most suggestive
1875𓀴      fact.”
1876𓀴
1877𓀴      “What does it suggest?”
1878𓀴
1879𓀴      “It suggests—halloa, my
 dear fellow, what on earth is the
1880𓀴      matter?”
1881𓀴
1882𓀴      As we came round the top of
 the stairs we had run up against Sir
1883𓀴      Henry Baskerville himself.
 His face was flushed with anger, and
1884𓀴      he held an
 old and dusty boot
 in one of his hands. So furious was
1885𓀴      he that he was
 hardly articulate,
 and when he did speak it was in
1886𓀴      a much broader
 and more Western
 dialect than any which we had
1887𓀴      heard from
 him in the morning.
1888𓀴
1889𓀴      “Seems to
 me they are playing
 me for a sucker in this hotel,” he
1890𓀴      cried. “They’ll
 find they’ve
 started in to monkey with the wrong
1891𓀴      man unless
 they are careful.
 By thunder, if that chap can’t find
1892𓀴      my missing
 boot there will be
 trouble. I can take a joke with the
1893𓀴      best, Mr.
 Holmes, but they’ve
 got a bit over the mark this time.”
1894𓀴
1895𓀴      “Still looking
 for your boot?”
1896𓀴
1897𓀴      “Yes, sir, and
 mean to find it.”
1898𓀴
1899𓀴      “But, surely, you said
 that it was a new brown boot?”
1900𓀴
1901𓀴      “So it was, sir. And
 now it’s an old black one.”
1902𓀴
1903𓀴      “What! you
 don’t mean to say—?”
1904𓀴
1905𓀴      “That’s just what I do mean
 to say. I only had three pairs in the
1906𓀴      world—the
 new brown, the old
 black, and the patent leathers,
1907𓀴      which I am
 wearing. Last night
 they took one of my brown ones,
1908𓀴      and today they have sneaked
 one of the black. Well, have you got
1909𓀴      it? Speak out, man,
 and don’t stand staring!”
1910𓀴
1911𓀴      An agitated German waiter
 had appeared upon the scene.
1912𓀴
1913𓀴      “No, sir;
 I have made inquiry
 all over the hotel, but I can hear
1914𓀴      no word of it.”
1915𓀴
1916𓀴      “Well, either
 that boot comes
 back before sundown or I’ll see the
1917𓀴      manager and tell him that I
 go right straight out of this hotel.”
1918𓀴
1919𓀴      “It shall be found, sir—I
 promise you that if you will have a
1920𓀴      little patience
 it will be found.”
1921𓀴
1922𓀴      “Mind it is,
 for it’s the last
 thing of mine that I’ll lose in
1923𓀴      this den of thieves. Well,
 well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my
1924𓀴      troubling you
 about such a trifle—”
1925𓀴
1926𓀴      “I think it’s well
 worth troubling about.”
1927𓀴
1928𓀴      “Why, you look
 very serious over it.”
1929𓀴
1930𓀴      “How do you explain it?”
1931𓀴
1932𓀴      “I just don’t
 attempt to explain
 it. It seems the very maddest,
1933𓀴      queerest thing that
 ever happened to me.”
1934𓀴
1935𓀴      “The queerest perhaps—”
 said Holmes thoughtfully.
1936𓀴
1937𓀴      “What do you
 make of it yourself?”
1938𓀴
1939𓀴      “Well, I don’t
 profess to understand
 it yet. This case of yours
1940𓀴      is very complex, Sir Henry.
 When taken in conjunction with your
1941𓀴      uncle’s death I am not sure
 that of all the five hundred cases of
1942𓀴      capital importance which I
 have handled there is one which cuts
1943𓀴      so deep. But
 we hold several
 threads in our hands, and the odds
1944𓀴      are that one
 or other of them
 guides us to the truth. We may
1945𓀴      waste time in following the
 wrong one, but sooner or later we
1946𓀴      must come upon the right.”
1947𓀴
1948𓀴      We had a pleasant luncheon
 in which little was said of the
1949𓀴      business which had brought
 us together. It was in the private
1950𓀴      sitting-room
 to which we afterwards
 repaired that Holmes asked
1951𓀴      Baskerville what
 were his intentions.
1952𓀴
1953𓀴      “To go to
 Baskerville Hall.”
1954𓀴
1955𓀴      “And when?”
1956𓀴
1957𓀴      “At the end of the week.”
1958𓀴
1959𓀴      “On the whole,”
 said Holmes,
 “I think that your decision is a
1960𓀴      wise one. I
 have ample evidence
 that you are being dogged in
1961𓀴      London, and
 amid the millions
 of this great city it is difficult
1962𓀴      to discover
 who these people
 are or what their object can be. If
1963𓀴      their intentions
 are evil they
 might do you a mischief, and we
1964𓀴      should be powerless
 to prevent
 it. You did not know, Dr.
1965𓀴      Mortimer, that
 you were followed
 this morning from my house?”
1966𓀴
1967𓀴      Dr. Mortimer
 started violently.
 “Followed! By whom?”
1968𓀴
1969𓀴      “That, unfortunately,
 is what
 I cannot tell you. Have you among
1970𓀴      your neighbours
 or acquaintances
 on Dartmoor any man with a
1971𓀴      black, full beard?”
1972𓀴
1973𓀴      “No—or, let
 me see—why, yes.
 Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is
1974𓀴      a man with a
 full, black beard.”
1975𓀴
1976𓀴      “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”
1977𓀴
1978𓀴      “He is in charge
 of the Hall.”
1979𓀴
1980𓀴      “We had best ascertain if
 he is really there, or if by any
1981𓀴      possibility he
 might be in London.”
1982𓀴
1983𓀴      “How can you do that?”
1984𓀴
1985𓀴      “Give me a telegraph form.
 ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That
1986𓀴      will do. Address
 to Mr. Barrymore,
 Baskerville Hall. What is the
1987𓀴      nearest telegraph-office?
 Grimpen. Very good, we will send a
1988𓀴      second wire
 to the postmaster,
 Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr.
1989𓀴      Barrymore to
 be delivered into
 his own hand. If absent, please
1990𓀴      return wire to
 Sir Henry Baskerville,
 Northumberland Hotel.’ That
1991𓀴      should let us know before
 evening whether Barrymore is at his
1992𓀴      post in Devonshire or not.”
1993𓀴
1994𓀴      “That’s so,”
 said Baskerville.
 “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is
1995𓀴      this Barrymore, anyhow?”
1996𓀴
1997𓀴      “He is the son of the old
 caretaker, who is dead. They have
1998𓀴      looked after
 the Hall for four
 generations now. So far as I know,
1999𓀴      he and his wife
 are as respectable
 a couple as any in the
2000𓀴      county.”
2001𓀴
2002𓀴      “At the same time,”
 said Baskerville,
 “it’s clear enough that so
2003𓀴      long as there are none of
 the family at the Hall these people
2004𓀴      have a mighty fine
 home and nothing to do.”
2005𓀴
2006𓀴      “That is true.”
2007𓀴
2008𓀴      “Did Barrymore profit at
 all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked
2009𓀴      Holmes.
2010𓀴
2011𓀴      “He and his wife had
 five hundred pounds each.”
2012𓀴
2013𓀴      “Ha! Did they know that
 they would receive this?”
2014𓀴
2015𓀴      “Yes; Sir Charles was very
 fond of talking about the provisions
2016𓀴      of his will.”
2017𓀴
2018𓀴      “That is very interesting.”
2019𓀴
2020𓀴      “I hope,”
 said Dr. Mortimer,
 “that you do not look with
2021𓀴      suspicious
 eyes upon everyone
 who received a legacy from Sir
2022𓀴      Charles, for I also had
 a thousand pounds left to me.”
2023𓀴
2024𓀴      “Indeed! And anyone else?”
2025𓀴
2026𓀴      “There were
 many insignificant
 sums to individuals, and a large
2027𓀴      number of public charities.
 The residue all went to Sir Henry.”
2028𓀴
2029𓀴      “And how much
 was the residue?”
2030𓀴
2031𓀴      “Seven hundred and
 forty thousand pounds.”
2032𓀴
2033𓀴      Holmes raised his eyebrows
 in surprise. “I had no idea that so
2034𓀴      gigantic a sum
 was involved,” said he.
2035𓀴
2036𓀴      “Sir Charles
 had the reputation
 of being rich, but we did not
2037𓀴      know how very rich he was
 until we came to examine his
2038𓀴      securities. The total value
 of the estate was close on to a
2039𓀴      million.”
2040𓀴
2041𓀴      “Dear me! It is a stake
 for which a man might well play a
2042𓀴      desperate
 game. And one more
 question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing
2043𓀴      that anything
 happened to our
 young friend here—you will forgive
2044𓀴      the unpleasant
 hypothesis!—who
 would inherit the estate?”
2045𓀴
2046𓀴      “Since Rodger Baskerville,
 Sir Charles’s younger brother died
2047𓀴      unmarried, the estate would
 descend to the Desmonds, who are
2048𓀴      distant cousins.
 James Desmond
 is an elderly clergyman in
2049𓀴      Westmoreland.”
2050𓀴
2051𓀴      “Thank you.
 These details are
 all of great interest. Have you met
2052𓀴      Mr. James Desmond?”
2053𓀴
2054𓀴      “Yes; he once came down to
 visit Sir Charles. He is a man of
2055𓀴      venerable appearance and of
 saintly life. I remember that he
2056𓀴      refused to accept
 any settlement
 from Sir Charles, though he
2057𓀴      pressed it upon him.”
2058𓀴
2059𓀴      “And this man
 of simple tastes
 would be the heir to Sir Charles’s
2060𓀴      thousands.”
2061𓀴
2062𓀴      “He would
 be the heir to the
 estate because that is entailed. He
2063𓀴      would also be the heir to
 the money unless it were willed
2064𓀴      otherwise by
 the present owner,
 who can, of course, do what he
2065𓀴      likes with it.”
2066𓀴
2067𓀴      “And have you made
 your will, Sir Henry?”
2068𓀴
2069𓀴      “No, Mr. Holmes,
 I have not.
 I’ve had no time, for it was only
2070𓀴      yesterday
 that I learned how
 matters stood. But in any case I
2071𓀴      feel that
 the money should go
 with the title and estate. That was
2072𓀴      my poor uncle’s idea. How
 is the owner going to restore the
2073𓀴      glories of the Baskervilles
 if he has not money enough to keep up
2074𓀴      the property? House, land,
 and dollars must go together.”
2075𓀴
2076𓀴      “Quite so. Well, Sir Henry,
 I am of one mind with you as to the
2077𓀴      advisability of your going
 down to Devonshire without delay.
2078𓀴      There is only one provision
 which I must make. You certainly must
2079𓀴      not go alone.”
2080𓀴
2081𓀴      “Dr. Mortimer
 returns with me.”
2082𓀴
2083𓀴      “But Dr. Mortimer
 has his practice
 to attend to, and his house is
2084𓀴      miles away from yours. With
 all the goodwill in the world he may
2085𓀴      be unable to help you. No,
 Sir Henry, you must take with you
2086𓀴      someone, a trusty man, who
 will be always by your side.”
2087𓀴
2088𓀴      “Is it possible that you
 could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”
2089𓀴
2090𓀴      “If matters
 came to a crisis
 I should endeavour to be present in
2091𓀴      person; but
 you can understand
 that, with my extensive consulting
2092𓀴      practice and
 with the constant
 appeals which reach me from many
2093𓀴      quarters, it
 is impossible for
 me to be absent from London for an
2094𓀴      indefinite
 time. At the present
 instant one of the most revered
2095𓀴      names in England
 is being besmirched
 by a blackmailer, and only I
2096𓀴      can stop a
 disastrous scandal.
 You will see how impossible it is
2097𓀴      for me to go to Dartmoor.”
2098𓀴
2099𓀴      “Whom would
 you recommend, then?”
2100𓀴
2101𓀴      Holmes laid
 his hand upon my
 arm. “If my friend would undertake
2102𓀴      it there is
 no man who is better
 worth having at your side when
2103𓀴      you are in
 a tight place. No
 one can say so more confidently than
2104𓀴      I.”
2105𓀴
2106𓀴      The proposition
 took me completely
 by surprise, but before I had
2107𓀴      time to answer, Baskerville
 seized me by the hand and wrung it
2108𓀴      heartily.
2109𓀴
2110𓀴      “Well, now,
 that is real kind
 of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You
2111𓀴      see how it
 is with me, and you
 know just as much about the matter
2112𓀴      as I do. If you will come
 down to Baskerville Hall and see me
2113𓀴      through I’ll
 never forget it.”
2114𓀴
2115𓀴      The promise
 of adventure had
 always a fascination for me, and I
2116𓀴      was complimented
 by the words
 of Holmes and by the eagerness with
2117𓀴      which the baronet
 hailed me as a companion.
2118𓀴
2119𓀴      “I will come,
 with pleasure,”
 said I. “I do not know how I could
2120𓀴      employ my time better.”
2121𓀴
2122𓀴      “And you will
 report very carefully
 to me,” said Holmes. “When a
2123𓀴      crisis comes,
 as it will do,
 I will direct how you shall act. I
2124𓀴      suppose that by Saturday
 all might be ready?”
2125𓀴
2126𓀴      “Would that
 suit Dr. Watson?”
2127𓀴
2128𓀴      “Perfectly.”
2129𓀴
2130𓀴      “Then on Saturday,
 unless you
 hear to the contrary, we shall meet
2131𓀴      at the ten-thirty
 train from Paddington.”
2132𓀴
2133𓀴      We had risen to depart when
 Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,
2134𓀴      and diving into one of the
 corners of the room he drew a brown
2135𓀴      boot from under a cabinet.
2136𓀴
2137𓀴      “My missing
 boot!” he cried.
2138𓀴
2139𓀴      “May all our difficulties
 vanish as easily!” said Sherlock
2140𓀴      Holmes.
2141𓀴
2142𓀴      “But it is a very singular
 thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I
2143𓀴      searched this room
 carefully before lunch.”
2144𓀴
2145𓀴      “And so did
 I,” said Baskerville.
 “Every inch of it.”
2146𓀴
2147𓀴      “There was certainly
 no boot in it then.”
2148𓀴
2149𓀴      “In that case
 the waiter must
 have placed it there while we were
2150𓀴      lunching.”
2151𓀴
2152𓀴      The German was sent for but
 professed to know nothing of the
2153𓀴      matter, nor
 could any inquiry
 clear it up. Another item had been
2154𓀴      added to that
 constant and apparently
 purposeless series of small
2155𓀴      mysteries
 which had succeeded
 each other so rapidly. Setting
2156𓀴      aside the
 whole grim story of
 Sir Charles’s death, we had a line
2157𓀴      of inexplicable incidents
 all within the limits of two days,
2158𓀴      which included the receipt
 of the printed letter, the
2159𓀴      black-bearded
 spy in the hansom,
 the loss of the new brown boot,
2160𓀴      the loss of the old black
 boot, and now the return of the new
2161𓀴      brown boot.
 Holmes sat in silence
 in the cab as we drove back to
2162𓀴      Baker Street,
 and I knew from
 his drawn brows and keen face that
2163𓀴      his mind, like my own, was
 busy in endeavouring to frame some
2164𓀴      scheme into which all these
 strange and apparently disconnected
2165𓀴      episodes could
 be fitted. All
 afternoon and late into the evening
2166𓀴      he sat lost in
 tobacco and thought.
2167𓀴
2168𓀴      Just before
 dinner two telegrams
 were handed in. The first ran:
2169𓀴
2170𓀴      Have just heard
 that Barrymore
 is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.
2171𓀴
2172𓀴      The second:
2173𓀴
2174𓀴      Visited twenty-three hotels
 as directed, but sorry to report
2175𓀴      unable to trace cut
 sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.
2176𓀴
2177𓀴      “There go
 two of my threads,
 Watson. There is nothing more
2178𓀴      stimulating
 than a case where
 everything goes against you. We
2179𓀴      must cast round
 for another scent.”
2180𓀴
2181𓀴      “We have still the
 cabman who drove the spy.”
2182𓀴
2183𓀴      “Exactly. I have wired to
 get his name and address from the
2184𓀴      Official Registry. I should
 not be surprised if this were an
2185𓀴      answer to my question.”
2186𓀴
2187𓀴      The ring at the bell proved
 to be something even more
2188𓀴      satisfactory
 than an answer,
 however, for the door opened and a
2189𓀴      rough-looking
 fellow entered
 who was evidently the man himself.
2190𓀴
2191𓀴      “I got a message
 from the head
 office that a gent at this address
2192𓀴      had been inquiring for No.
 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab
2193𓀴      this seven years and never
 a word of complaint. I came here
2194𓀴      straight from the Yard to
 ask you to your face what you had
2195𓀴      against me.”
2196𓀴
2197𓀴      “I have nothing
 in the world
 against you, my good man,” said
2198𓀴      Holmes. “On the contrary, I
 have half a sovereign for you if you
2199𓀴      will give me a clear
 answer to my questions.”
2200𓀴
2201𓀴      “Well, I’ve
 had a good day and
 no mistake,” said the cabman with
2202𓀴      a grin. “What was
 it you wanted to ask, sir?”
2203𓀴
2204𓀴      “First of all your name and
 address, in case I want you again.”
2205𓀴
2206𓀴      “John Clayton,
 3 Turpey Street,
 the Borough. My cab is out of
2207𓀴      Shipley’s Yard,
 near Waterloo Station.”
2208𓀴
2209𓀴      Sherlock Holmes
 made a note of it.
2210𓀴
2211𓀴      “Now, Clayton, tell me all
 about the fare who came and watched
2212𓀴      this house
 at ten o’clock this
 morning and afterwards followed
2213𓀴      the two gentlemen
 down Regent Street.”
2214𓀴
2215𓀴      The man looked
 surprised and
 a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s
2216𓀴      no good my
 telling you things,
 for you seem to know as much as I
2217𓀴      do already,” said he. “The
 truth is that the gentleman told me
2218𓀴      that he was a detective and
 that I was to say nothing about him
2219𓀴      to anyone.”
2220𓀴
2221𓀴      “My good fellow; this is a
 very serious business, and you may
2222𓀴      find yourself in a pretty
 bad position if you try to hide
2223𓀴      anything from
 me. You say that
 your fare told you that he was a
2224𓀴      detective?”
2225𓀴
2226𓀴      “Yes, he did.”
2227𓀴
2228𓀴      “When did he say this?”
2229𓀴
2230𓀴      “When he left me.”
2231𓀴
2232𓀴      “Did he say anything more?”
2233𓀴
2234𓀴      “He mentioned his name.”
2235𓀴
2236𓀴      Holmes cast a swift glance
 of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned
2237𓀴      his name, did he? That was
 imprudent. What was the name that he
2238𓀴      mentioned?”
2239𓀴
2240𓀴      “His name,”
 said the cabman,
 “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
2241𓀴
2242𓀴      Never have I seen my friend
 more completely taken aback than by
2243𓀴      the cabman’s reply. For an
 instant he sat in silent amazement.
2244𓀴      Then he burst
 into a hearty laugh.
2245𓀴
2246𓀴      “A touch, Watson—an
 undeniable
 touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as
2247𓀴      quick and supple as my own.
 He got home upon me very prettily
2248𓀴      that time. So his name
 was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”
2249𓀴
2250𓀴      “Yes, sir, that was
 the gentleman’s name.”
2251𓀴
2252𓀴      “Excellent! Tell me where
 you picked him up and all that
2253𓀴      occurred.”
2254𓀴
2255𓀴      “He hailed
 me at half-past nine
 in Trafalgar Square. He said that
2256𓀴      he was a detective, and he
 offered me two guineas if I would do
2257𓀴      exactly what he wanted all
 day and ask no questions. I was glad
2258𓀴      enough to agree.
 First we drove
 down to the Northumberland Hotel
2259𓀴      and waited there
 until two gentlemen
 came out and took a cab from
2260𓀴      the rank. We followed their
 cab until it pulled up somewhere near
2261𓀴      here.”
2262𓀴
2263𓀴      “This very
 door,” said Holmes.
2264𓀴
2265𓀴      “Well, I couldn’t
 be sure of
 that, but I dare say my fare knew
2266𓀴      all about it.
 We pulled up halfway
 down the street and waited an
2267𓀴      hour and a
 half. Then the two
 gentlemen passed us, walking, and
2268𓀴      we followed down
 Baker Street and along—”
2269𓀴
2270𓀴      “I know,” said Holmes.
2271𓀴
2272𓀴      “Until we
 got three-quarters
 down Regent Street. Then my
2273𓀴      gentleman
 threw up the trap,
 and he cried that I should drive
2274𓀴      right away
 to Waterloo Station
 as hard as I could go. I whipped
2275𓀴      up the mare
 and we were there
 under the ten minutes. Then he paid
2276𓀴      up his two guineas, like a
 good one, and away he went into the
2277𓀴      station. Only
 just as he was
 leaving he turned round and he said:
2278𓀴      ‘It might interest you to
 know that you have been driving Mr.
2279𓀴      Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s
 how I come to know the name.”
2280𓀴
2281𓀴      “I see. And you
 saw no more of him?”
2282𓀴
2283𓀴      “Not after he
 went into the station.”
2284𓀴
2285𓀴      “And how would you describe
 Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
2286𓀴
2287𓀴      The cabman
 scratched his head.
 “Well, he wasn’t altogether such
2288𓀴      an easy gentleman
 to describe.
 I’d put him at forty years of age,
2289𓀴      and he was
 of a middle height,
 two or three inches shorter than
2290𓀴      you, sir.
 He was dressed like
 a toff, and he had a black beard,
2291𓀴      cut square at the end, and
 a pale face. I don’t know as I could
2292𓀴      say more than that.”
2293𓀴
2294𓀴      “Colour of his eyes?”
2295𓀴
2296𓀴      “No, I can’t say that.”
2297𓀴
2298𓀴      “Nothing more
 that you can remember?”
2299𓀴
2300𓀴      “No, sir; nothing.”
2301𓀴
2302𓀴      “Well, then, here is your
 half-sovereign. There’s another one
2303𓀴      waiting for you if you
 can bring any more information.
2304𓀴      Good-night!”
2305𓀴
2306𓀴      “Good-night,
 sir, and thank you!”
2307𓀴
2308𓀴      John Clayton
 departed chuckling,
 and Holmes turned to me with a
2309𓀴      shrug of his shoulders
 and a rueful smile.
2310𓀴
2311𓀴      “Snap goes
 our third thread,
 and we end where we began,” said he.
2312𓀴      “The cunning
 rascal! He knew
 our number, knew that Sir Henry
2313𓀴      Baskerville
 had consulted me,
 spotted who I was in Regent Street,
2314𓀴      conjectured
 that I had got the
 number of the cab and would lay my
2315𓀴      hands on the driver, and so
 sent back this audacious message. I
2316𓀴      tell you, Watson, this time
 we have got a foeman who is worthy of
2317𓀴      our steel.
 I’ve been checkmated
 in London. I can only wish you
2318𓀴      better luck
 in Devonshire. But
 I’m not easy in my mind about it.”
2319𓀴
2320𓀴      “About what?”
2321𓀴
2322𓀴      “About sending you. It’s
 an ugly business, Watson, an ugly
2323𓀴      dangerous business, and the
 more I see of it the less I like it.
2324𓀴      Yes, my dear
 fellow, you may
 laugh, but I give you my word that I
2325𓀴      shall be very glad to have
 you back safe and sound in Baker
2326𓀴      Street once more.”

2332𓀴Baskerville Hall
2333𓀴
2334𓀴
2335𓀴      Sir Henry Baskerville and
 Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the
2336𓀴      appointed
 day, and we started
 as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.
2337𓀴      Sherlock Holmes
 drove with me
 to the station and gave me his last
2338𓀴      parting injunctions
 and advice.
2339𓀴
2340𓀴      “I will not
 bias your mind by
 suggesting theories or suspicions,
2341𓀴      Watson,” said he; “I wish
 you simply to report facts in the
2342𓀴      fullest possible manner to
 me, and you can leave me to do the
2343𓀴      theorizing.”
2344𓀴
2345𓀴      “What sort
 of facts?” I asked.
2346𓀴
2347𓀴      “Anything which may seem to
 have a bearing however indirect upon
2348𓀴      the case,
 and especially the
 relations between young Baskerville
2349𓀴      and his neighbours
 or any fresh
 particulars concerning the death
2350𓀴      of Sir Charles. I have made
 some inquiries myself in the last few
2351𓀴      days, but the results have,
 I fear, been negative. One thing only
2352𓀴      appears to
 be certain, and that
 is that Mr. James Desmond, who is
2353𓀴      the next heir,
 is an elderly
 gentleman of a very amiable
2354𓀴      disposition, so
 that this persecution
 does not arise from him. I
2355𓀴      really think that we may
 eliminate him entirely from our
2356𓀴      calculations.
 There remain the
 people who will actually surround
2357𓀴      Sir Henry Baskerville
 upon the moor.”
2358𓀴
2359𓀴      “Would it not be well in
 the first place to get rid of this
2360𓀴      Barrymore couple?”
2361𓀴
2362𓀴      “By no means. You could not
 make a greater mistake. If they are
2363𓀴      innocent it
 would be a cruel
 injustice, and if they are guilty we
2364𓀴      should be giving
 up all chance
 of bringing it home to them. No,
2365𓀴      no, we will
 preserve them upon
 our list of suspects. Then there
2366𓀴      is a groom at the Hall, if
 I remember right. There are two
2367𓀴      moorland farmers. There is
 our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I
2368𓀴      believe to
 be entirely honest,
 and there is his wife, of whom we
2369𓀴      know nothing. There is this
 naturalist, Stapleton, and there is
2370𓀴      his sister,
 who is said to be
 a young lady of attractions. There
2371𓀴      is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter
 Hall, who is also an unknown factor,
2372𓀴      and there are
 one or two other
 neighbours. These are the folk who
2373𓀴      must be your
 very special study.”
2374𓀴
2375𓀴      “I will do my best.”
2376𓀴
2377𓀴      “You have arms, I suppose?”
2378𓀴
2379𓀴      “Yes, I thought
 it as well to take them.”
2380𓀴
2381𓀴      “Most certainly. Keep your
 revolver near you night and day, and
2382𓀴      never relax
 your precautions.”
2383𓀴
2384𓀴      Our friends
 had already secured
 a first-class carriage and were
2385𓀴      waiting for
 us upon the platform.
2386𓀴
2387𓀴      “No, we have no news of any
 kind,” said Dr. Mortimer in answer to
2388𓀴      my friend’s questions. “I
 can swear to one thing, and that is
2389𓀴      that we have
 not been shadowed
 during the last two days. We have
2390𓀴      never gone
 out without keeping
 a sharp watch, and no one could
2391𓀴      have escaped our notice.”
2392𓀴
2393𓀴      “You have always
 kept together, I presume?”
2394𓀴
2395𓀴      “Except yesterday
 afternoon.
 I usually give up one day to pure
2396𓀴      amusement when
 I come to town,
 so I spent it at the Museum of the
2397𓀴      College of Surgeons.”
2398𓀴
2399𓀴      “And I went to look at the
 folk in the park,” said Baskerville.
2400𓀴
2401𓀴      “But we had no
 trouble of any kind.”
2402𓀴
2403𓀴      “It was imprudent, all the
 same,” said Holmes, shaking his head
2404𓀴      and looking very grave. “I
 beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go
2405𓀴      about alone.
 Some great misfortune
 will befall you if you do. Did
2406𓀴      you get your other boot?”
2407𓀴
2408𓀴      “No, sir, it
 is gone forever.”
2409𓀴
2410𓀴      “Indeed. That
 is very interesting.
 Well, good-bye,” he added as
2411𓀴      the train
 began to glide down
 the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir
2412𓀴      Henry, one of the phrases
 in that queer old legend which Dr.
2413𓀴      Mortimer has
 read to us, and
 avoid the moor in those hours of
2414𓀴      darkness when the powers
 of evil are exalted.”
2415𓀴
2416𓀴      I looked back
 at the platform
 when we had left it far behind and
2417𓀴      saw the tall,
 austere figure
 of Holmes standing motionless and
2418𓀴      gazing after us.
2419𓀴
2420𓀴      The journey was a swift and
 pleasant one, and I spent it in
2421𓀴      making the more
 intimate acquaintance
 of my two companions and in
2422𓀴      playing with Dr. Mortimer’s
 spaniel. In a very few hours the
2423𓀴      brown earth
 had become ruddy,
 the brick had changed to granite,
2424𓀴      and red cows
 grazed in well-hedged
 fields where the lush grasses
2425𓀴      and more luxuriant
 vegetation
 spoke of a richer, if a damper,
2426𓀴      climate. Young Baskerville
 stared eagerly out of the window and
2427𓀴      cried aloud with delight as
 he recognized the familiar features
2428𓀴      of the Devon scenery.
2429𓀴
2430𓀴      “I’ve been over a good part
 of the world since I left it, Dr.
2431𓀴      Watson,” said
 he; “but I have
 never seen a place to compare with
2432𓀴      it.”
2433𓀴
2434𓀴      “I never saw
 a Devonshire man
 who did not swear by his county,” I
2435𓀴      remarked.
2436𓀴
2437𓀴      “It depends upon the breed
 of men quite as much as on the
2438𓀴      county,” said Dr. Mortimer.
 “A glance at our friend here reveals
2439𓀴      the rounded
 head of the Celt,
 which carries inside it the Celtic
2440𓀴      enthusiasm and
 power of attachment.
 Poor Sir Charles’s head was
2441𓀴      of a very rare type, half
 Gaelic, half Ivernian in its
2442𓀴      characteristics. But you
 were very young when you last saw
2443𓀴      Baskerville
 Hall, were you not?”
2444𓀴
2445𓀴      “I was a boy in my teens at
 the time of my father’s death and had
2446𓀴      never seen the Hall, for he
 lived in a little cottage on the
2447𓀴      South Coast. Thence I went
 straight to a friend in America. I
2448𓀴      tell you it
 is all as new to
 me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m
2449𓀴      as keen as possible
 to see the moor.”
2450𓀴
2451𓀴      “Are you? Then your wish is
 easily granted, for there is your
2452𓀴      first sight
 of the moor,” said
 Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the
2453𓀴      carriage window.
2454𓀴
2455𓀴      Over the green
 squares of the
 fields and the low curve of a wood
2456𓀴      there rose in the distance
 a grey, melancholy hill, with a
2457𓀴      strange jagged summit, dim
 and vague in the distance, like some
2458𓀴      fantastic landscape
 in a dream.
 Baskerville sat for a long time,
2459𓀴      his eyes fixed upon it, and
 I read upon his eager face how much
2460𓀴      it meant to him, this first
 sight of that strange spot where the
2461𓀴      men of his blood had held
 sway so long and left their mark so
2462𓀴      deep. There
 he sat, with his
 tweed suit and his American accent,
2463𓀴      in the corner of a
 prosaic railway-carriage,
 and yet as I looked
2464𓀴      at his dark
 and expressive face
 I felt more than ever how true a
2465𓀴      descendant
 he was of that long
 line of high-blooded, fiery, and
2466𓀴      masterful men. There were
 pride, valour, and strength in his
2467𓀴      thick brows, his
 sensitive nostrils,
 and his large hazel eyes. If
2468𓀴      on that forbidding
 moor a difficult
 and dangerous quest should
2469𓀴      lie before us, this was at
 least a comrade for whom one might
2470𓀴      venture to take a risk with
 the certainty that he would bravely
2471𓀴      share it.
2472𓀴
2473𓀴      The train pulled up at a
 small wayside station and we all
2474𓀴      descended.
 Outside, beyond the
 low, white fence, a wagonette with
2475𓀴      a pair of cobs was waiting.
 Our coming was evidently a great
2476𓀴      event, for
 station-master and
 porters clustered round us to carry
2477𓀴      out our luggage.
 It was a sweet,
 simple country spot, but I was
2478𓀴      surprised
 to observe that by
 the gate there stood two soldierly
2479𓀴      men in dark uniforms who
 leaned upon their short rifles and
2480𓀴      glanced keenly at us as we
 passed. The coachman, a hard-faced,
2481𓀴      gnarled little
 fellow, saluted
 Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a
2482𓀴      few minutes we were flying
 swiftly down the broad, white road.
2483𓀴      Rolling pasture
 lands curved
 upward on either side of us, and old
2484𓀴      gabled houses
 peeped out from
 amid the thick green foliage, but
2485𓀴      behind the
 peaceful and sunlit
 countryside there rose ever, dark
2486𓀴      against the
 evening sky, the
 long, gloomy curve of the moor,
2487𓀴      broken by the jagged
 and sinister hills.
2488𓀴
2489𓀴      The wagonette
 swung round into
 a side road, and we curved upward
2490𓀴      through deep lanes worn by
 centuries of wheels, high banks on
2491𓀴      either side,
 heavy with dripping
 moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue
2492𓀴      ferns. Bronzing bracken and
 mottled bramble gleamed in the light
2493𓀴      of the sinking sun. Still
 steadily rising, we passed over a
2494𓀴      narrow granite bridge and
 skirted a noisy stream which gushed
2495𓀴      swiftly down,
 foaming and roaring
 amid the grey boulders. Both
2496𓀴      road and stream
 wound up through
 a valley dense with scrub oak
2497𓀴      and fir. At every
 turn Baskerville
 gave an exclamation of
2498𓀴      delight, looking eagerly
 about him and asking countless
2499𓀴      questions. To
 his eyes all seemed
 beautiful, but to me a tinge of
2500𓀴      melancholy lay
 upon the countryside,
 which bore so clearly the
2501𓀴      mark of the
 waning year. Yellow
 leaves carpeted the lanes and
2502𓀴      fluttered down upon us as
 we passed. The rattle of our wheels
2503𓀴      died away
 as we drove through
 drifts of rotting vegetation—sad
2504𓀴      gifts, as it seemed to me,
 for Nature to throw before the
2505𓀴      carriage of the returning
 heir of the Baskervilles.
2506𓀴
2507𓀴      “Halloa!” cried Dr.
 Mortimer, “what is this?”
2508𓀴
2509𓀴      A steep curve of heath-clad
 land, an outlying spur of the moor,
2510𓀴      lay in front of us. On the
 summit, hard and clear like an
2511𓀴      equestrian statue
 upon its pedestal,
 was a mounted soldier, dark
2512𓀴      and stern, his rifle poised
 ready over his forearm. He was
2513𓀴      watching the road
 along which we travelled.
2514𓀴
2515𓀴      “What is this, Perkins?”
 asked Dr. Mortimer.
2516𓀴
2517𓀴      Our driver
 half turned in his
 seat. “There’s a convict escaped
2518𓀴      from Princetown, sir. He’s
 been out three days now, and the
2519𓀴      warders watch
 every road and
 every station, but they’ve had no
2520𓀴      sight of him
 yet. The farmers
 about here don’t like it, sir, and
2521𓀴      that’s a fact.”
2522𓀴
2523𓀴      “Well, I understand
 that they
 get five pounds if they can give
2524𓀴      information.”
2525𓀴
2526𓀴      “Yes, sir, but the chance
 of five pounds is but a poor thing
2527𓀴      compared to the chance of
 having your throat cut. You see, it
2528𓀴      isn’t like any
 ordinary convict.
 This is a man that would stick
2529𓀴      at nothing.”
2530𓀴
2531𓀴      “Who is he, then?”
2532𓀴
2533𓀴      “It is Selden, the
 Notting Hill murderer.”
2534𓀴
2535𓀴      I remembered the case well,
 for it was one in which Holmes had
2536𓀴      taken an interest
 on account
 of the peculiar ferocity of the
2537𓀴      crime and the
 wanton brutality
 which had marked all the actions
2538𓀴      of the assassin.
 The commutation
 of his death sentence had been
2539𓀴      due to some
 doubts as to his
 complete sanity, so atrocious was
2540𓀴      his conduct. Our wagonette
 had topped a rise and in front of us
2541𓀴      rose the huge expanse of
 the moor, mottled with gnarled and
2542𓀴      craggy cairns
 and tors. A cold
 wind swept down from it and set us
2543𓀴      shivering. Somewhere there,
 on that desolate plain, was lurking
2544𓀴      this fiendish man, hiding
 in a burrow like a wild beast, his
2545𓀴      heart full of
 malignancy against
 the whole race which had cast
2546𓀴      him out. It needed but this
 to complete the grim suggestiveness
2547𓀴      of the barren
 waste, the chilling
 wind, and the darkling sky.
2548𓀴      Even Baskerville
 fell silent
 and pulled his overcoat more closely
2549𓀴      around him.
2550𓀴
2551𓀴      We had left
 the fertile country
 behind and beneath us. We looked
2552𓀴      back on it
 now, the slanting
 rays of a low sun turning the
2553𓀴      streams to threads of gold
 and glowing on the red earth new
2554𓀴      turned by
 the plough and the
 broad tangle of the woodlands. The
2555𓀴      road in front
 of us grew bleaker
 and wilder over huge russet and
2556𓀴      olive slopes,
 sprinkled with
 giant boulders. Now and then we
2557𓀴      passed a moorland
 cottage, walled
 and roofed with stone, with no
2558𓀴      creeper to break
 its harsh outline.
 Suddenly we looked down into
2559𓀴      a cuplike
 depression, patched
 with stunted oaks and firs which
2560𓀴      had been twisted and bent
 by the fury of years of storm. Two
2561𓀴      high, narrow
 towers rose over
 the trees. The driver pointed with
2562𓀴      his whip.
2563𓀴
2564𓀴      “Baskerville
 Hall,” said he.
2565𓀴
2566𓀴      Its master
 had risen and was
 staring with flushed cheeks and
2567𓀴      shining eyes. A few minutes
 later we had reached the lodge-gates,
2568𓀴      a maze of fantastic tracery
 in wrought iron, with weather-bitten
2569𓀴      pillars on either
 side, blotched
 with lichens, and surmounted by
2570𓀴      the boars’ heads
 of the Baskervilles.
 The lodge was a ruin of
2571𓀴      black granite
 and bared ribs
 of rafters, but facing it was a new
2572𓀴      building, half constructed,
 the first fruit of Sir Charles’s
2573𓀴      South African gold.
2574𓀴
2575𓀴      Through the
 gateway we passed
 into the avenue, where the wheels
2576𓀴      were again hushed amid the
 leaves, and the old trees shot their
2577𓀴      branches in a sombre tunnel
 over our heads. Baskerville shuddered
2578𓀴      as he looked
 up the long, dark
 drive to where the house glimmered
2579𓀴      like a ghost
 at the farther end.
2580𓀴
2581𓀴      “Was it here?”
 he asked in a low voice.
2582𓀴
2583𓀴      “No, no, the yew alley
 is on the other side.”
2584𓀴
2585𓀴      The young heir glanced
 round with a gloomy face.
2586𓀴
2587𓀴      “It’s no wonder
 my uncle felt
 as if trouble were coming on him in
2588𓀴      such a place as this,” said
 he. “It’s enough to scare any man.
2589𓀴      I’ll have a row of electric
 lamps up here inside of six months,
2590𓀴      and you won’t
 know it again,
 with a thousand candle-power Swan
2591𓀴      and Edison right here
 in front of the hall door.”
2592𓀴
2593𓀴      The avenue
 opened into a broad
 expanse of turf, and the house lay
2594𓀴      before us.
 In the fading light
 I could see that the centre was a
2595𓀴      heavy block
 of building from
 which a porch projected. The whole
2596𓀴      front was
 draped in ivy, with
 a patch clipped bare here and there
2597𓀴      where a window or a coat of
 arms broke through the dark veil.
2598𓀴      From this central block
 rose the twin towers, ancient,
2599𓀴      crenelated,
 and pierced with
 many loopholes. To right and left of
2600𓀴      the turrets
 were more modern
 wings of black granite. A dull light
2601𓀴      shone through
 heavy mullioned
 windows, and from the high chimneys
2602𓀴      which rose from
 the steep, high-angled
 roof there sprang a single
2603𓀴      black column of smoke.
2604𓀴
2605𓀴      “Welcome, Sir Henry!
 Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”
2606𓀴
2607𓀴      A tall man had stepped from
 the shadow of the porch to open the
2608𓀴      door of the wagonette. The
 figure of a woman was silhouetted
2609𓀴      against the yellow light of
 the hall. She came out and helped the
2610𓀴      man to hand down our bags.
2611𓀴
2612𓀴      “You don’t mind my driving
 straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr.
2613𓀴      Mortimer. “My
 wife is expecting me.”
2614𓀴
2615𓀴      “Surely you will stay
 and have some dinner?”
2616𓀴
2617𓀴      “No, I must
 go. I shall probably
 find some work awaiting me. I
2618𓀴      would stay to show you over
 the house, but Barrymore will be a
2619𓀴      better guide
 than I. Good-bye,
 and never hesitate night or day to
2620𓀴      send for me if
 I can be of service.”
2621𓀴
2622𓀴      The wheels
 died away down the
 drive while Sir Henry and I turned
2623𓀴      into the hall, and the door
 clanged heavily behind us. It was a
2624𓀴      fine apartment in which we
 found ourselves, large, lofty, and
2625𓀴      heavily raftered with huge
 baulks of age-blackened oak. In the
2626𓀴      great old-fashioned
 fireplace
 behind the high iron dogs a
2627𓀴      log-fire crackled
 and snapped.
 Sir Henry and I held out our hands
2628𓀴      to it, for
 we were numb from
 our long drive. Then we gazed round
2629𓀴      us at the high, thin window
 of old stained glass, the oak
2630𓀴      panelling,
 the stags’ heads,
 the coats of arms upon the walls,
2631𓀴      all dim and sombre in the
 subdued light of the central lamp.
2632𓀴
2633𓀴      “It’s just
 as I imagined it,”
 said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very
2634𓀴      picture of
 an old family home?
 To think that this should be the
2635𓀴      same hall in which for five
 hundred years my people have lived.
2636𓀴      It strikes me
 solemn to think of it.”
2637𓀴
2638𓀴      I saw his dark face lit up
 with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed
2639𓀴      about him. The light beat
 upon him where he stood, but long
2640𓀴      shadows trailed
 down the walls
 and hung like a black canopy above
2641𓀴      him. Barrymore had returned
 from taking our luggage to our rooms.
2642𓀴      He stood in front of us
 now with the subdued manner of a
2643𓀴      well-trained
 servant. He was
 a remarkable-looking man, tall,
2644𓀴      handsome,
 with a square black
 beard and pale, distinguished
2645𓀴      features.
2646𓀴
2647𓀴      “Would you wish dinner
 to be served at once, sir?”
2648𓀴
2649𓀴      “Is it ready?”
2650𓀴
2651𓀴      “In a very
 few minutes, sir.
 You will find hot water in your
2652𓀴      rooms. My
 wife and I will be
 happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you
2653𓀴      until you have made your
 fresh arrangements, but you will
2654𓀴      understand
 that under the new
 conditions this house will require
2655𓀴      a considerable staff.”
2656𓀴
2657𓀴      “What new conditions?”
2658𓀴
2659𓀴      “I only meant,
 sir, that Sir
 Charles led a very retired life, and
2660𓀴      we were able
 to look after his
 wants. You would, naturally, wish
2661𓀴      to have more company, and
 so you will need changes in your
2662𓀴      household.”
2663𓀴
2664𓀴      “Do you mean that your
 wife and you wish to leave?”
2665𓀴
2666𓀴      “Only when it is quite
 convenient to you, sir.”
2667𓀴
2668𓀴      “But your family
 have been with
 us for several generations, have
2669𓀴      they not? I should be sorry
 to begin my life here by breaking an
2670𓀴      old family connection.”
2671𓀴
2672𓀴      I seemed to
 discern some signs
 of emotion upon the butler’s white
2673𓀴      face.
2674𓀴
2675𓀴      “I feel that also, sir, and
 so does my wife. But to tell the
2676𓀴      truth, sir,
 we were both very
 much attached to Sir Charles, and
2677𓀴      his death gave us a shock
 and made these surroundings very
2678𓀴      painful to us. I fear that
 we shall never again be easy in our
2679𓀴      minds at Baskerville Hall.”
2680𓀴
2681𓀴      “But what do
 you intend to do?”
2682𓀴
2683𓀴      “I have no doubt, sir, that
 we shall succeed in establishing
2684𓀴      ourselves in some business.
 Sir Charles’s generosity has given us
2685𓀴      the means
 to do so. And now,
 sir, perhaps I had best show you to
2686𓀴      your rooms.”
2687𓀴
2688𓀴      A square balustraded
 gallery
 ran round the top of the old hall,
2689𓀴      approached
 by a double stair.
 From this central point two long
2690𓀴      corridors
 extended the whole
 length of the building, from which
2691𓀴      all the bedrooms opened.
 My own was in the same wing as
2692𓀴      Baskerville’s
 and almost next
 door to it. These rooms appeared to
2693𓀴      be much more
 modern than the
 central part of the house, and the
2694𓀴      bright paper and numerous
 candles did something to remove the
2695𓀴      sombre impression which our
 arrival had left upon my mind.
2696𓀴
2697𓀴      But the dining-room
 which opened
 out of the hall was a place of
2698𓀴      shadow and gloom. It was a
 long chamber with a step separating
2699𓀴      the dais where
 the family sat
 from the lower portion reserved for
2700𓀴      their dependents.
 At one end
 a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it.
2701𓀴      Black beams
 shot across above
 our heads, with a smoke-darkened
2702𓀴      ceiling beyond
 them. With rows
 of flaring torches to light it up,
2703𓀴      and the colour
 and rude hilarity
 of an old-time banquet, it might
2704𓀴      have softened;
 but now, when
 two black-clothed gentlemen sat in
2705𓀴      the little circle of light
 thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice
2706𓀴      became hushed
 and one’s spirit
 subdued. A dim line of ancestors,
2707𓀴      in every variety of dress,
 from the Elizabethan knight to the
2708𓀴      buck of the Regency, stared
 down upon us and daunted us by their
2709𓀴      silent company.
 We talked little,
 and I for one was glad when the
2710𓀴      meal was over and we were
 able to retire into the modern
2711𓀴      billiard-room
 and smoke a cigarette.
2712𓀴
2713𓀴      “My word, it isn’t a very
 cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I
2714𓀴      suppose one can tone down
 to it, but I feel a bit out of the
2715𓀴      picture at present. I don’t
 wonder that my uncle got a little
2716𓀴      jumpy if he lived all alone
 in such a house as this. However, if
2717𓀴      it suits you,
 we will retire
 early tonight, and perhaps things
2718𓀴      may seem more cheerful
 in the morning.”
2719𓀴
2720𓀴      I drew aside
 my curtains before
 I went to bed and looked out from
2721𓀴      my window.
 It opened upon the
 grassy space which lay in front of
2722𓀴      the hall door.
 Beyond, two copses
 of trees moaned and swung in a
2723𓀴      rising wind. A half moon
 broke through the rifts of racing
2724𓀴      clouds. In its cold light I
 saw beyond the trees a broken fringe
2725𓀴      of rocks, and the long, low
 curve of the melancholy moor. I
2726𓀴      closed the curtain, feeling
 that my last impression was in
2727𓀴      keeping with the rest.
2728𓀴
2729𓀴      And yet it
 was not quite the
 last. I found myself weary and yet
2730𓀴      wakeful, tossing restlessly
 from side to side, seeking for the
2731𓀴      sleep which would not come.
 Far away a chiming clock struck out
2732𓀴      the quarters of the hours,
 but otherwise a deathly silence lay
2733𓀴      upon the old
 house. And then
 suddenly, in the very dead of the
2734𓀴      night, there came a sound
 to my ears, clear, resonant, and
2735𓀴      unmistakable.
 It was the sob
 of a woman, the muffled, strangling
2736𓀴      gasp of one
 who is torn by an
 uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in
2737𓀴      bed and listened
 intently. The
 noise could not have been far away
2738𓀴      and was certainly
 in the house.
 For half an hour I waited with
2739𓀴      every nerve
 on the alert, but
 there came no other sound save the
2740𓀴      chiming clock and the
 rustle of the ivy on the wall.

2745𓀴Chapter 7.
2746𓀴The Stapletons of Merripit House
2747𓀴
2748𓀴
2749𓀴      The fresh beauty
 of the following
 morning did something to efface
2750𓀴      from our minds the grim and
 grey impression which had been left
2751𓀴      upon both
 of us by our first
 experience of Baskerville Hall. As
2752𓀴      Sir Henry and
 I sat at breakfast
 the sunlight flooded in through
2753𓀴      the high mullioned windows,
 throwing watery patches of colour
2754𓀴      from the coats
 of arms which
 covered them. The dark panelling
2755𓀴      glowed like
 bronze in the golden
 rays, and it was hard to realise
2756𓀴      that this was
 indeed the chamber
 which had struck such a gloom
2757𓀴      into our souls
 upon the evening before.
2758𓀴
2759𓀴      “I guess it is ourselves
 and not the house that we have to
2760𓀴      blame!” said the baronet.
 “We were tired with our journey and
2761𓀴      chilled by our drive, so we
 took a grey view of the place. Now we
2762𓀴      are fresh and well, so
 it is all cheerful once more.”
2763𓀴
2764𓀴      “And yet it
 was not entirely
 a question of imagination,” I
2765𓀴      answered. “Did
 you, for example,
 happen to hear someone, a woman
2766𓀴      I think, sobbing
 in the night?”
2767𓀴
2768𓀴      “That is curious, for I did
 when I was half asleep fancy that I
2769𓀴      heard something
 of the sort.
 I waited quite a time, but there was
2770𓀴      no more of
 it, so I concluded
 that it was all a dream.”
2771𓀴
2772𓀴      “I heard it distinctly, and
 I am sure that it was really the sob
2773𓀴      of a woman.”
2774𓀴
2775𓀴      “We must ask
 about this right
 away.” He rang the bell and asked
2776𓀴      Barrymore whether
 he could account
 for our experience. It seemed
2777𓀴      to me that
 the pallid features
 of the butler turned a shade paler
2778𓀴      still as he listened
 to his master’s question.
2779𓀴
2780𓀴      “There are
 only two women in
 the house, Sir Henry,” he answered.
2781𓀴      “One is the scullery-maid,
 who sleeps in the other wing. The
2782𓀴      other is my wife, and I can
 answer for it that the sound could
2783𓀴      not have come from her.”
2784𓀴
2785𓀴      And yet he lied as he said
 it, for it chanced that after
2786𓀴      breakfast I
 met Mrs. Barrymore
 in the long corridor with the sun
2787𓀴      full upon her face. She was
 a large, impassive, heavy-featured
2788𓀴      woman with a
 stern set expression
 of mouth. But her telltale eyes
2789𓀴      were red and
 glanced at me from
 between swollen lids. It was she,
2790𓀴      then, who
 wept in the night,
 and if she did so her husband must
2791𓀴      know it. Yet he had taken
 the obvious risk of discovery in
2792𓀴      declaring
 that it was not so.
 Why had he done this? And why did
2793𓀴      she weep so
 bitterly? Already
 round this pale-faced, handsome,
2794𓀴      black-bearded man there was
 gathering an atmosphere of mystery
2795𓀴      and of gloom. It was he who
 had been the first to discover the
2796𓀴      body of Sir Charles, and
 we had only his word for all the
2797𓀴      circumstances which led
 up to the old man’s death. Was it
2798𓀴      possible that
 it was Barrymore,
 after all, whom we had seen in
2799𓀴      the cab in Regent Street?
 The beard might well have been the
2800𓀴      same. The cabman
 had described
 a somewhat shorter man, but such
2801𓀴      an impression might easily
 have been erroneous. How could I
2802𓀴      settle the point
 forever? Obviously
 the first thing to do was to
2803𓀴      see the Grimpen
 postmaster and
 find whether the test telegram had
2804𓀴      really been
 placed in Barrymore’s
 own hands. Be the answer what
2805𓀴      it might, I should at least
 have something to report to Sherlock
2806𓀴      Holmes.
2807𓀴
2808𓀴      Sir Henry
 had numerous papers
 to examine after breakfast, so that
2809𓀴      the time was propitious for
 my excursion. It was a pleasant walk
2810𓀴      of four miles
 along the edge
 of the moor, leading me at last to a
2811𓀴      small grey hamlet, in which
 two larger buildings, which proved to
2812𓀴      be the inn and the house of
 Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the
2813𓀴      rest. The postmaster, who
 was also the village grocer, had a
2814𓀴      clear recollection
 of the telegram.
2815𓀴
2816𓀴      “Certainly, sir,” said he,
 “I had the telegram delivered to Mr.
2817𓀴      Barrymore exactly
 as directed.”
2818𓀴
2819𓀴      “Who delivered it?”
2820𓀴
2821𓀴      “My boy here.
 James, you delivered
 that telegram to Mr. Barrymore
2822𓀴      at the Hall last
 week, did you not?”
2823𓀴
2824𓀴      “Yes, father,
 I delivered it.”
2825𓀴
2826𓀴      “Into his own
 hands?” I asked.
2827𓀴
2828𓀴      “Well, he
 was up in the loft
 at the time, so that I could not put
2829𓀴      it into his
 own hands, but I
 gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands,
2830𓀴      and she promised
 to deliver it at once.”
2831𓀴
2832𓀴      “Did you see
 Mr. Barrymore?”
2833𓀴
2834𓀴      “No, sir; I tell
 you he was in the loft.”
2835𓀴
2836𓀴      “If you didn’t see him, how
 do you know he was in the loft?”
2837𓀴
2838𓀴      “Well, surely his own wife
 ought to know where he is,” said the
2839𓀴      postmaster testily. “Didn’t
 he get the telegram? If there is any
2840𓀴      mistake it is for Mr.
 Barrymore himself to complain.”
2841𓀴
2842𓀴      It seemed
 hopeless to pursue
 the inquiry any farther, but it was
2843𓀴      clear that
 in spite of Holmes’s
 ruse we had no proof that
2844𓀴      Barrymore had
 not been in London
 all the time. Suppose that it
2845𓀴      were so—suppose
 that the same
 man had been the last who had seen
2846𓀴      Sir Charles alive, and the
 first to dog the new heir when he
2847𓀴      returned to
 England. What then?
 Was he the agent of others or had
2848𓀴      he some sinister design of
 his own? What interest could he have
2849𓀴      in persecuting
 the Baskerville
 family? I thought of the strange
2850𓀴      warning clipped out of the
 leading article of the _Times_. Was
2851𓀴      that his work
 or was it possibly
 the doing of someone who was
2852𓀴      bent upon counteracting his
 schemes? The only conceivable motive
2853𓀴      was that which
 had been suggested
 by Sir Henry, that if the
2854𓀴      family could be scared away
 a comfortable and permanent home
2855𓀴      would be secured for the
 Barrymores. But surely such an
2856𓀴      explanation
 as that would be
 quite inadequate to account for the
2857𓀴      deep and subtle
 scheming which
 seemed to be weaving an invisible
2858𓀴      net round
 the young baronet.
 Holmes himself had said that no more
2859𓀴      complex case had come to
 him in all the long series of his
2860𓀴      sensational investigations.
 I prayed, as I walked back along the
2861𓀴      grey, lonely road, that my
 friend might soon be freed from his
2862𓀴      preoccupations
 and able to come
 down to take this heavy burden of
2863𓀴      responsibility
 from my shoulders.
2864𓀴
2865𓀴      Suddenly my thoughts were
 interrupted by the sound of running
2866𓀴      feet behind
 me and by a voice
 which called me by name. I turned,
2867𓀴      expecting to
 see Dr. Mortimer,
 but to my surprise it was a
2868𓀴      stranger who
 was pursuing me.
 He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,
2869𓀴      prim-faced
 man, flaxen-haired
 and lean-jawed, between thirty and
2870𓀴      forty years of age, dressed
 in a grey suit and wearing a straw
2871𓀴      hat. A tin
 box for botanical
 specimens hung over his shoulder and
2872𓀴      he carried a
 green butterfly-net
 in one of his hands.
2873𓀴
2874𓀴      “You will,
 I am sure, excuse
 my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he
2875𓀴      as he came
 panting up to where
 I stood. “Here on the moor we are
2876𓀴      homely folk and do not wait
 for formal introductions. You may
2877𓀴      possibly have heard my name
 from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I
2878𓀴      am Stapleton,
 of Merripit House.”
2879𓀴
2880𓀴      “Your net
 and box would have
 told me as much,” said I, “for I
2881𓀴      knew that Mr. Stapleton was
 a naturalist. But how did you know
2882𓀴      me?”
2883𓀴
2884𓀴      “I have been
 calling on Mortimer,
 and he pointed you out to me
2885𓀴      from the window
 of his surgery
 as you passed. As our road lay the
2886𓀴      same way I thought that I
 would overtake you and introduce
2887𓀴      myself. I trust that Sir
 Henry is none the worse for his
2888𓀴      journey?”
2889𓀴
2890𓀴      “He is very
 well, thank you.”
2891𓀴
2892𓀴      “We were all rather afraid
 that after the sad death of Sir
2893𓀴      Charles the
 new baronet might
 refuse to live here. It is asking
2894𓀴      much of a
 wealthy man to come
 down and bury himself in a place of
2895𓀴      this kind, but I need not
 tell you that it means a very great
2896𓀴      deal to the countryside.
 Sir Henry has, I suppose, no
2897𓀴      superstitious
 fears in the matter?”
2898𓀴
2899𓀴      “I do not think
 that it is likely.”
2900𓀴
2901𓀴      “Of course
 you know the legend
 of the fiend dog which haunts the
2902𓀴      family?”
2903𓀴
2904𓀴      “I have heard it.”
2905𓀴
2906𓀴      “It is extraordinary
 how credulous
 the peasants are about here!
2907𓀴      Any number
 of them are ready
 to swear that they have seen such a
2908𓀴      creature upon the moor.” He
 spoke with a smile, but I seemed to
2909𓀴      read in his
 eyes that he took
 the matter more seriously. “The
2910𓀴      story took
 a great hold upon
 the imagination of Sir Charles, and
2911𓀴      I have no doubt that
 it led to his tragic end.”
2912𓀴
2913𓀴      “But how?”
2914𓀴
2915𓀴      “His nerves were so worked
 up that the appearance of any dog
2916𓀴      might have
 had a fatal effect
 upon his diseased heart. I fancy
2917𓀴      that he really
 did see something
 of the kind upon that last night
2918𓀴      in the yew
 alley. I feared that
 some disaster might occur, for I
2919𓀴      was very fond of the old
 man, and I knew that his heart was
2920𓀴      weak.”
2921𓀴
2922𓀴      “How did you know that?”
2923𓀴
2924𓀴      “My friend
 Mortimer told me.”
2925𓀴
2926𓀴      “You think, then, that some
 dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he
2927𓀴      died of fright
 in consequence?”
2928𓀴
2929𓀴      “Have you any
 better explanation?”
2930𓀴
2931𓀴      “I have not come
 to any conclusion.”
2932𓀴
2933𓀴      “Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
2934𓀴
2935𓀴      The words
 took away my breath
 for an instant but a glance at the
2936𓀴      placid face and steadfast
 eyes of my companion showed that no
2937𓀴      surprise was intended.
2938𓀴
2939𓀴      “It is useless
 for us to pretend
 that we do not know you, Dr.
2940𓀴      Watson,” said
 he. “The records
 of your detective have reached us
2941𓀴      here, and you could not
 celebrate him without being known
2942𓀴      yourself.
 When Mortimer told
 me your name he could not deny your
2943𓀴      identity. If you are here,
 then it follows that Mr. Sherlock
2944𓀴      Holmes is
 interesting himself
 in the matter, and I am naturally
2945𓀴      curious to know
 what view he may take.”
2946𓀴
2947𓀴      “I am afraid that I
 cannot answer that question.”
2948𓀴
2949𓀴      “May I ask if he is going
 to honour us with a visit himself?”
2950𓀴
2951𓀴      “He cannot leave
 town at present.
 He has other cases which engage
2952𓀴      his attention.”
2953𓀴
2954𓀴      “What a pity!
 He might throw
 some light on that which is so dark
2955𓀴      to us. But as
 to your own researches,
 if there is any possible
2956𓀴      way in which
 I can be of service
 to you I trust that you will
2957𓀴      command me. If I had any
 indication of the nature of your
2958𓀴      suspicions
 or how you propose
 to investigate the case, I might
2959𓀴      perhaps even now give
 you some aid or advice.”
2960𓀴
2961𓀴      “I assure you
 that I am simply
 here upon a visit to my friend,
2962𓀴      Sir Henry, and that
 I need no help of any kind.”
2963𓀴
2964𓀴      “Excellent!”
 said Stapleton.
 “You are perfectly right to be wary
2965𓀴      and discreet. I am justly
 reproved for what I feel was an
2966𓀴      unjustifiable intrusion,
 and I promise you that I will not
2967𓀴      mention the matter again.”
2968𓀴
2969𓀴      We had come
 to a point where
 a narrow grassy path struck off from
2970𓀴      the road and wound away
 across the moor. A steep,
2971𓀴      boulder-sprinkled hill lay
 upon the right which had in bygone
2972𓀴      days been
 cut into a granite
 quarry. The face which was turned
2973𓀴      towards us
 formed a dark cliff,
 with ferns and brambles growing
2974𓀴      in its niches. From over a
 distant rise there floated a grey
2975𓀴      plume of smoke.
2976𓀴
2977𓀴      “A moderate walk along this
 moor-path brings us to Merripit
2978𓀴      House,” said
 he. “Perhaps you
 will spare an hour that I may have
2979𓀴      the pleasure of introducing
 you to my sister.”
2980𓀴
2981𓀴      My first thought was that I
 should be by Sir Henry’s side. But
2982𓀴      then I remembered the pile
 of papers and bills with which his
2983𓀴      study table
 was littered. It
 was certain that I could not help
2984𓀴      with those. And
 Holmes had expressly
 said that I should study the
2985𓀴      neighbours upon the moor. I
 accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and
2986𓀴      we turned together
 down the path.
2987𓀴
2988𓀴      “It is a wonderful
 place, the
 moor,” said he, looking round over
2989𓀴      the undulating downs, long
 green rollers, with crests of jagged
2990𓀴      granite foaming
 up into fantastic
 surges. “You never tire of the
2991𓀴      moor. You cannot think the
 wonderful secrets which it contains.
2992𓀴      It is so vast, and so
 barren, and so mysterious.”
2993𓀴
2994𓀴      “You know it well, then?”
2995𓀴
2996𓀴      “I have only been here two
 years. The residents would call me a
2997𓀴      newcomer. We came shortly
 after Sir Charles settled. But my
2998𓀴      tastes led
 me to explore every
 part of the country round, and I
2999𓀴      should think that there are
 few men who know it better than I
3000𓀴      do.”
3001𓀴
3002𓀴      “Is it hard to know?”
3003𓀴
3004𓀴      “Very hard.
 You see, for example,
 this great plain to the north
3005𓀴      here with the queer hills
 breaking out of it. Do you observe
3006𓀴      anything remarkable
 about that?”
3007𓀴
3008𓀴      “It would be a rare
 place for a gallop.”
3009𓀴
3010𓀴      “You would naturally think
 so and the thought has cost several
3011𓀴      their lives before now. You
 notice those bright green spots
3012𓀴      scattered thickly over it?”
3013𓀴
3014𓀴      “Yes, they seem more
 fertile than the rest.”
3015𓀴
3016𓀴      Stapleton laughed. “That is
 the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A
3017𓀴      false step
 yonder means death
 to man or beast. Only yesterday I
3018𓀴      saw one of the moor ponies
 wander into it. He never came out. I
3019𓀴      saw his head
 for quite a long
 time craning out of the bog-hole,
3020𓀴      but it sucked him down at
 last. Even in dry seasons it is a
3021𓀴      danger to
 cross it, but after
 these autumn rains it is an awful
3022𓀴      place. And yet I can find
 my way to the very heart of it and
3023𓀴      return alive.
 By George, there
 is another of those miserable
3024𓀴      ponies!”
3025𓀴
3026𓀴      Something brown was rolling
 and tossing among the green sedges.
3027𓀴      Then a long,
 agonised, writhing
 neck shot upward and a dreadful
3028𓀴      cry echoed
 over the moor. It
 turned me cold with horror, but my
3029𓀴      companion’s nerves seemed
 to be stronger than mine.
3030𓀴
3031𓀴      “It’s gone!” said he. “The
 mire has him. Two in two days, and
3032𓀴      many more,
 perhaps, for they
 get in the way of going there in the
3033𓀴      dry weather
 and never know the
 difference until the mire has them
3034𓀴      in its clutches. It’s a bad
 place, the great Grimpen Mire.”
3035𓀴
3036𓀴      “And you say
 you can penetrate it?”
3037𓀴
3038𓀴      “Yes, there are one or two
 paths which a very active man can
3039𓀴      take. I have
 found them out.”
3040𓀴
3041𓀴      “But why should you wish
 to go into so horrible a place?”
3042𓀴
3043𓀴      “Well, you see
 the hills beyond?
 They are really islands cut off
3044𓀴      on all sides
 by the impassable
 mire, which has crawled round them
3045𓀴      in the course
 of years. That
 is where the rare plants and the
3046𓀴      butterflies are, if you
 have the wit to reach them.”
3047𓀴
3048𓀴      “I shall try
 my luck some day.”
3049𓀴
3050𓀴      He looked at
 me with a surprised
 face. “For God’s sake put such
3051𓀴      an idea out
 of your mind,” said
 he. “Your blood would be upon my
3052𓀴      head. I assure
 you that there
 would not be the least chance of
3053𓀴      your coming
 back alive. It is
 only by remembering certain complex
3054𓀴      landmarks that
 I am able to do it.”
3055𓀴
3056𓀴      “Halloa!” I cried.
 “What is that?”
3057𓀴
3058𓀴      A long, low
 moan, indescribably
 sad, swept over the moor. It
3059𓀴      filled the
 whole air, and yet
 it was impossible to say whence it
3060𓀴      came. From a dull murmur it
 swelled into a deep roar, and then
3061𓀴      sank back
 into a melancholy,
 throbbing murmur once again.
3062𓀴      Stapleton looked at me with
 a curious expression in his face.
3063𓀴
3064𓀴      “Queer place,
 the moor!” said he.
3065𓀴
3066𓀴      “But what is it?”
3067𓀴
3068𓀴      “The peasants say it is the
 Hound of the Baskervilles calling for
3069𓀴      its prey.
 I’ve heard it once
 or twice before, but never quite so
3070𓀴      loud.”
3071𓀴
3072𓀴      I looked round,
 with a chill
 of fear in my heart, at the huge
3073𓀴      swelling plain,
 mottled with
 the green patches of rushes. Nothing
3074𓀴      stirred over
 the vast expanse
 save a pair of ravens, which
3075𓀴      croaked loudly
 from a tor behind us.
3076𓀴
3077𓀴      “You are an educated man.
 You don’t believe such nonsense as
3078𓀴      that?” said I. “What do you
 think is the cause of so strange a
3079𓀴      sound?”
3080𓀴
3081𓀴      “Bogs make queer
 noises sometimes.
 It’s the mud settling, or the
3082𓀴      water rising,
 or something.”
3083𓀴
3084𓀴      “No, no, that
 was a living voice.”
3085𓀴
3086𓀴      “Well, perhaps it was. Did
 you ever hear a bittern booming?”
3087𓀴
3088𓀴      “No, I never did.”
3089𓀴
3090𓀴      “It’s a very
 rare bird—practically
 extinct—in England now, but
3091𓀴      all things
 are possible upon
 the moor. Yes, I should not be
3092𓀴      surprised
 to learn that what
 we have heard is the cry of the last
3093𓀴      of the bitterns.”
3094𓀴
3095𓀴      “It’s the
 weirdest, strangest
 thing that ever I heard in my
3096𓀴      life.”
3097𓀴
3098𓀴      “Yes, it’s
 rather an uncanny
 place altogether. Look at the
3099𓀴      hillside yonder. What
 do you make of those?”
3100𓀴
3101𓀴      The whole steep slope was
 covered with grey circular rings of
3102𓀴      stone, a score
 of them at least.
3103𓀴
3104𓀴      “What are
 they? Sheep-pens?”
3105𓀴
3106𓀴      “No, they are
 the homes of our
 worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man
3107𓀴      lived thickly
 on the moor, and
 as no one in particular has lived
3108𓀴      there since,
 we find all his
 little arrangements exactly as he
3109𓀴      left them. These
 are his wigwams
 with the roofs off. You can even
3110𓀴      see his hearth
 and his couch
 if you have the curiosity to go
3111𓀴      inside.
3112𓀴
3113𓀴      “But it is quite a town.
 When was it inhabited?”
3114𓀴
3115𓀴      “Neolithic man—no date.”
3116𓀴
3117𓀴      “What did he do?”
3118𓀴
3119𓀴      “He grazed
 his cattle on these
 slopes, and he learned to dig for
3120𓀴      tin when the
 bronze sword began
 to supersede the stone axe. Look
3121𓀴      at the great
 trench in the opposite
 hill. That is his mark. Yes,
3122𓀴      you will find
 some very singular
 points about the moor, Dr.
3123𓀴      Watson. Oh, excuse me an
 instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”
3124𓀴
3125𓀴      A small fly
 or moth had fluttered
 across our path, and in an
3126𓀴      instant Stapleton
 was rushing
 with extraordinary energy and speed
3127𓀴      in pursuit
 of it. To my dismay
 the creature flew straight for the
3128𓀴      great mire,
 and my acquaintance
 never paused for an instant,
3129𓀴      bounding from
 tuft to tuft behind
 it, his green net waving in the
3130𓀴      air. His grey
 clothes and jerky,
 zigzag, irregular progress made
3131𓀴      him not unlike
 some huge moth
 himself. I was standing watching
3132𓀴      his pursuit with a mixture
 of admiration for his extraordinary
3133𓀴      activity and fear lest he
 should lose his footing in the
3134𓀴      treacherous
 mire, when I heard
 the sound of steps and, turning
3135𓀴      round, found
 a woman near me
 upon the path. She had come from the
3136𓀴      direction
 in which the plume
 of smoke indicated the position of
3137𓀴      Merripit House, but the dip
 of the moor had hid her until she was
3138𓀴      quite close.
3139𓀴
3140𓀴      I could not doubt that this
 was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had
3141𓀴      been told, since ladies of
 any sort must be few upon the moor,
3142𓀴      and I remembered that I had
 heard someone describe her as being a
3143𓀴      beauty. The
 woman who approached
 me was certainly that, and of a
3144𓀴      most uncommon
 type. There could
 not have been a greater contrast
3145𓀴      between brother and sister,
 for Stapleton was neutral tinted,
3146𓀴      with light
 hair and grey eyes,
 while she was darker than any
3147𓀴      brunette whom
 I have seen in
 England—slim, elegant, and tall. She
3148𓀴      had a proud,
 finely cut face,
 so regular that it might have
3149𓀴      seemed impassive
 were it not
 for the sensitive mouth and the
3150𓀴      beautiful dark, eager eyes.
 With her perfect figure and elegant
3151𓀴      dress she was, indeed, a
 strange apparition upon a lonely
3152𓀴      moorland path.
 Her eyes were
 on her brother as I turned, and then
3153𓀴      she quickened
 her pace towards
 me. I had raised my hat and was
3154𓀴      about to make
 some explanatory
 remark when her own words turned
3155𓀴      all my thoughts
 into a new channel.
3156𓀴
3157𓀴      “Go back!” she
 said. “Go straight
 back to London, instantly.”
3158𓀴
3159𓀴      I could only
 stare at her in
 stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at
3160𓀴      me, and she
 tapped the ground
 impatiently with her foot.
3161𓀴
3162𓀴      “Why should
 I go back?” I asked.
3163𓀴
3164𓀴      “I cannot
 explain.” She spoke
 in a low, eager voice, with a
3165𓀴      curious lisp
 in her utterance.
 “But for God’s sake do what I ask
3166𓀴      you. Go back and never
 set foot upon the moor again.”
3167𓀴
3168𓀴      “But I have
 only just come.”
3169𓀴
3170𓀴      “Man, man!” she cried. “Can
 you not tell when a warning is for
3171𓀴      your own good?
 Go back to London!
 Start tonight! Get away from
3172𓀴      this place
 at all costs! Hush,
 my brother is coming! Not a word
3173𓀴      of what I have said. Would
 you mind getting that orchid for me
3174𓀴      among the mare’s-tails
 yonder?
 We are very rich in orchids on the
3175𓀴      moor, though,
 of course, you
 are rather late to see the beauties
3176𓀴      of the place.”
3177𓀴
3178𓀴      Stapleton had abandoned the
 chase and came back to us breathing
3179𓀴      hard and flushed
 with his exertions.
3180𓀴
3181𓀴      “Halloa, Beryl!”
 said he, and
 it seemed to me that the tone of
3182𓀴      his greeting was not
 altogether a cordial one.
3183𓀴
3184𓀴      “Well, Jack,
 you are very hot.”
3185𓀴
3186𓀴      “Yes, I was
 chasing a Cyclopides.
 He is very rare and seldom
3187𓀴      found in the
 late autumn. What
 a pity that I should have missed
3188𓀴      him!” He spoke
 unconcernedly,
 but his small light eyes glanced
3189𓀴      incessantly
 from the girl to me.
3190𓀴
3191𓀴      “You have introduced
 yourselves, I can see.”
3192𓀴
3193𓀴      “Yes. I was
 telling Sir Henry
 that it was rather late for him to
3194𓀴      see the true
 beauties of the moor.”
3195𓀴
3196𓀴      “Why, who do
 you think this is?”
3197𓀴
3198𓀴      “I imagine that it must
 be Sir Henry Baskerville.”
3199𓀴
3200𓀴      “No, no,” said I. “Only a
 humble commoner, but his friend. My
3201𓀴      name is Dr. Watson.”
3202𓀴
3203𓀴      A flush of vexation passed
 over her expressive face. “We have
3204𓀴      been talking at cross
 purposes,” said she.
3205𓀴
3206𓀴      “Why, you had not very much
 time for talk,” her brother remarked
3207𓀴      with the same
 questioning eyes.
3208𓀴
3209𓀴      “I talked as if Dr. Watson
 were a resident instead of being
3210𓀴      merely a visitor,”
 said she.
 “It cannot much matter to him
3211𓀴      whether it is early or late
 for the orchids. But you will come
3212𓀴      on, will you not,
 and see Merripit House?”
3213𓀴
3214𓀴      A short walk brought us to
 it, a bleak moorland house, once the
3215𓀴      farm of some grazier in the
 old prosperous days, but now put into
3216𓀴      repair and
 turned into a modern
 dwelling. An orchard surrounded
3217𓀴      it, but the
 trees, as is usual
 upon the moor, were stunted and
3218𓀴      nipped, and the effect
 of the whole place was mean and
3219𓀴      melancholy.
 We were admitted
 by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated
3220𓀴      old manservant, who seemed
 in keeping with the house. Inside,
3221𓀴      however, there were large
 rooms furnished with an elegance in
3222𓀴      which I seemed to recognize
 the taste of the lady. As I looked
3223𓀴      from their windows at the
 interminable granite-flecked moor
3224𓀴      rolling unbroken
 to the farthest
 horizon I could not but marvel
3225𓀴      at what could have brought
 this highly educated man and this
3226𓀴      beautiful woman
 to live in such a place.
3227𓀴
3228𓀴      “Queer spot
 to choose, is it
 not?” said he as if in answer to my
3229𓀴      thought. “And yet we manage
 to make ourselves fairly happy, do we
3230𓀴      not, Beryl?”
3231𓀴
3232𓀴      “Quite happy,”
 said she, but
 there was no ring of conviction in
3233𓀴      her words.
3234𓀴
3235𓀴      “I had a school,”
 said Stapleton.
 “It was in the north country.
3236𓀴      The work to a man of my
 temperament was mechanical and
3237𓀴      uninteresting,
 but the privilege
 of living with youth, of helping
3238𓀴      to mould those young minds,
 and of impressing them with one’s own
3239𓀴      character
 and ideals was very
 dear to me. However, the fates were
3240𓀴      against us.
 A serious epidemic
 broke out in the school and three
3241𓀴      of the boys died. It never
 recovered from the blow, and much of
3242𓀴      my capital
 was irretrievably
 swallowed up. And yet, if it were
3243𓀴      not for the
 loss of the charming
 companionship of the boys, I
3244𓀴      could rejoice
 over my own misfortune,
 for, with my strong tastes
3245𓀴      for botany
 and zoology, I find
 an unlimited field of work here,
3246𓀴      and my sister is as devoted
 to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.
3247𓀴      Watson, has
 been brought upon
 your head by your expression as you
3248𓀴      surveyed the moor
 out of our window.”
3249𓀴
3250𓀴      “It certainly did cross
 my mind that it might be a little
3251𓀴      dull—less for you, perhaps,
 than for your sister.”
3252𓀴
3253𓀴      “No, no, I am never
 dull,” said she quickly.
3254𓀴
3255𓀴      “We have books, we have our
 studies, and we have interesting
3256𓀴      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is
 a most learned man in his own line.
3257𓀴      Poor Sir Charles was also
 an admirable companion. We knew him
3258𓀴      well and miss him more than
 I can tell. Do you think that I
3259𓀴      should intrude if I were to
 call this afternoon and make the
3260𓀴      acquaintance of Sir Henry?”
3261𓀴
3262𓀴      “I am sure that
 he would be delighted.”
3263𓀴
3264𓀴      “Then perhaps
 you would mention
 that I propose to do so. We may
3265𓀴      in our humble
 way do something
 to make things more easy for him
3266𓀴      until he becomes accustomed
 to his new surroundings. Will you
3267𓀴      come upstairs, Dr. Watson,
 and inspect my collection of
3268𓀴      Lepidoptera? I think it
 is the most complete one in the
3269𓀴      south-west
 of England. By the
 time that you have looked through
3270𓀴      them lunch will
 be almost ready.”
3271𓀴
3272𓀴      But I was eager to get back
 to my charge. The melancholy of the
3273𓀴      moor, the death
 of the unfortunate
 pony, the weird sound which
3274𓀴      had been associated
 with the
 grim legend of the Baskervilles, all
3275𓀴      these things
 tinged my thoughts
 with sadness. Then on the top of
3276𓀴      these more or
 less vague impressions
 there had come the definite
3277𓀴      and distinct
 warning of Miss
 Stapleton, delivered with such
3278𓀴      intense earnestness that I
 could not doubt that some grave and
3279𓀴      deep reason lay behind it.
 I resisted all pressure to stay for
3280𓀴      lunch, and
 I set off at once
 upon my return journey, taking the
3281𓀴      grass-grown path
 by which we had come.
3282𓀴
3283𓀴      It seems,
 however, that there
 must have been some short cut for
3284𓀴      those who
 knew it, for before
 I had reached the road I was
3285𓀴      astounded to
 see Miss Stapleton
 sitting upon a rock by the side
3286𓀴      of the track. Her
 face was beautifully
 flushed with her exertions
3287𓀴      and she held
 her hand to her side.
3288𓀴
3289𓀴      “I have run all the way in
 order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,”
3290𓀴      said she. “I
 had not even time
 to put on my hat. I must not stop,
3291𓀴      or my brother
 may miss me. I
 wanted to say to you how sorry I am
3292𓀴      about the stupid mistake I
 made in thinking that you were Sir
3293𓀴      Henry. Please
 forget the words
 I said, which have no application
3294𓀴      whatever to you.”
3295𓀴
3296𓀴      “But I can’t forget them,
 Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir
3297𓀴      Henry’s friend,
 and his welfare
 is a very close concern of mine.
3298𓀴      Tell me why it was that you
 were so eager that Sir Henry should
3299𓀴      return to London.”
3300𓀴
3301𓀴      “A woman’s
 whim, Dr. Watson.
 When you know me better you will
3302𓀴      understand
 that I cannot always
 give reasons for what I say or
3303𓀴      do.”
3304𓀴
3305𓀴      “No, no. I
 remember the thrill
 in your voice. I remember the look
3306𓀴      in your eyes.
 Please, please,
 be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,
3307𓀴      for ever since
 I have been here
 I have been conscious of shadows
3308𓀴      all round
 me. Life has become
 like that great Grimpen Mire, with
3309𓀴      little green
 patches everywhere
 into which one may sink and with
3310𓀴      no guide to
 point the track.
 Tell me then what it was that you
3311𓀴      meant, and
 I will promise to
 convey your warning to Sir Henry.”
3312𓀴
3313𓀴      An expression
 of irresolution
 passed for an instant over her
3314𓀴      face, but her
 eyes had hardened
 again when she answered me.
3315𓀴
3316𓀴      “You make
 too much of it, Dr.
 Watson,” said she. “My brother and
3317𓀴      I were very much shocked by
 the death of Sir Charles. We knew him
3318𓀴      very intimately,
 for his favourite
 walk was over the moor to our
3319𓀴      house. He was
 deeply impressed
 with the curse which hung over the
3320𓀴      family, and
 when this tragedy
 came I naturally felt that there
3321𓀴      must be some
 grounds for the
 fears which he had expressed. I was
3322𓀴      distressed therefore
 when another
 member of the family came down
3323𓀴      to live here,
 and I felt that
 he should be warned of the danger
3324𓀴      which he will run. That was
 all which I intended to convey.
3325𓀴
3326𓀴      “But what is the danger?”
3327𓀴
3328𓀴      “You know the
 story of the hound?”
3329𓀴
3330𓀴      “I do not believe
 in such nonsense.”
3331𓀴
3332𓀴      “But I do. If you have any
 influence with Sir Henry, take him
3333𓀴      away from a place which has
 always been fatal to his family. The
3334𓀴      world is wide. Why should
 he wish to live at the place of
3335𓀴      danger?”
3336𓀴
3337𓀴      “Because it
 _is_ the place of
 danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature.
3338𓀴      I fear that
 unless you can give
 me some more definite information
3339𓀴      than this it would be
 impossible to get him to move.”
3340𓀴
3341𓀴      “I cannot say
 anything definite,
 for I do not know anything
3342𓀴      definite.”
3343𓀴
3344𓀴      “I would ask
 you one more question,
 Miss Stapleton. If you meant
3345𓀴      no more than
 this when you first
 spoke to me, why should you not
3346𓀴      wish your
 brother to overhear
 what you said? There is nothing to
3347𓀴      which he, or anyone
 else, could object.”
3348𓀴
3349𓀴      “My brother is very anxious
 to have the Hall inhabited, for he
3350𓀴      thinks it is for the good
 of the poor folk upon the moor. He
3351𓀴      would be very
 angry if he knew
 that I have said anything which
3352𓀴      might induce
 Sir Henry to go
 away. But I have done my duty now
3353𓀴      and I will
 say no more. I must
 go back, or he will miss me and
3354𓀴      suspect that I have seen
 you. Good-bye!” She turned and had
3355𓀴      disappeared
 in a few minutes
 among the scattered boulders, while
3356𓀴      I, with my soul full of
 vague fears, pursued my way to
3357𓀴      Baskerville Hall.

3363𓀴First Report of Dr. Watson
3364𓀴
3365𓀴
3366𓀴      From this
 point onward I will
 follow the course of events by
3367𓀴      transcribing my own letters
 to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie
3368𓀴      before me on the table. One
 page is missing, but otherwise they
3369𓀴      are exactly
 as written and show
 my feelings and suspicions of the
3370𓀴      moment more accurately than
 my memory, clear as it is upon these
3371𓀴      tragic events,
 can possibly do.
3372𓀴
3373𓀴      Baskerville
 Hall, October 13th.
3374𓀴
3375𓀴      MY DEAR HOLMES,
3376𓀴
3377𓀴      My previous
 letters and telegrams
 have kept you pretty well up to
3378𓀴      date as to all
 that has occurred
 in this most God-forsaken corner
3379𓀴      of the world.
 The longer one
 stays here the more does the spirit
3380𓀴      of the moor sink into one’s
 soul, its vastness, and also its grim
3381𓀴      charm. When
 you are once out
 upon its bosom you have left all
3382𓀴      traces of modern
 England behind
 you, but, on the other hand, you
3383𓀴      are conscious everywhere
 of the homes and the work of the
3384𓀴      prehistoric people. On all
 sides of you as you walk are the
3385𓀴      houses of these
 forgotten folk,
 with their graves and the huge
3386𓀴      monoliths
 which are supposed
 to have marked their temples. As you
3387𓀴      look at their
 grey stone huts
 against the scarred hillsides you
3388𓀴      leave your own age behind
 you, and if you were to see a
3389𓀴      skin-clad, hairy man crawl
 out from the low door fitting a
3390𓀴      flint-tipped
 arrow on to the
 string of his bow, you would feel
3391𓀴      that his presence there was
 more natural than your own. The
3392𓀴      strange thing is that they
 should have lived so thickly on what
3393𓀴      must always have
 been most unfruitful
 soil. I am no antiquarian,
3394𓀴      but I could
 imagine that they
 were some unwarlike and harried
3395𓀴      race who were
 forced to accept
 that which none other would
3396𓀴      occupy.
3397𓀴
3398𓀴      All this,
 however, is foreign
 to the mission on which you sent me
3399𓀴      and will probably be very
 uninteresting to your severely
3400𓀴      practical mind. I can still
 remember your complete indifference
3401𓀴      as to whether the sun moved
 round the earth or the earth round
3402𓀴      the sun. Let me, therefore,
 return to the facts concerning Sir
3403𓀴      Henry Baskerville.
3404𓀴
3405𓀴      If you have
 not had any report
 within the last few days it is
3406𓀴      because up
 to today there was
 nothing of importance to relate.
3407𓀴      Then a very surprising
 circumstance
 occurred, which I shall tell
3408𓀴      you in due
 course. But, first
 of all, I must keep you in touch
3409𓀴      with some of the other
 factors in the situation.
3410𓀴
3411𓀴      One of these,
 concerning which
 I have said little, is the escaped
3412𓀴      convict upon
 the moor. There
 is strong reason now to believe that
3413𓀴      he has got
 right away, which
 is a considerable relief to the
3414𓀴      lonely householders of this
 district. A fortnight has passed
3415𓀴      since his flight,
 during which
 he has not been seen and nothing
3416𓀴      has been heard
 of him. It is
 surely inconceivable that he could
3417𓀴      have held out upon the moor
 during all that time. Of course, so
3418𓀴      far as his concealment goes
 there is no difficulty at all. Any
3419𓀴      one of these
 stone huts would
 give him a hiding-place. But there
3420𓀴      is nothing to eat unless he
 were to catch and slaughter one of
3421𓀴      the moor sheep.
 We think, therefore,
 that he has gone, and the
3422𓀴      outlying farmers sleep
 the better in consequence.
3423𓀴
3424𓀴      We are four able-bodied men
 in this household, so that we could
3425𓀴      take good
 care of ourselves,
 but I confess that I have had uneasy
3426𓀴      moments when I have thought
 of the Stapletons. They live miles
3427𓀴      from any help.
 There are one
 maid, an old manservant, the sister,
3428𓀴      and the brother, the latter
 not a very strong man. They would be
3429𓀴      helpless in the hands of a
 desperate fellow like this Notting
3430𓀴      Hill criminal
 if he could once
 effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry
3431𓀴      and I were
 concerned at their
 situation, and it was suggested
3432𓀴      that Perkins
 the groom should
 go over to sleep there, but
3433𓀴      Stapleton would
 not hear of it.
3434𓀴
3435𓀴      The fact is
 that our friend,
 the baronet, begins to display a
3436𓀴      considerable
 interest in our
 fair neighbour. It is not to be
3437𓀴      wondered at, for time hangs
 heavily in this lonely spot to an
3438𓀴      active man
 like him, and she
 is a very fascinating and beautiful
3439𓀴      woman. There is something
 tropical and exotic about her which
3440𓀴      forms a singular
 contrast to
 her cool and unemotional brother.
3441𓀴      Yet he also gives the idea
 of hidden fires. He has certainly a
3442𓀴      very marked influence over
 her, for I have seen her continually
3443𓀴      glance at him as she talked
 as if seeking approbation for what
3444𓀴      she said.
 I trust that he is
 kind to her. There is a dry glitter
3445𓀴      in his eyes and a firm set
 of his thin lips, which goes with a
3446𓀴      positive and
 possibly a harsh
 nature. You would find him an
3447𓀴      interesting study.
3448𓀴
3449𓀴      He came over to
 call upon Baskerville
 on that first day, and the
3450𓀴      very next
 morning he took us
 both to show us the spot where the
3451𓀴      legend of
 the wicked Hugo is
 supposed to have had its origin. It
3452𓀴      was an excursion
 of some miles
 across the moor to a place which
3453𓀴      is so dismal that it might
 have suggested the story. We found a
3454𓀴      short valley between rugged
 tors which led to an open, grassy
3455𓀴      space flecked over with the
 white cotton grass. In the middle of
3456𓀴      it rose two great stones,
 worn and sharpened at the upper end
3457𓀴      until they
 looked like the huge
 corroding fangs of some monstrous
3458𓀴      beast. In every
 way it corresponded
 with the scene of the old
3459𓀴      tragedy. Sir Henry was much
 interested and asked Stapleton more
3460𓀴      than once whether
 he did really
 believe in the possibility of the
3461𓀴      interference
 of the supernatural
 in the affairs of men. He spoke
3462𓀴      lightly, but it was evident
 that he was very much in earnest.
3463𓀴      Stapleton
 was guarded in his
 replies, but it was easy to see that
3464𓀴      he said less than he might,
 and that he would not express his
3465𓀴      whole opinion
 out of consideration
 for the feelings of the
3466𓀴      baronet. He
 told us of similar
 cases, where families had suffered
3467𓀴      from some
 evil influence, and
 he left us with the impression that
3468𓀴      he shared the popular
 view upon the matter.
3469𓀴
3470𓀴      On our way
 back we stayed for
 lunch at Merripit House, and it was
3471𓀴      there that Sir Henry made
 the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.
3472𓀴      From the first
 moment that he
 saw her he appeared to be strongly
3473𓀴      attracted by her, and I am
 much mistaken if the feeling was not
3474𓀴      mutual. He referred
 to her again
 and again on our walk home, and
3475𓀴      since then hardly a day
 has passed that we have not seen
3476𓀴      something
 of the brother and
 sister. They dine here tonight, and
3477𓀴      there is some talk of our
 going to them next week. One would
3478𓀴      imagine that
 such a match would
 be very welcome to Stapleton, and
3479𓀴      yet I have more than once
 caught a look of the strongest
3480𓀴      disapprobation in his face
 when Sir Henry has been paying some
3481𓀴      attention to his sister. He
 is much attached to her, no doubt,
3482𓀴      and would
 lead a lonely life
 without her, but it would seem the
3483𓀴      height of selfishness if
 he were to stand in the way of her
3484𓀴      making so brilliant
 a marriage.
 Yet I am certain that he does not
3485𓀴      wish their
 intimacy to ripen
 into love, and I have several times
3486𓀴      observed that he has taken
 pains to prevent them from being
3487𓀴      _tête-à-tête_.
 By the way, your
 instructions to me never to allow
3488𓀴      Sir Henry to
 go out alone will
 become very much more onerous if a
3489𓀴      love affair
 were to be added
 to our other difficulties. My
3490𓀴      popularity
 would soon suffer
 if I were to carry out your orders
3491𓀴      to the letter.
3492𓀴
3493𓀴      The other day—Thursday, to
 be more exact—Dr. Mortimer lunched
3494𓀴      with us. He
 has been excavating
 a barrow at Long Down and has got
3495𓀴      a prehistoric skull which
 fills him with great joy. Never was
3496𓀴      there such a single-minded
 enthusiast
 as he! The Stapletons came
3497𓀴      in afterwards, and the good
 doctor took us all to the yew alley
3498𓀴      at Sir Henry’s
 request to show
 us exactly how everything occurred
3499𓀴      upon that
 fatal night. It is
 a long, dismal walk, the yew alley,
3500𓀴      between two
 high walls of clipped
 hedge, with a narrow band of
3501𓀴      grass upon either side. At
 the far end is an old tumble-down
3502𓀴      summer-house. Halfway down
 is the moor-gate, where the old
3503𓀴      gentleman
 left his cigar-ash.
 It is a white wooden gate with a
3504𓀴      latch. Beyond
 it lies the wide
 moor. I remembered your theory of
3505𓀴      the affair
 and tried to picture
 all that had occurred. As the old
3506𓀴      man stood there
 he saw something
 coming across the moor,
3507𓀴      something
 which terrified him
 so that he lost his wits and ran
3508𓀴      and ran until
 he died of sheer
 horror and exhaustion. There was
3509𓀴      the long,
 gloomy tunnel down
 which he fled. And from what? A
3510𓀴      sheep-dog of the moor? Or a
 spectral hound, black, silent, and
3511𓀴      monstrous?
 Was there a human
 agency in the matter? Did the pale,
3512𓀴      watchful Barrymore
 know more
 than he cared to say? It was all dim
3513𓀴      and vague, but always there
 is the dark shadow of crime behind
3514𓀴      it.
3515𓀴
3516𓀴      One other neighbour I have
 met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
3517𓀴      Frankland,
 of Lafter Hall, who
 lives some four miles to the south
3518𓀴      of us. He is an elderly
 man, red-faced, white-haired, and
3519𓀴      choleric.
 His passion is for
 the British law, and he has spent a
3520𓀴      large fortune
 in litigation.
 He fights for the mere pleasure of
3521𓀴      fighting and is equally
 ready to take up either side of a
3522𓀴      question, so that it is no
 wonder that he has found it a costly
3523𓀴      amusement.
 Sometimes he will
 shut up a right of way and defy the
3524𓀴      parish to make him open it.
 At others he will with his own hands
3525𓀴      tear down some other man’s
 gate and declare that a path has
3526𓀴      existed there from time
 immemorial, defying the owner to
3527𓀴      prosecute him for trespass.
 He is learned in old manorial and
3528𓀴      communal rights,
 and he applies
 his knowledge sometimes in favour
3529𓀴      of the villagers
 of Fernworthy
 and sometimes against them, so
3530𓀴      that he is
 periodically either
 carried in triumph down the
3531𓀴      village street
 or else burned
 in effigy, according to his latest
3532𓀴      exploit. He is said to have
 about seven lawsuits upon his hands
3533𓀴      at present,
 which will probably
 swallow up the remainder of his
3534𓀴      fortune and
 so draw his sting
 and leave him harmless for the
3535𓀴      future. Apart from the law
 he seems a kindly, good-natured
3536𓀴      person, and
 I only mention him
 because you were particular that I
3537𓀴      should send
 some description
 of the people who surround us. He is
3538𓀴      curiously employed
 at present,
 for, being an amateur astronomer,
3539𓀴      he has an excellent
 telescope,
 with which he lies upon the roof
3540𓀴      of his own house and sweeps
 the moor all day in the hope of
3541𓀴      catching a glimpse
 of the escaped
 convict. If he would confine
3542𓀴      his energies
 to this all would
 be well, but there are rumours
3543𓀴      that he intends
 to prosecute
 Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave
3544𓀴      without the consent of the
 next of kin because he dug up the
3545𓀴      Neolithic
 skull in the barrow
 on Long Down. He helps to keep our
3546𓀴      lives from being monotonous
 and gives a little comic relief where
3547𓀴      it is badly needed.
3548𓀴
3549𓀴      And now, having brought you
 up to date in the escaped convict,
3550𓀴      the Stapletons,
 Dr. Mortimer,
 and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let
3551𓀴      me end on
 that which is most
 important and tell you more about
3552𓀴      the Barrymores,
 and especially
 about the surprising development
3553𓀴      of last night.
3554𓀴
3555𓀴      First of all about the test
 telegram, which you sent from London
3556𓀴      in order to make sure that
 Barrymore was really here. I have
3557𓀴      already explained
 that the testimony
 of the postmaster shows that
3558𓀴      the test was worthless and
 that we have no proof one way or the
3559𓀴      other. I told Sir Henry how
 the matter stood, and he at once, in
3560𓀴      his downright
 fashion, had Barrymore
 up and asked him whether he
3561𓀴      had received
 the telegram himself.
 Barrymore said that he had.
3562𓀴
3563𓀴      “Did the boy
 deliver it into
 your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.
3564𓀴
3565𓀴      Barrymore looked surprised,
 and considered for a little time.
3566𓀴
3567𓀴      “No,” said
 he, “I was in the
 box-room at the time, and my wife
3568𓀴      brought it up to me.”
3569𓀴
3570𓀴      “Did you answer
 it yourself?”
3571𓀴
3572𓀴      “No; I told my wife what to
 answer and she went down to write
3573𓀴      it.”
3574𓀴
3575𓀴      In the evening he recurred
 to the subject of his own accord.
3576𓀴
3577𓀴      “I could not
 quite understand
 the object of your questions this
3578𓀴      morning, Sir
 Henry,” said he.
 “I trust that they do not mean that
3579𓀴      I have done anything
 to forfeit your confidence?”
3580𓀴
3581𓀴      Sir Henry had to assure him
 that it was not so and pacify him by
3582𓀴      giving him
 a considerable part
 of his old wardrobe, the London
3583𓀴      outfit having
 now all arrived.
3584𓀴
3585𓀴      Mrs. Barrymore
 is of interest
 to me. She is a heavy, solid
3586𓀴      person, very
 limited, intensely
 respectable, and inclined to be
3587𓀴      puritanical.
 You could hardly
 conceive a less emotional subject.
3588𓀴      Yet I have told you how, on
 the first night here, I heard her
3589𓀴      sobbing bitterly, and since
 then I have more than once observed
3590𓀴      traces of tears
 upon her face.
 Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her
3591𓀴      heart. Sometimes
 I wonder if
 she has a guilty memory which haunts
3592𓀴      her, and sometimes
 I suspect
 Barrymore of being a domestic
3593𓀴      tyrant. I have
 always felt that
 there was something singular and
3594𓀴      questionable in this man’s
 character, but the adventure of last
3595𓀴      night brings all
 my suspicions to a head.
3596𓀴
3597𓀴      And yet it may seem a small
 matter in itself. You are aware that
3598𓀴      I am not a
 very sound sleeper,
 and since I have been on guard in
3599𓀴      this house my slumbers have
 been lighter than ever. Last night,
3600𓀴      about two in the morning,
 I was aroused by a stealthy step
3601𓀴      passing my
 room. I rose, opened
 my door, and peeped out. A long
3602𓀴      black shadow
 was trailing down
 the corridor. It was thrown by a
3603𓀴      man who walked
 softly down the
 passage with a candle held in his
3604𓀴      hand. He was
 in shirt and trousers,
 with no covering to his feet.
3605𓀴      I could merely
 see the outline,
 but his height told me that it
3606𓀴      was Barrymore.
 He walked very
 slowly and circumspectly, and there
3607𓀴      was something indescribably
 guilty and furtive in his whole
3608𓀴      appearance.
3609𓀴
3610𓀴      I have told
 you that the corridor
 is broken by the balcony which
3611𓀴      runs round
 the hall, but that
 it is resumed upon the farther
3612𓀴      side. I waited until he had
 passed out of sight and then I
3613𓀴      followed him.
 When I came round
 the balcony he had reached the
3614𓀴      end of the
 farther corridor,
 and I could see from the glimmer of
3615𓀴      light through
 an open door that
 he had entered one of the rooms.
3616𓀴      Now, all these
 rooms are unfurnished
 and unoccupied so that his
3617𓀴      expedition became
 more mysterious
 than ever. The light shone
3618𓀴      steadily as
 if he were standing
 motionless. I crept down the
3619𓀴      passage as noiselessly as I
 could and peeped round the corner of
3620𓀴      the door.
3621𓀴
3622𓀴      Barrymore was crouching at
 the window with the candle held
3623𓀴      against the
 glass. His profile
 was half turned towards me, and
3624𓀴      his face seemed to be rigid
 with expectation as he stared out
3625𓀴      into the blackness of the
 moor. For some minutes he stood
3626𓀴      watching intently. Then
 he gave a deep groan and with an
3627𓀴      impatient
 gesture he put out
 the light. Instantly I made my way
3628𓀴      back to my room,
 and very shortly
 came the stealthy steps passing
3629𓀴      once more upon their return
 journey. Long afterwards when I had
3630𓀴      fallen into a light sleep I
 heard a key turn somewhere in a lock,
3631𓀴      but I could not tell whence
 the sound came. What it all means I
3632𓀴      cannot guess,
 but there is some
 secret business going on in this
3633𓀴      house of gloom which sooner
 or later we shall get to the bottom
3634𓀴      of. I do not
 trouble you with
 my theories, for you asked me to
3635𓀴      furnish you
 only with facts.
 I have had a long talk with Sir
3636𓀴      Henry this morning, and we
 have made a plan of campaign founded
3637𓀴      upon my observations
 of last
 night. I will not speak about it
3638𓀴      just now,
 but it should make
 my next report interesting reading.

3644𓀴The Light upon the Moor [Second
 Report of Dr. Watson]
3645𓀴
3646𓀴
3647𓀴      Baskerville
 Hall, Oct. 15th.
3648𓀴
3649𓀴      MY DEAR HOLMES,
3650𓀴
3651𓀴      If I was compelled to leave
 you without much news during the
3652𓀴      early days
 of my mission you
 must acknowledge that I am making up
3653𓀴      for lost time,
 and that events
 are now crowding thick and fast
3654𓀴      upon us. In my last report
 I ended upon my top note with
3655𓀴      Barrymore
 at the window, and
 now I have quite a budget already
3656𓀴      which will,
 unless I am much
 mistaken, considerably surprise you.
3657𓀴      Things have
 taken a turn which
 I could not have anticipated. In
3658𓀴      some ways they
 have within the
 last forty-eight hours become much
3659𓀴      clearer and
 in some ways they
 have become more complicated. But I
3660𓀴      will tell you all and
 you shall judge for yourself.
3661𓀴
3662𓀴      Before breakfast
 on the morning
 following my adventure I went
3663𓀴      down the corridor
 and examined
 the room in which Barrymore had
3664𓀴      been on the
 night before. The
 western window through which he had
3665𓀴      stared so intently has, I
 noticed, one peculiarity above all
3666𓀴      other windows
 in the house—it
 commands the nearest outlook on to
3667𓀴      the moor.
 There is an opening
 between two trees which enables one
3668𓀴      from this point of view to
 look right down upon it, while from
3669𓀴      all the other windows it is
 only a distant glimpse which can be
3670𓀴      obtained. It
 follows, therefore,
 that Barrymore, since only this
3671𓀴      window would
 serve the purpose,
 must have been looking out for
3672𓀴      something or
 somebody upon the
 moor. The night was very dark, so
3673𓀴      that I can
 hardly imagine how
 he could have hoped to see anyone.
3674𓀴      It had struck
 me that it was
 possible that some love intrigue was
3675𓀴      on foot. That
 would have accounted
 for his stealthy movements and
3676𓀴      also for the uneasiness
 of his wife. The man is a
3677𓀴      striking-looking
 fellow, very
 well equipped to steal the heart of
3678𓀴      a country
 girl, so that this
 theory seemed to have something to
3679𓀴      support it. That opening of
 the door which I had heard after I
3680𓀴      had returned
 to my room might
 mean that he had gone out to keep
3681𓀴      some clandestine
 appointment.
 So I reasoned with myself in the
3682𓀴      morning, and I tell you the
 direction of my suspicions, however
3683𓀴      much the result may have
 shown that they were unfounded.
3684𓀴
3685𓀴      But whatever
 the true explanation
 of Barrymore’s movements might
3686𓀴      be, I felt that
 the responsibility
 of keeping them to myself
3687𓀴      until I could explain them
 was more than I could bear. I had an
3688𓀴      interview with the baronet
 in his study after breakfast, and I
3689𓀴      told him all
 that I had seen.
 He was less surprised than I had
3690𓀴      expected.
3691𓀴
3692𓀴      “I knew that
 Barrymore walked
 about nights, and I had a mind to
3693𓀴      speak to him
 about it,” said
 he. “Two or three times I have heard
3694𓀴      his steps in
 the passage, coming
 and going, just about the hour
3695𓀴      you name.”
3696𓀴
3697𓀴      “Perhaps then
 he pays a visit
 every night to that particular
3698𓀴      window,” I suggested.
3699𓀴
3700𓀴      “Perhaps he does. If so, we
 should be able to shadow him and see
3701𓀴      what it is
 that he is after.
 I wonder what your friend Holmes
3702𓀴      would do if he were here.”
3703𓀴
3704𓀴      “I believe that he would do
 exactly what you now suggest,” said
3705𓀴      I. “He would
 follow Barrymore
 and see what he did.”
3706𓀴
3707𓀴      “Then we shall
 do it together.”
3708𓀴
3709𓀴      “But surely
 he would hear us.”
3710𓀴
3711𓀴      “The man is
 rather deaf, and
 in any case we must take our chance
3712𓀴      of that. We’ll sit up in
 my room tonight and wait until he
3713𓀴      passes.” Sir Henry rubbed
 his hands with pleasure, and it was
3714𓀴      evident that he
 hailed the adventure
 as a relief to his somewhat
3715𓀴      quiet life upon the moor.
3716𓀴
3717𓀴      The baronet has
 been in communication
 with the architect who
3718𓀴      prepared the plans for Sir
 Charles, and with a contractor from
3719𓀴      London, so
 that we may expect
 great changes to begin here soon.
3720𓀴      There have been decorators
 and furnishers up from Plymouth, and
3721𓀴      it is evident
 that our friend
 has large ideas and means to spare
3722𓀴      no pains or
 expense to restore
 the grandeur of his family. When
3723𓀴      the house is renovated and
 refurnished, all that he will need
3724𓀴      will be a wife
 to make it complete.
 Between ourselves there are
3725𓀴      pretty clear
 signs that this
 will not be wanting if the lady is
3726𓀴      willing, for I have seldom
 seen a man more infatuated with a
3727𓀴      woman than he
 is with our beautiful
 neighbour, Miss Stapleton.
3728𓀴      And yet the
 course of true love
 does not run quite as smoothly as
3729𓀴      one would under
 the circumstances
 expect. Today, for example, its
3730𓀴      surface was
 broken by a very
 unexpected ripple, which has caused
3731𓀴      our friend considerable
 perplexity and annoyance.
3732𓀴
3733𓀴      After the
 conversation which
 I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir
3734𓀴      Henry put on his hat and
 prepared to go out. As a matter of
3735𓀴      course I did the same.
3736𓀴
3737𓀴      “What, are _you_
 coming, Watson?”
 he asked, looking at me in a
3738𓀴      curious way.
3739𓀴
3740𓀴      “That depends
 on whether you
 are going on the moor,” said I.
3741𓀴
3742𓀴      “Yes, I am.”
3743𓀴
3744𓀴      “Well, you know
 what my instructions
 are. I am sorry to intrude,
3745𓀴      but you heard how earnestly
 Holmes insisted that I should not
3746𓀴      leave you,
 and especially that
 you should not go alone upon the
3747𓀴      moor.”
3748𓀴
3749𓀴      Sir Henry put his hand upon
 my shoulder with a pleasant smile.
3750𓀴
3751𓀴      “My dear fellow,”
 said he, “Holmes,
 with all his wisdom, did not
3752𓀴      foresee some
 things which have
 happened since I have been on the
3753𓀴      moor. You understand me? I
 am sure that you are the last man in
3754𓀴      the world who would wish
 to be a spoil-sport. I must go out
3755𓀴      alone.”
3756𓀴
3757𓀴      It put me in a most awkward
 position. I was at a loss what to say
3758𓀴      or what to do, and before I
 had made up my mind he picked up his
3759𓀴      cane and was gone.
3760𓀴
3761𓀴      But when I
 came to think the
 matter over my conscience reproached
3762𓀴      me bitterly
 for having on any
 pretext allowed him to go out of my
3763𓀴      sight. I imagined
 what my feelings
 would be if I had to return to
3764𓀴      you and to
 confess that some
 misfortune had occurred through my
3765𓀴      disregard for
 your instructions.
 I assure you my cheeks flushed
3766𓀴      at the very thought. It
 might not even now be too late to
3767𓀴      overtake him, so I set off
 at once in the direction of Merripit
3768𓀴      House.
3769𓀴
3770𓀴      I hurried along the road at
 the top of my speed without seeing
3771𓀴      anything of
 Sir Henry, until
 I came to the point where the moor
3772𓀴      path branches
 off. There, fearing
 that perhaps I had come in the
3773𓀴      wrong direction after all,
 I mounted a hill from which I could
3774𓀴      command a
 view—the same hill
 which is cut into the dark quarry.
3775𓀴      Thence I saw
 him at once. He
 was on the moor path about a quarter
3776𓀴      of a mile
 off, and a lady was
 by his side who could only be Miss
3777𓀴      Stapleton.
 It was clear that
 there was already an understanding
3778𓀴      between them and that they
 had met by appointment. They were
3779𓀴      walking slowly
 along in deep
 conversation, and I saw her making
3780𓀴      quick little
 movements of her
 hands as if she were very earnest
3781𓀴      in what she
 was saying, while
 he listened intently, and once or
3782𓀴      twice shook
 his head in strong
 dissent. I stood among the rocks
3783𓀴      watching them,
 very much puzzled
 as to what I should do next. To
3784𓀴      follow them
 and break into their
 intimate conversation seemed to
3785𓀴      be an outrage,
 and yet my clear
 duty was never for an instant to
3786𓀴      let him out of my sight.
 To act the spy upon a friend was a
3787𓀴      hateful task.
 Still, I could
 see no better course than to observe
3788𓀴      him from the
 hill, and to clear
 my conscience by confessing to
3789𓀴      him afterwards what I had
 done. It is true that if any sudden
3790𓀴      danger had threatened him I
 was too far away to be of use, and
3791𓀴      yet I am sure that you will
 agree with me that the position was
3792𓀴      very difficult,
 and that there
 was nothing more which I could do.
3793𓀴
3794𓀴      Our friend, Sir Henry, and
 the lady had halted on the path and
3795𓀴      were standing
 deeply absorbed
 in their conversation, when I was
3796𓀴      suddenly aware that I was
 not the only witness of their
3797𓀴      interview. A
 wisp of green floating
 in the air caught my eye, and
3798𓀴      another glance
 showed me that
 it was carried on a stick by a man
3799𓀴      who was moving
 among the broken
 ground. It was Stapleton with his
3800𓀴      butterfly-net. He was very
 much closer to the pair than I was,
3801𓀴      and he appeared
 to be moving
 in their direction. At this instant
3802𓀴      Sir Henry
 suddenly drew Miss
 Stapleton to his side. His arm was
3803𓀴      round her, but it seemed to
 me that she was straining away from
3804𓀴      him with her face averted.
 He stooped his head to hers, and she
3805𓀴      raised one hand
 as if in protest.
 Next moment I saw them spring
3806𓀴      apart and turn
 hurriedly round.
 Stapleton was the cause of the
3807𓀴      interruption.
 He was running
 wildly towards them, his absurd net
3808𓀴      dangling behind
 him. He gesticulated
 and almost danced with
3809𓀴      excitement in front of the
 lovers. What the scene meant I could
3810𓀴      not imagine, but it seemed
 to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir
3811𓀴      Henry, who offered
 explanations,
 which became more angry as the
3812𓀴      other refused
 to accept them.
 The lady stood by in haughty
3813𓀴      silence. Finally
 Stapleton turned
 upon his heel and beckoned in a
3814𓀴      peremptory
 way to his sister,
 who, after an irresolute glance at
3815𓀴      Sir Henry, walked off
 by the side of her brother. The
3816𓀴      naturalist’s angry gestures
 showed that the lady was included in
3817𓀴      his displeasure.
 The baronet
 stood for a minute looking after
3818𓀴      them, and then
 he walked slowly
 back the way that he had come,
3819𓀴      his head hanging, the
 very picture of dejection.
3820𓀴
3821𓀴      What all this meant I could
 not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed
3822𓀴      to have witnessed
 so intimate
 a scene without my friend’s
3823𓀴      knowledge.
 I ran down the hill
 therefore and met the baronet at
3824𓀴      the bottom.
 His face was flushed
 with anger and his brows were
3825𓀴      wrinkled, like one who
 is at his wit’s ends what to do.
3826𓀴
3827𓀴      “Halloa, Watson! Where have
 you dropped from?” said he. “You
3828𓀴      don’t mean to say that you
 came after me in spite of all?”
3829𓀴
3830𓀴      I explained
 everything to him:
 how I had found it impossible to
3831𓀴      remain behind,
 how I had followed
 him, and how I had witnessed
3832𓀴      all that had
 occurred. For an
 instant his eyes blazed at me, but
3833𓀴      my frankness disarmed his
 anger, and he broke at last into a
3834𓀴      rather rueful laugh.
3835𓀴
3836𓀴      “You would have thought the
 middle of that prairie a fairly safe
3837𓀴      place for a
 man to be private,”
 said he, “but, by thunder, the
3838𓀴      whole countryside seems
 to have been out to see me do my
3839𓀴      wooing—and
 a mighty poor wooing
 at that! Where had you engaged a
3840𓀴      seat?”
3841𓀴
3842𓀴      “I was on that hill.”
3843𓀴
3844𓀴      “Quite in the back row, eh?
 But her brother was well up to the
3845𓀴      front. Did you
 see him come out on us?”
3846𓀴
3847𓀴      “Yes, I did.”
3848𓀴
3849𓀴      “Did he ever strike you as
 being crazy—this brother of hers?”
3850𓀴
3851𓀴      “I can’t say
 that he ever did.”
3852𓀴
3853𓀴      “I dare say
 not. I always thought
 him sane enough until today,
3854𓀴      but you can take it from me
 that either he or I ought to be in a
3855𓀴      straitjacket.
 What’s the matter
 with me, anyhow? You’ve lived
3856𓀴      near me for
 some weeks, Watson.
 Tell me straight, now! Is there
3857𓀴      anything that would prevent
 me from making a good husband to a
3858𓀴      woman that I loved?”
3859𓀴
3860𓀴      “I should say not.”
3861𓀴
3862𓀴      “He can’t object
 to my worldly
 position, so it must be myself
3863𓀴      that he has
 this down on. What
 has he against me? I never hurt
3864𓀴      man or woman
 in my life that
 I know of. And yet he would not so
3865𓀴      much as let me touch
 the tips of her fingers.”
3866𓀴
3867𓀴      “Did he say so?”
3868𓀴
3869𓀴      “That, and
 a deal more. I tell
 you, Watson, I’ve only known her
3870𓀴      these few
 weeks, but from the
 first I just felt that she was made
3871𓀴      for me, and
 she, too—she was
 happy when she was with me, and that
3872𓀴      I’ll swear. There’s a light
 in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder
3873𓀴      than words.
 But he has never
 let us get together and it was only
3874𓀴      today for
 the first time that
 I saw a chance of having a few
3875𓀴      words with
 her alone. She was
 glad to meet me, but when she did
3876𓀴      it was not
 love that she would
 talk about, and she wouldn’t have
3877𓀴      let me talk about it either
 if she could have stopped it. She
3878𓀴      kept coming back to it that
 this was a place of danger, and that
3879𓀴      she would never
 be happy until
 I had left it. I told her that
3880𓀴      since I had seen her I was
 in no hurry to leave it, and that if
3881𓀴      she really wanted me to go,
 the only way to work it was for her
3882𓀴      to arrange
 to go with me. With
 that I offered in as many words to
3883𓀴      marry her,
 but before she could
 answer, down came this brother of
3884𓀴      hers, running
 at us with a face
 on him like a madman. He was just
3885𓀴      white with rage, and those
 light eyes of his were blazing with
3886𓀴      fury. What was I doing with
 the lady? How dared I offer her
3887𓀴      attentions which
 were distasteful
 to her? Did I think that
3888𓀴      because I was
 a baronet I could
 do what I liked? If he had not
3889𓀴      been her brother
 I should have
 known better how to answer him. As
3890𓀴      it was I told
 him that my feelings
 towards his sister were such
3891𓀴      as I was not
 ashamed of, and
 that I hoped that she might honour
3892𓀴      me by becoming
 my wife. That
 seemed to make the matter no better,
3893𓀴      so then I
 lost my temper too,
 and I answered him rather more
3894𓀴      hotly than
 I should perhaps,
 considering that she was standing
3895𓀴      by. So it
 ended by his going
 off with her, as you saw, and here
3896𓀴      am I as badly puzzled a man
 as any in this county. Just tell me
3897𓀴      what it all
 means, Watson, and
 I’ll owe you more than ever I can
3898𓀴      hope to pay.”
3899𓀴
3900𓀴      I tried one
 or two explanations,
 but, indeed, I was completely
3901𓀴      puzzled myself.
 Our friend’s
 title, his fortune, his age, his
3902𓀴      character,
 and his appearance
 are all in his favour, and I know
3903𓀴      nothing against
 him unless it
 be this dark fate which runs in his
3904𓀴      family. That
 his advances should
 be rejected so brusquely without
3905𓀴      any reference to the lady’s
 own wishes and that the lady should
3906𓀴      accept the
 situation without
 protest is very amazing. However,
3907𓀴      our conjectures were set
 at rest by a visit from Stapleton
3908𓀴      himself that
 very afternoon.
 He had come to offer apologies for
3909𓀴      his rudeness
 of the morning,
 and after a long private interview
3910𓀴      with Sir Henry in his study
 the upshot of their conversation was
3911𓀴      that the breach is quite
 healed, and that we are to dine at
3912𓀴      Merripit House next
 Friday as a sign of it.
3913𓀴
3914𓀴      “I don’t say
 now that he isn’t
 a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I
3915𓀴      can’t forget
 the look in his
 eyes when he ran at me this morning,
3916𓀴      but I must
 allow that no man
 could make a more handsome apology
3917𓀴      than he has done.”
3918𓀴
3919𓀴      “Did he give
 any explanation
 of his conduct?”
3920𓀴
3921𓀴      “His sister
 is everything in
 his life, he says. That is natural
3922𓀴      enough, and I am glad that
 he should understand her value. They
3923𓀴      have always been together,
 and according to his account he has
3924𓀴      been a very lonely man with
 only her as a companion, so that the
3925𓀴      thought of losing her was
 really terrible to him. He had not
3926𓀴      understood, he said, that
 I was becoming attached to her, but
3927𓀴      when he saw
 with his own eyes
 that it was really so, and that she
3928𓀴      might be taken
 away from him,
 it gave him such a shock that for a
3929𓀴      time he was not responsible
 for what he said or did. He was very
3930𓀴      sorry for all
 that had passed,
 and he recognized how foolish and
3931𓀴      how selfish it was that he
 should imagine that he could hold a
3932𓀴      beautiful woman
 like his sister
 to himself for her whole life. If
3933𓀴      she had to leave him he had
 rather it was to a neighbour like
3934𓀴      myself than to anyone else.
 But in any case it was a blow to him
3935𓀴      and it would take him some
 time before he could prepare himself
3936𓀴      to meet it.
 He would withdraw
 all opposition upon his part if I
3937𓀴      would promise
 for three months
 to let the matter rest and to be
3938𓀴      content with
 cultivating the
 lady’s friendship during that time
3939𓀴      without claiming her love.
 This I promised, and so the matter
3940𓀴      rests.”
3941𓀴
3942𓀴      So there is
 one of our small
 mysteries cleared up. It is
3943𓀴      something to
 have touched bottom
 anywhere in this bog in which we
3944𓀴      are floundering.
 We know now
 why Stapleton looked with disfavour
3945𓀴      upon his sister’s
 suitor—even
 when that suitor was so eligible a
3946𓀴      one as Sir Henry. And now
 I pass on to another thread which I
3947𓀴      have extricated
 out of the tangled
 skein, the mystery of the sobs
3948𓀴      in the night,
 of the tear-stained
 face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the
3949𓀴      secret journey
 of the butler
 to the western lattice window.
3950𓀴      Congratulate
 me, my dear Holmes,
 and tell me that I have not
3951𓀴      disappointed you as an
 agent—that you do not regret the
3952𓀴      confidence which you showed
 in me when you sent me down. All
3953𓀴      these things
 have by one night’s
 work been thoroughly cleared.
3954𓀴
3955𓀴      I have said “by one night’s
 work,” but, in truth, it was by two
3956𓀴      nights’ work,
 for on the first
 we drew entirely blank. I sat up
3957𓀴      with Sir Henry in his rooms
 until nearly three o’clock in the
3958𓀴      morning, but
 no sound of any
 sort did we hear except the chiming
3959𓀴      clock upon
 the stairs. It was
 a most melancholy vigil and ended
3960𓀴      by each of
 us falling asleep
 in our chairs. Fortunately we were
3961𓀴      not discouraged,
 and we determined
 to try again. The next night
3962𓀴      we lowered the lamp and sat
 smoking cigarettes without making the
3963𓀴      least sound.
 It was incredible
 how slowly the hours crawled by,
3964𓀴      and yet we
 were helped through
 it by the same sort of patient
3965𓀴      interest which
 the hunter must
 feel as he watches the trap into
3966𓀴      which he hopes the game may
 wander. One struck, and two, and we
3967𓀴      had almost
 for the second time
 given it up in despair when in an
3968𓀴      instant we both
 sat bolt upright
 in our chairs with all our weary
3969𓀴      senses keenly
 on the alert once
 more. We had heard the creak of a
3970𓀴      step in the passage.
3971𓀴
3972𓀴      Very stealthily we heard it
 pass along until it died away in the
3973𓀴      distance. Then
 the baronet gently
 opened his door and we set out
3974𓀴      in pursuit. Already our man
 had gone round the gallery and the
3975𓀴      corridor was
 all in darkness.
 Softly we stole along until we had
3976𓀴      come into
 the other wing. We
 were just in time to catch a glimpse
3977𓀴      of the tall, black-bearded
 figure, his shoulders rounded as he
3978𓀴      tiptoed down
 the passage. Then
 he passed through the same door as
3979𓀴      before, and
 the light of the
 candle framed it in the darkness and
3980𓀴      shot one single yellow beam
 across the gloom of the corridor. We
3981𓀴      shuffled cautiously towards
 it, trying every plank before we
3982𓀴      dared to put our whole
 weight upon it. We had taken the
3983𓀴      precaution
 of leaving our boots
 behind us, but, even so, the old
3984𓀴      boards snapped
 and creaked beneath
 our tread. Sometimes it seemed
3985𓀴      impossible
 that he should fail
 to hear our approach. However, the
3986𓀴      man is fortunately
 rather deaf,
 and he was entirely preoccupied
3987𓀴      in that which he was doing.
 When at last we reached the door and
3988𓀴      peeped through we found him
 crouching at the window, candle in
3989𓀴      hand, his
 white, intent face
 pressed against the pane, exactly as
3990𓀴      I had seen him
 two nights before.
3991𓀴
3992𓀴      We had arranged
 no plan of campaign,
 but the baronet is a man to
3993𓀴      whom the most direct way is
 always the most natural. He walked
3994𓀴      into the room,
 and as he did
 so Barrymore sprang up from the
3995𓀴      window with a sharp hiss
 of his breath and stood, livid and
3996𓀴      trembling, before us. His
 dark eyes, glaring out of the white
3997𓀴      mask of his face, were full
 of horror and astonishment as he
3998𓀴      gazed from Sir Henry to me.
3999𓀴
4000𓀴      “What are you
 doing here, Barrymore?”
4001𓀴
4002𓀴      “Nothing,
 sir.” His agitation
 was so great that he could hardly
4003𓀴      speak, and
 the shadows sprang
 up and down from the shaking of his
4004𓀴      candle. “It was the window,
 sir. I go round at night to see that
4005𓀴      they are fastened.”
4006𓀴
4007𓀴      “On the second floor?”
4008𓀴
4009𓀴      “Yes, sir,
 all the windows.”
4010𓀴
4011𓀴      “Look here,
 Barrymore,” said
 Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up
4012𓀴      our minds to have the truth
 out of you, so it will save you
4013𓀴      trouble to tell
 it sooner rather
 than later. Come, now! No lies!
4014𓀴      What were you
 doing at that window?”
4015𓀴
4016𓀴      The fellow
 looked at us in a
 helpless way, and he wrung his hands
4017𓀴      together like one who is
 in the last extremity of doubt and
4018𓀴      misery.
4019𓀴
4020𓀴      “I was doing
 no harm, sir. I
 was holding a candle to the window.”
4021𓀴
4022𓀴      “And why were you holding
 a candle to the window?”
4023𓀴
4024𓀴      “Don’t ask
 me, Sir Henry—don’t
 ask me! I give you my word, sir,
4025𓀴      that it is not my secret,
 and that I cannot tell it. If it
4026𓀴      concerned no one but myself
 I would not try to keep it from you.”
4027𓀴
4028𓀴      A sudden idea occurred to
 me, and I took the candle from the
4029𓀴      trembling
 hand of the butler.
4030𓀴
4031𓀴      “He must have been holding
 it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see
4032𓀴      if there is
 any answer.” I held
 it as he had done, and stared out
4033𓀴      into the darkness
 of the night.
 Vaguely I could discern the black
4034𓀴      bank of the
 trees and the lighter
 expanse of the moor, for the
4035𓀴      moon was behind the clouds.
 And then I gave a cry of exultation,
4036𓀴      for a tiny
 pinpoint of yellow
 light had suddenly transfixed the
4037𓀴      dark veil,
 and glowed steadily
 in the centre of the black square
4038𓀴      framed by the window.
4039𓀴
4040𓀴      “There it is!” I cried.
4041𓀴
4042𓀴      “No, no, sir,
 it is nothing—nothing
 at all!” the butler broke in;
4043𓀴      “I assure you, sir—”
4044𓀴
4045𓀴      “Move your light across the
 window, Watson!” cried the baronet.
4046𓀴      “See, the other moves also!
 Now, you rascal, do you deny that it
4047𓀴      is a signal?
 Come, speak up!
 Who is your confederate out yonder,
4048𓀴      and what is this conspiracy
 that is going on?”
4049𓀴
4050𓀴      The man’s
 face became openly
 defiant. “It is my business, and not
4051𓀴      yours. I will not tell.”
4052𓀴
4053𓀴      “Then you leave my
 employment right away.”
4054𓀴
4055𓀴      “Very good, sir.
 If I must I must.”
4056𓀴
4057𓀴      “And you go in disgrace. By
 thunder, you may well be ashamed of
4058𓀴      yourself. Your family has
 lived with mine for over a hundred
4059𓀴      years under
 this roof, and here
 I find you deep in some dark plot
4060𓀴      against me.”
4061𓀴
4062𓀴      “No, no, sir;
 no, not against
 you!” It was a woman’s voice, and
4063𓀴      Mrs. Barrymore,
 paler and more
 horror-struck than her husband,
4064𓀴      was standing
 at the door. Her
 bulky figure in a shawl and skirt
4065𓀴      might have been comic were
 it not for the intensity of feeling
4066𓀴      upon her face.
4067𓀴
4068𓀴      “We have to go, Eliza. This
 is the end of it. You can pack our
4069𓀴      things,” said the butler.
4070𓀴
4071𓀴      “Oh, John,
 John, have I brought
 you to this? It is my doing, Sir
4072𓀴      Henry—all mine. He has done
 nothing except for my sake and
4073𓀴      because I asked him.”
4074𓀴
4075𓀴      “Speak out, then!
 What does it mean?”
4076𓀴
4077𓀴      “My unhappy
 brother is starving
 on the moor. We cannot let him
4078𓀴      perish at
 our very gates. The
 light is a signal to him that food
4079𓀴      is ready for
 him, and his light
 out yonder is to show the spot to
4080𓀴      which to bring it.”
4081𓀴
4082𓀴      “Then your brother is—”
4083𓀴
4084𓀴      “The escaped convict,
 sir—Selden, the criminal.”
4085𓀴
4086𓀴      “That’s the
 truth, sir,” said
 Barrymore. “I said that it was not
4087𓀴      my secret and that I could
 not tell it to you. But now you have
4088𓀴      heard it, and you will see
 that if there was a plot it was not
4089𓀴      against you.”
4090𓀴
4091𓀴      This, then,
 was the explanation
 of the stealthy expeditions at
4092𓀴      night and the
 light at the window.
 Sir Henry and I both stared at
4093𓀴      the woman in amazement. Was
 it possible that this stolidly
4094𓀴      respectable person was of
 the same blood as one of the most
4095𓀴      notorious criminals
 in the country?
4096𓀴
4097𓀴      “Yes, sir,
 my name was Selden,
 and he is my younger brother. We
4098𓀴      humoured him
 too much when he
 was a lad and gave him his own way
4099𓀴      in everything until he came
 to think that the world was made for
4100𓀴      his pleasure,
 and that he could
 do what he liked in it. Then as
4101𓀴      he grew older he met wicked
 companions, and the devil entered
4102𓀴      into him until
 he broke my mother’s
 heart and dragged our name in
4103𓀴      the dirt.
 From crime to crime
 he sank lower and lower until it is
4104𓀴      only the mercy of God which
 has snatched him from the scaffold;
4105𓀴      but to me,
 sir, he was always
 the little curly-headed boy that I
4106𓀴      had nursed
 and played with as
 an elder sister would. That was why
4107𓀴      he broke prison,
 sir. He knew
 that I was here and that we could
4108𓀴      not refuse
 to help him. When
 he dragged himself here one night,
4109𓀴      weary and
 starving, with the
 warders hard at his heels, what
4110𓀴      could we do? We took him in
 and fed him and cared for him. Then
4111𓀴      you returned,
 sir, and my brother
 thought he would be safer on
4112𓀴      the moor than anywhere else
 until the hue and cry was over, so he
4113𓀴      lay in hiding
 there. But every
 second night we made sure if he
4114𓀴      was still there by putting
 a light in the window, and if there
4115𓀴      was an answer
 my husband took
 out some bread and meat to him.
4116𓀴      Every day we
 hoped that he was
 gone, but as long as he was there
4117𓀴      we could not
 desert him. That
 is the whole truth, as I am an
4118𓀴      honest Christian
 woman and you
 will see that if there is blame in
4119𓀴      the matter
 it does not lie with
 my husband but with me, for whose
4120𓀴      sake he has done
 all that he has.”
4121𓀴
4122𓀴      The woman’s words came with
 an intense earnestness which carried
4123𓀴      conviction with them.
4124𓀴
4125𓀴      “Is this true, Barrymore?”
4126𓀴
4127𓀴      “Yes, Sir Henry.
 Every word of it.”
4128𓀴
4129𓀴      “Well, I cannot
 blame you for
 standing by your own wife. Forget
4130𓀴      what I have
 said. Go to your
 room, you two, and we shall talk
4131𓀴      further about this
 matter in the morning.”
4132𓀴
4133𓀴      When they
 were gone we looked
 out of the window again. Sir Henry
4134𓀴      had flung it open, and the
 cold night wind beat in upon our
4135𓀴      faces. Far
 away in the black
 distance there still glowed that one
4136𓀴      tiny point of yellow light.
4137𓀴
4138𓀴      “I wonder he dares,”
 said Sir Henry.
4139𓀴
4140𓀴      “It may be so placed as
 to be only visible from here.”
4141𓀴
4142𓀴      “Very likely. How
 far do you think it is?”
4143𓀴
4144𓀴      “Out by the
 Cleft Tor, I think.”
4145𓀴
4146𓀴      “Not more than
 a mile or two off.”
4147𓀴
4148𓀴      “Hardly that.”
4149𓀴
4150𓀴      “Well, it cannot
 be far if Barrymore
 had to carry out the food to
4151𓀴      it. And he is waiting, this
 villain, beside that candle. By
4152𓀴      thunder, Watson, I am
 going out to take that man!”
4153𓀴
4154𓀴      The same thought
 had crossed
 my own mind. It was not as if the
4155𓀴      Barrymores
 had taken us into
 their confidence. Their secret had
4156𓀴      been forced
 from them. The man
 was a danger to the community, an
4157𓀴      unmitigated
 scoundrel for whom
 there was neither pity nor excuse.
4158𓀴      We were only doing our duty
 in taking this chance of putting him
4159𓀴      back where he could do no
 harm. With his brutal and violent
4160𓀴      nature, others
 would have to
 pay the price if we held our hands.
4161𓀴      Any night, for example, our
 neighbours the Stapletons might be
4162𓀴      attacked by him, and it may
 have been the thought of this which
4163𓀴      made Sir Henry so
 keen upon the adventure.
4164𓀴
4165𓀴      “I will come,” said I.
4166𓀴
4167𓀴      “Then get your revolver and
 put on your boots. The sooner we
4168𓀴      start the better,
 as the fellow
 may put out his light and be
4169𓀴      off.”
4170𓀴
4171𓀴      In five minutes
 we were outside
 the door, starting upon our
4172𓀴      expedition.
 We hurried through
 the dark shrubbery, amid the dull
4173𓀴      moaning of
 the autumn wind and
 the rustle of the falling leaves.
4174𓀴      The night
 air was heavy with
 the smell of damp and decay. Now and
4175𓀴      again the
 moon peeped out for
 an instant, but clouds were driving
4176𓀴      over the face
 of the sky, and
 just as we came out on the moor a
4177𓀴      thin rain began to fall.
 The light still burned steadily in
4178𓀴      front.
4179𓀴
4180𓀴      “Are you armed?” I asked.
4181𓀴
4182𓀴      “I have a hunting-crop.”
4183𓀴
4184𓀴      “We must close in on him
 rapidly, for he is said to be a
4185𓀴      desperate fellow. We shall
 take him by surprise and have him at
4186𓀴      our mercy before
 he can resist.”
4187𓀴
4188𓀴      “I say, Watson,” said the
 baronet, “what would Holmes say to
4189𓀴      this? How
 about that hour of
 darkness in which the power of evil
4190𓀴      is exalted?”
4191𓀴
4192𓀴      As if in answer
 to his words
 there rose suddenly out of the vast
4193𓀴      gloom of the
 moor that strange
 cry which I had already heard upon
4194𓀴      the borders
 of the great Grimpen
 Mire. It came with the wind
4195𓀴      through the silence of the
 night, a long, deep mutter, then a
4196𓀴      rising howl,
 and then the sad
 moan in which it died away. Again
4197𓀴      and again it
 sounded, the whole
 air throbbing with it, strident,
4198𓀴      wild, and menacing.
 The baronet
 caught my sleeve and his face
4199𓀴      glimmered white
 through the darkness.
4200𓀴
4201𓀴      “My God, what’s
 that, Watson?”
4202𓀴
4203𓀴      “I don’t know. It’s a sound
 they have on the moor. I heard it
4204𓀴      once before.”
4205𓀴
4206𓀴      It died away,
 and an absolute
 silence closed in upon us. We stood
4207𓀴      straining our
 ears, but nothing came.
4208𓀴
4209𓀴      “Watson,” said the baronet,
 “it was the cry of a hound.”
4210𓀴
4211𓀴      My blood ran
 cold in my veins,
 for there was a break in his voice
4212𓀴      which told of the sudden
 horror which had seized him.
4213𓀴
4214𓀴      “What do they call
 this sound?” he asked.
4215𓀴
4216𓀴      “Who?”
4217𓀴
4218𓀴      “The folk on
 the countryside.”
4219𓀴
4220𓀴      “Oh, they are
 ignorant people.
 Why should you mind what they call
4221𓀴      it?”
4222𓀴
4223𓀴      “Tell me, Watson.
 What do they say of it?”
4224𓀴
4225𓀴      I hesitated but could
 not escape the question.
4226𓀴
4227𓀴      “They say it is the cry of
 the Hound of the Baskervilles.”
4228𓀴
4229𓀴      He groaned and was
 silent for a few moments.
4230𓀴
4231𓀴      “A hound it
 was,” he said at
 last, “but it seemed to come from
4232𓀴      miles away, over
 yonder, I think.”
4233𓀴
4234𓀴      “It was hard to
 say whence it came.”
4235𓀴
4236𓀴      “It rose and
 fell with the wind.
 Isn’t that the direction of the
4237𓀴      great Grimpen Mire?”
4238𓀴
4239𓀴      “Yes, it is.”
4240𓀴
4241𓀴      “Well, it
 was up there. Come
 now, Watson, didn’t you think
4242𓀴      yourself that
 it was the cry
 of a hound? I am not a child. You
4243𓀴      need not fear
 to speak the truth.”
4244𓀴
4245𓀴      “Stapleton was with me when
 I heard it last. He said that it
4246𓀴      might be the calling
 of a strange bird.”
4247𓀴
4248𓀴      “No, no, it was a hound. My
 God, can there be some truth in all
4249𓀴      these stories?
 Is it possible
 that I am really in danger from so
4250𓀴      dark a cause? You don’t
 believe it, do you, Watson?”
4251𓀴
4252𓀴      “No, no.”
4253𓀴
4254𓀴      “And yet it
 was one thing to
 laugh about it in London, and it is
4255𓀴      another to
 stand out here in
 the darkness of the moor and to hear
4256𓀴      such a cry as
 that. And my uncle!
 There was the footprint of the
4257𓀴      hound beside him as he lay.
 It all fits together. I don’t think
4258𓀴      that I am a coward, Watson,
 but that sound seemed to freeze my
4259𓀴      very blood. Feel my hand!”
4260𓀴
4261𓀴      It was as cold
 as a block of marble.
4262𓀴
4263𓀴      “You’ll be
 all right tomorrow.”
4264𓀴
4265𓀴      “I don’t think
 I’ll get that
 cry out of my head. What do you
4266𓀴      advise that we do now?”
4267𓀴
4268𓀴      “Shall we turn back?”
4269𓀴
4270𓀴      “No, by thunder;
 we have come
 out to get our man, and we will do
4271𓀴      it. We after the convict,
 and a hell-hound, as likely as not,
4272𓀴      after us.
 Come on! We’ll see
 it through if all the fiends of the
4273𓀴      pit were loose
 upon the moor.”
4274𓀴
4275𓀴      We stumbled slowly along in
 the darkness, with the black loom of
4276𓀴      the craggy hills around us,
 and the yellow speck of light burning
4277𓀴      steadily in front. There is
 nothing so deceptive as the distance
4278𓀴      of a light
 upon a pitch-dark
 night, and sometimes the glimmer
4279𓀴      seemed to be far away upon
 the horizon and sometimes it might
4280𓀴      have been
 within a few yards
 of us. But at last we could see
4281𓀴      whence it came, and then we
 knew that we were indeed very close.
4282𓀴      A guttering
 candle was stuck
 in a crevice of the rocks which
4283𓀴      flanked it on each side so
 as to keep the wind from it and also
4284𓀴      to prevent it from being
 visible, save in the direction of
4285𓀴      Baskerville Hall. A boulder
 of granite concealed our approach,
4286𓀴      and crouching
 behind it we gazed
 over it at the signal light. It
4287𓀴      was strange
 to see this single
 candle burning there in the middle
4288𓀴      of the moor,
 with no sign of
 life near it—just the one straight
4289𓀴      yellow flame and the gleam
 of the rock on each side of it.
4290𓀴
4291𓀴      “What shall we do
 now?” whispered Sir Henry.
4292𓀴
4293𓀴      “Wait here. He must be near
 his light. Let us see if we can get a
4294𓀴      glimpse of him.”
4295𓀴
4296𓀴      The words
 were hardly out of
 my mouth when we both saw him. Over
4297𓀴      the rocks,
 in the crevice of
 which the candle burned, there was
4298𓀴      thrust out an evil yellow
 face, a terrible animal face, all
4299𓀴      seamed and scored with vile
 passions. Foul with mire, with a
4300𓀴      bristling beard,
 and hung with
 matted hair, it might well have
4301𓀴      belonged to
 one of those old
 savages who dwelt in the burrows on
4302𓀴      the hillsides.
 The light beneath
 him was reflected in his small,
4303𓀴      cunning eyes
 which peered fiercely
 to right and left through the
4304𓀴      darkness like
 a crafty and savage
 animal who has heard the steps
4305𓀴      of the hunters.
4306𓀴
4307𓀴      Something had
 evidently aroused
 his suspicions. It may have been
4308𓀴      that Barrymore
 had some private
 signal which we had neglected to
4309𓀴      give, or the
 fellow may have
 had some other reason for thinking
4310𓀴      that all was
 not well, but I
 could read his fears upon his wicked
4311𓀴      face. Any instant he might
 dash out the light and vanish in the
4312𓀴      darkness. I sprang
 forward therefore,
 and Sir Henry did the same.
4313𓀴      At the same
 moment the convict
 screamed out a curse at us and
4314𓀴      hurled a rock
 which splintered
 up against the boulder which had
4315𓀴      sheltered us.
 I caught one glimpse
 of his short, squat, strongly
4316𓀴      built figure
 as he sprang to
 his feet and turned to run. At the
4317𓀴      same moment
 by a lucky chance
 the moon broke through the clouds.
4318𓀴      We rushed over the brow of
 the hill, and there was our man
4319𓀴      running with
 great speed down
 the other side, springing over the
4320𓀴      stones in his way with the
 activity of a mountain goat. A lucky
4321𓀴      long shot of my revolver
 might have crippled him, but I had
4322𓀴      brought it only
 to defend myself
 if attacked and not to shoot an
4323𓀴      unarmed man
 who was running away.
4324𓀴
4325𓀴      We were both swift runners
 and in fairly good training, but we
4326𓀴      soon found that
 we had no chance
 of overtaking him. We saw him
4327𓀴      for a long time
 in the moonlight
 until he was only a small speck
4328𓀴      moving swiftly
 among the boulders
 upon the side of a distant
4329𓀴      hill. We ran and ran until
 we were completely blown, but the
4330𓀴      space between us grew ever
 wider. Finally we stopped and sat
4331𓀴      panting on two rocks, while
 we watched him disappearing in the
4332𓀴      distance.
4333𓀴
4334𓀴      And it was
 at this moment that
 there occurred a most strange and
4335𓀴      unexpected
 thing. We had risen
 from our rocks and were turning to
4336𓀴      go home, having
 abandoned the
 hopeless chase. The moon was low
4337𓀴      upon the right,
 and the jagged
 pinnacle of a granite tor stood up
4338𓀴      against the lower curve of
 its silver disc. There, outlined as
4339𓀴      black as an ebony statue on
 that shining background, I saw the
4340𓀴      figure of a man upon the
 tor. Do not think that it was a
4341𓀴      delusion, Holmes.
 I assure you
 that I have never in my life seen
4342𓀴      anything more
 clearly. As far
 as I could judge, the figure was
4343𓀴      that of a tall, thin man.
 He stood with his legs a little
4344𓀴      separated, his arms folded,
 his head bowed, as if he were
4345𓀴      brooding over that enormous
 wilderness of peat and granite which
4346𓀴      lay before him. He might
 have been the very spirit of that
4347𓀴      terrible place.
 It was not the
 convict. This man was far from the
4348𓀴      place where the latter had
 disappeared. Besides, he was a much
4349𓀴      taller man. With a cry of
 surprise I pointed him out to the
4350𓀴      baronet, but in the instant
 during which I had turned to grasp
4351𓀴      his arm the
 man was gone. There
 was the sharp pinnacle of granite
4352𓀴      still cutting
 the lower edge
 of the moon, but its peak bore no
4353𓀴      trace of that silent
 and motionless figure.
4354𓀴
4355𓀴      I wished to
 go in that direction
 and to search the tor, but it
4356𓀴      was some distance away. The
 baronet’s nerves were still quivering
4357𓀴      from that
 cry, which recalled
 the dark story of his family, and
4358𓀴      he was not in
 the mood for fresh
 adventures. He had not seen this
4359𓀴      lonely man upon the tor and
 could not feel the thrill which his
4360𓀴      strange presence
 and his commanding
 attitude had given to me. “A
4361𓀴      warder, no doubt,” said he.
 “The moor has been thick with them
4362𓀴      since this fellow escaped.”
 Well, perhaps his explanation may be
4363𓀴      the right one, but I should
 like to have some further proof of
4364𓀴      it. Today we
 mean to communicate
 to the Princetown people where
4365𓀴      they should look
 for their missing
 man, but it is hard lines that
4366𓀴      we have not
 actually had the
 triumph of bringing him back as our
4367𓀴      own prisoner.
 Such are the adventures
 of last night, and you must
4368𓀴      acknowledge,
 my dear Holmes,
 that I have done you very well in
4369𓀴      the matter
 of a report. Much
 of what I tell you is no doubt quite
4370𓀴      irrelevant,
 but still I feel
 that it is best that I should let
4371𓀴      you have all
 the facts and leave
 you to select for yourself those
4372𓀴      which will
 be of most service
 to you in helping you to your
4373𓀴      conclusions.
 We are certainly
 making some progress. So far as the
4374𓀴      Barrymores go we have found
 the motive of their actions, and that
4375𓀴      has cleared
 up the situation
 very much. But the moor with its
4376𓀴      mysteries and
 its strange inhabitants
 remains as inscrutable as
4377𓀴      ever. Perhaps in my next I
 may be able to throw some light upon
4378𓀴      this also.
 Best of all would
 it be if you could come down to us.
4379𓀴      In any case
 you will hear from
 me again in the course of the next
4380𓀴      few days.

4386𓀴Extract from the
 Diary of Dr. Watson
4387𓀴
4388𓀴
4389𓀴      So far I have been able to
 quote from the reports which I have
4390𓀴      forwarded
 during these early
 days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,
4391𓀴      however, I have arrived at
 a point in my narrative where I am
4392𓀴      compelled to abandon this
 method and to trust once more to my
4393𓀴      recollections, aided by the
 diary which I kept at the time. A few
4394𓀴      extracts from
 the latter will
 carry me on to those scenes which
4395𓀴      are indelibly
 fixed in every
 detail upon my memory. I proceed,
4396𓀴      then, from
 the morning which
 followed our abortive chase of the
4397𓀴      convict and
 our other strange
 experiences upon the moor.
4398𓀴
4399𓀴      _October_
 16_th_.—A dull and
 foggy day with a drizzle of rain.
4400𓀴      The house is banked in with
 rolling clouds, which rise now and
4401𓀴      then to show
 the dreary curves
 of the moor, with thin, silver
4402𓀴      veins upon the sides of the
 hills, and the distant boulders
4403𓀴      gleaming where
 the light strikes
 upon their wet faces. It is
4404𓀴      melancholy outside and in.
 The baronet is in a black reaction
4405𓀴      after the
 excitements of the
 night. I am conscious myself of a
4406𓀴      weight at my
 heart and a feeling
 of impending danger—ever present
4407𓀴      danger, which
 is the more terrible
 because I am unable to define
4408𓀴      it.
4409𓀴
4410𓀴      And have I not cause for
 such a feeling? Consider the long
4411𓀴      sequence of incidents which
 have all pointed to some sinister
4412𓀴      influence which is at work
 around us. There is the death of the
4413𓀴      last occupant of the Hall,
 fulfilling so exactly the conditions
4414𓀴      of the family legend, and
 there are the repeated reports from
4415𓀴      peasants of the appearance
 of a strange creature upon the moor.
4416𓀴      Twice I have
 with my own ears
 heard the sound which resembled the
4417𓀴      distant baying
 of a hound. It
 is incredible, impossible, that it
4418𓀴      should really
 be outside the
 ordinary laws of nature. A spectral
4419𓀴      hound which leaves material
 footmarks and fills the air with its
4420𓀴      howling is surely not to be
 thought of. Stapleton may fall in
4421𓀴      with such
 a superstition, and
 Mortimer also, but if I have one
4422𓀴      quality upon
 earth it is common
 sense, and nothing will persuade
4423𓀴      me to believe
 in such a thing.
 To do so would be to descend to
4424𓀴      the level of
 these poor peasants,
 who are not content with a mere
4425𓀴      fiend dog but
 must needs describe
 him with hell-fire shooting
4426𓀴      from his mouth
 and eyes. Holmes
 would not listen to such fancies,
4427𓀴      and I am his
 agent. But facts
 are facts, and I have twice heard
4428𓀴      this crying upon the moor.
 Suppose that there were really some
4429𓀴      huge hound loose upon it;
 that would go far to explain
4430𓀴      everything. But where could
 such a hound lie concealed, where did
4431𓀴      it get its food, where did
 it come from, how was it that no one
4432𓀴      saw it by day?
 It must be confessed
 that the natural explanation
4433𓀴      offers almost
 as many difficulties
 as the other. And always,
4434𓀴      apart from the hound, there
 is the fact of the human agency in
4435𓀴      London, the man in the cab,
 and the letter which warned Sir Henry
4436𓀴      against the
 moor. This at least
 was real, but it might have been
4437𓀴      the work of
 a protecting friend
 as easily as of an enemy. Where
4438𓀴      is that friend
 or enemy now?
 Has he remained in London, or has he
4439𓀴      followed us
 down here? Could
 he—could he be the stranger whom I
4440𓀴      saw upon the tor?
4441𓀴
4442𓀴      It is true that I have had
 only the one glance at him, and yet
4443𓀴      there are some
 things to which
 I am ready to swear. He is no one
4444𓀴      whom I have seen down here,
 and I have now met all the
4445𓀴      neighbours.
 The figure was far
 taller than that of Stapleton, far
4446𓀴      thinner than
 that of Frankland.
 Barrymore it might possibly have
4447𓀴      been, but we had left him
 behind us, and I am certain that he
4448𓀴      could not have followed us.
 A stranger then is still dogging us,
4449𓀴      just as a
 stranger dogged us
 in London. We have never shaken him
4450𓀴      off. If I
 could lay my hands
 upon that man, then at last we might
4451𓀴      find ourselves
 at the end of
 all our difficulties. To this one
4452𓀴      purpose I must now
 devote all my energies.
4453𓀴
4454𓀴      My first impulse
 was to tell
 Sir Henry all my plans. My second
4455𓀴      and wisest one is to play
 my own game and speak as little as
4456𓀴      possible to
 anyone. He is silent
 and distrait. His nerves have
4457𓀴      been strangely
 shaken by that
 sound upon the moor. I will say
4458𓀴      nothing to add
 to his anxieties,
 but I will take my own steps to
4459𓀴      attain my own end.
4460𓀴
4461𓀴      We had a small scene this
 morning after breakfast. Barrymore
4462𓀴      asked leave
 to speak with Sir
 Henry, and they were closeted in
4463𓀴      his study some little time.
 Sitting in the billiard-room I more
4464𓀴      than once
 heard the sound of
 voices raised, and I had a pretty
4465𓀴      good idea
 what the point was
 which was under discussion. After a
4466𓀴      time the baronet opened his
 door and called for me. “Barrymore
4467𓀴      considers that
 he has a grievance,”
 he said. “He thinks that it
4468𓀴      was unfair
 on our part to hunt
 his brother-in-law down when he,
4469𓀴      of his own free will,
 had told us the secret.”
4470𓀴
4471𓀴      The butler
 was standing very
 pale but very collected before us.
4472𓀴
4473𓀴      “I may have
 spoken too warmly,
 sir,” said he, “and if I have, I
4474𓀴      am sure that
 I beg your pardon.
 At the same time, I was very much
4475𓀴      surprised when I heard you
 two gentlemen come back this morning
4476𓀴      and learned
 that you had been
 chasing Selden. The poor fellow has
4477𓀴      enough to fight
 against without
 my putting more upon his track.”
4478𓀴
4479𓀴      “If you had told us of your
 own free will it would have been a
4480𓀴      different thing,”
 said the baronet,
 “you only told us, or rather
4481𓀴      your wife
 only told us, when
 it was forced from you and you could
4482𓀴      not help yourself.”
4483𓀴
4484𓀴      “I didn’t think you would
 have taken advantage of it, Sir
4485𓀴      Henry—indeed I didn’t.”
4486𓀴
4487𓀴      “The man is
 a public danger.
 There are lonely houses scattered
4488𓀴      over the moor,
 and he is a fellow
 who would stick at nothing. You
4489𓀴      only want to get a glimpse
 of his face to see that. Look at Mr.
4490𓀴      Stapleton’s
 house, for example,
 with no one but himself to defend
4491𓀴      it. There’s
 no safety for anyone
 until he is under lock and key.”
4492𓀴
4493𓀴      “He’ll break into no house,
 sir. I give you my solemn word upon
4494𓀴      that. But he
 will never trouble
 anyone in this country again. I
4495𓀴      assure you, Sir Henry, that
 in a very few days the necessary
4496𓀴      arrangements will have been
 made and he will be on his way to
4497𓀴      South America.
 For God’s sake,
 sir, I beg of you not to let the
4498𓀴      police know
 that he is still
 on the moor. They have given up the
4499𓀴      chase there, and he can lie
 quiet until the ship is ready for
4500𓀴      him. You can’t tell on him
 without getting my wife and me into
4501𓀴      trouble. I beg you, sir,
 to say nothing to the police.”
4502𓀴
4503𓀴      “What do you say, Watson?”
4504𓀴
4505𓀴      I shrugged
 my shoulders. “If
 he were safely out of the country it
4506𓀴      would relieve the
 tax-payer of a burden.”
4507𓀴
4508𓀴      “But how about the chance
 of his holding someone up before he
4509𓀴      goes?”
4510𓀴
4511𓀴      “He would
 not do anything so
 mad, sir. We have provided him with
4512𓀴      all that he
 can want. To commit
 a crime would be to show where he
4513𓀴      was hiding.”
4514𓀴
4515𓀴      “That is true,” said
 Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore—”
4516𓀴
4517𓀴      “God bless
 you, sir, and thank
 you from my heart! It would have
4518𓀴      killed my poor wife
 had he been taken again.”
4519𓀴
4520𓀴      “I guess we are
 aiding and abetting
 a felony, Watson? But, after
4521𓀴      what we have
 heard I don’t feel
 as if I could give the man up, so
4522𓀴      there is an end of it. All
 right, Barrymore, you can go.”
4523𓀴
4524𓀴      With a few broken words of
 gratitude the man turned, but he
4525𓀴      hesitated
 and then came back.
4526𓀴
4527𓀴      “You’ve been so kind to us,
 sir, that I should like to do the
4528𓀴      best I can
 for you in return.
 I know something, Sir Henry, and
4529𓀴      perhaps I should have said
 it before, but it was long after the
4530𓀴      inquest that
 I found it out.
 I’ve never breathed a word about it
4531𓀴      yet to mortal man. It’s
 about poor Sir Charles’s death.”
4532𓀴
4533𓀴      The baronet and I were both
 upon our feet. “Do you know how he
4534𓀴      died?”
4535𓀴
4536𓀴      “No, sir,
 I don’t know that.”
4537𓀴
4538𓀴      “What then?”
4539𓀴
4540𓀴      “I know why he was at the
 gate at that hour. It was to meet a
4541𓀴      woman.”
4542𓀴
4543𓀴      “To meet a woman! He?”
4544𓀴
4545𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
4546𓀴
4547𓀴      “And the woman’s name?”
4548𓀴
4549𓀴      “I can’t give you the name,
 sir, but I can give you the initials.
4550𓀴      Her initials were L. L.”
4551𓀴
4552𓀴      “How do you know
 this, Barrymore?”
4553𓀴
4554𓀴      “Well, Sir
 Henry, your uncle
 had a letter that morning. He had
4555𓀴      usually a
 great many letters,
 for he was a public man and well
4556𓀴      known for
 his kind heart, so
 that everyone who was in trouble was
4557𓀴      glad to turn
 to him. But that
 morning, as it chanced, there was
4558𓀴      only this one letter, so I
 took the more notice of it. It was
4559𓀴      from Coombe Tracey, and it
 was addressed in a woman’s hand.”
4560𓀴
4561𓀴      “Well?”
4562𓀴
4563𓀴      “Well, sir,
 I thought no more
 of the matter, and never would have
4564𓀴      done had it not been for my
 wife. Only a few weeks ago she was
4565𓀴      cleaning out
 Sir Charles’s study—it
 had never been touched since
4566𓀴      his death—and she found the
 ashes of a burned letter in the back
4567𓀴      of the grate.
 The greater part
 of it was charred to pieces, but
4568𓀴      one little slip, the end
 of a page, hung together, and the
4569𓀴      writing could
 still be read,
 though it was grey on a black
4570𓀴      ground. It seemed to us to
 be a postscript at the end of the
4571𓀴      letter and
 it said: ‘Please,
 please, as you are a gentleman, burn
4572𓀴      this letter, and be at the
 gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were
4573𓀴      signed the initials L. L.”
4574𓀴
4575𓀴      “Have you got that slip?”
4576𓀴
4577𓀴      “No, sir, it crumbled
 all to bits after we moved it.”
4578𓀴
4579𓀴      “Had Sir Charles
 received any
 other letters in the same writing?”
4580𓀴
4581𓀴      “Well, sir,
 I took no particular
 notice of his letters. I should
4582𓀴      not have noticed this one,
 only it happened to come alone.”
4583𓀴
4584𓀴      “And you have
 no idea who L. L. is?”
4585𓀴
4586𓀴      “No, sir. No
 more than you have.
 But I expect if we could lay our
4587𓀴      hands upon
 that lady we should
 know more about Sir Charles’s
4588𓀴      death.”
4589𓀴
4590𓀴      “I cannot understand,
 Barrymore,
 how you came to conceal this
4591𓀴      important information.”
4592𓀴
4593𓀴      “Well, sir,
 it was immediately
 after that our own trouble came to
4594𓀴      us. And then again, sir, we
 were both of us very fond of Sir
4595𓀴      Charles, as
 we well might be
 considering all that he has done for
4596𓀴      us. To rake
 this up couldn’t
 help our poor master, and it’s well
4597𓀴      to go carefully
 when there’s
 a lady in the case. Even the best of
4598𓀴      us—”
4599𓀴
4600𓀴      “You thought it might
 injure his reputation?”
4601𓀴
4602𓀴      “Well, sir,
 I thought no good
 could come of it. But now you have
4603𓀴      been kind to us, and I feel
 as if it would be treating you
4604𓀴      unfairly not to tell you
 all that I know about the matter.”
4605𓀴
4606𓀴      “Very good, Barrymore; you
 can go.” When the butler had left us
4607𓀴      Sir Henry turned
 to me. “Well,
 Watson, what do you think of this
4608𓀴      new light?”
4609𓀴
4610𓀴      “It seems to
 leave the darkness
 rather blacker than before.”
4611𓀴
4612𓀴      “So I think. But if we can
 only trace L. L. it should clear up
4613𓀴      the whole business. We have
 gained that much. We know that there
4614𓀴      is someone
 who has the facts
 if we can only find her. What do you
4615𓀴      think we should do?”
4616𓀴
4617𓀴      “Let Holmes
 know all about it
 at once. It will give him the clue
4618𓀴      for which he
 has been seeking.
 I am much mistaken if it does not
4619𓀴      bring him down.”
4620𓀴
4621𓀴      I went at
 once to my room and
 drew up my report of the morning’s
4622𓀴      conversation for Holmes. It
 was evident to me that he had been
4623𓀴      very busy of late, for the
 notes which I had from Baker Street
4624𓀴      were few and short, with no
 comments upon the information which I
4625𓀴      had supplied and hardly any
 reference to my mission. No doubt his
4626𓀴      blackmailing
 case is absorbing
 all his faculties. And yet this
4627𓀴      new factor
 must surely arrest
 his attention and renew his
4628𓀴      interest. I wish
 that he were here.
4629𓀴
4630𓀴      _October_ 17_th_.—All
 day today
 the rain poured down, rustling on
4631𓀴      the ivy and
 dripping from the
 eaves. I thought of the convict out
4632𓀴      upon the bleak,
 cold, shelterless
 moor. Poor devil! Whatever his
4633𓀴      crimes, he has
 suffered something
 to atone for them. And then I
4634𓀴      thought of
 that other one—the
 face in the cab, the figure against
4635𓀴      the moon.
 Was he also out in
 that deluged—the unseen watcher, the
4636𓀴      man of darkness?
 In the evening
 I put on my waterproof and I
4637𓀴      walked far upon the sodden
 moor, full of dark imaginings, the
4638𓀴      rain beating
 upon my face and
 the wind whistling about my ears.
4639𓀴      God help those
 who wander into
 the great mire now, for even the
4640𓀴      firm uplands are becoming a
 morass. I found the black tor upon
4641𓀴      which I had
 seen the solitary
 watcher, and from its craggy summit
4642𓀴      I looked out myself across
 the melancholy downs. Rain squalls
4643𓀴      drifted across their russet
 face, and the heavy, slate-coloured
4644𓀴      clouds hung low
 over the landscape,
 trailing in grey wreaths down
4645𓀴      the sides of the fantastic
 hills. In the distant hollow on the
4646𓀴      left, half
 hidden by the mist,
 the two thin towers of Baskerville
4647𓀴      Hall rose above
 the trees. They
 were the only signs of human life
4648𓀴      which I could
 see, save only
 those prehistoric huts which lay
4649𓀴      thickly upon
 the slopes of the
 hills. Nowhere was there any trace
4650𓀴      of that lonely
 man whom I had
 seen on the same spot two nights
4651𓀴      before.
4652𓀴
4653𓀴      As I walked
 back I was overtaken
 by Dr. Mortimer driving in his
4654𓀴      dog-cart over
 a rough moorland
 track which led from the outlying
4655𓀴      farmhouse of Foulmire. He
 has been very attentive to us, and
4656𓀴      hardly a day
 has passed that
 he has not called at the Hall to see
4657𓀴      how we were getting on. He
 insisted upon my climbing into his
4658𓀴      dog-cart, and he gave me
 a lift homeward. I found him much
4659𓀴      troubled over
 the disappearance
 of his little spaniel. It had
4660𓀴      wandered on to the moor and
 had never come back. I gave him such
4661𓀴      consolation as I might, but
 I thought of the pony on the Grimpen
4662𓀴      Mire, and
 I do not fancy that
 he will see his little dog again.
4663𓀴
4664𓀴      “By the way,
 Mortimer,” said
 I as we jolted along the rough road,
4665𓀴      “I suppose
 there are few people
 living within driving distance of
4666𓀴      this whom you do not know?”
4667𓀴
4668𓀴      “Hardly any, I think.”
4669𓀴
4670𓀴      “Can you, then, tell me the
 name of any woman whose initials are
4671𓀴      L. L.?”
4672𓀴
4673𓀴      He thought
 for a few minutes.
4674𓀴
4675𓀴      “No,” said he. “There are a
 few gipsies and labouring folk for
4676𓀴      whom I can’t
 answer, but among
 the farmers or gentry there is no
4677𓀴      one whose
 initials are those.
 Wait a bit though,” he added after
4678𓀴      a pause. “There
 is Laura Lyons—her
 initials are L. L.—but she
4679𓀴      lives in Coombe Tracey.”
4680𓀴
4681𓀴      “Who is she?” I asked.
4682𓀴
4683𓀴      “She is Frankland’s
 daughter.”
4684𓀴
4685𓀴      “What! Old Frankland
 the crank?”
4686𓀴
4687𓀴      “Exactly. She
 married an artist
 named Lyons, who came sketching
4688𓀴      on the moor.
 He proved to be
 a blackguard and deserted her. The
4689𓀴      fault from what I hear may
 not have been entirely on one side.
4690𓀴      Her father refused to have
 anything to do with her because she
4691𓀴      had married
 without his consent
 and perhaps for one or two other
4692𓀴      reasons as
 well. So, between
 the old sinner and the young one the
4693𓀴      girl has had
 a pretty bad time.”
4694𓀴
4695𓀴      “How does she live?”
4696𓀴
4697𓀴      “I fancy old
 Frankland allows
 her a pittance, but it cannot be
4698𓀴      more, for
 his own affairs are
 considerably involved. Whatever she
4699𓀴      may have deserved one could
 not allow her to go hopelessly to the
4700𓀴      bad. Her story got about,
 and several of the people here did
4701𓀴      something to enable her to
 earn an honest living. Stapleton did
4702𓀴      for one, and
 Sir Charles for
 another. I gave a trifle myself. It
4703𓀴      was to set her up
 in a typewriting business.”
4704𓀴
4705𓀴      He wanted
 to know the object
 of my inquiries, but I managed to
4706𓀴      satisfy his
 curiosity without
 telling him too much, for there is
4707𓀴      no reason
 why we should take
 anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow
4708𓀴      morning I shall find my way
 to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see
4709𓀴      this Mrs. Laura
 Lyons, of equivocal
 reputation, a long step will
4710𓀴      have been made
 towards clearing
 one incident in this chain of
4711𓀴      mysteries. I am
 certainly developing
 the wisdom of the serpent,
4712𓀴      for when Mortimer
 pressed his
 questions to an inconvenient extent
4713𓀴      I asked him
 casually to what
 type Frankland’s skull belonged, and
4714𓀴      so heard nothing
 but craniology
 for the rest of our drive. I have
4715𓀴      not lived for years with
 Sherlock Holmes for nothing.
4716𓀴
4717𓀴      I have only
 one other incident
 to record upon this tempestuous
4718𓀴      and melancholy
 day. This was
 my conversation with Barrymore just
4719𓀴      now, which
 gives me one more
 strong card which I can play in due
4720𓀴      time.
4721𓀴
4722𓀴      Mortimer had
 stayed to dinner,
 and he and the baronet played
4723𓀴      écarté afterwards.
 The butler
 brought me my coffee into the
4724𓀴      library, and
 I took the chance
 to ask him a few questions.
4725𓀴
4726𓀴      “Well,” said
 I, “has this precious
 relation of yours departed, or
4727𓀴      is he still
 lurking out yonder?”
4728𓀴
4729𓀴      “I don’t know,
 sir. I hope to
 heaven that he has gone, for he has
4730𓀴      brought nothing but trouble
 here! I’ve not heard of him since I
4731𓀴      left out food for him last,
 and that was three days ago.”
4732𓀴
4733𓀴      “Did you see him then?”
4734𓀴
4735𓀴      “No, sir, but the food was
 gone when next I went that way.”
4736𓀴
4737𓀴      “Then he was
 certainly there?”
4738𓀴
4739𓀴      “So you would
 think, sir, unless
 it was the other man who took
4740𓀴      it.”
4741𓀴
4742𓀴      I sat with my coffee-cup
 halfway to my lips and stared at
4743𓀴      Barrymore.
4744𓀴
4745𓀴      “You know that there
 is another man then?”
4746𓀴
4747𓀴      “Yes, sir; there is
 another man upon the moor.”
4748𓀴
4749𓀴      “Have you seen him?”
4750𓀴
4751𓀴      “No, sir.”
4752𓀴
4753𓀴      “How do you
 know of him then?”
4754𓀴
4755𓀴      “Selden told
 me of him, sir,
 a week ago or more. He’s in hiding,
4756𓀴      too, but he’s not a convict
 as far as I can make out. I don’t
4757𓀴      like it, Dr. Watson—I tell
 you straight, sir, that I don’t like
4758𓀴      it.” He spoke with a
 sudden passion of earnestness.
4759𓀴
4760𓀴      “Now, listen
 to me, Barrymore!
 I have no interest in this matter
4761𓀴      but that of your master. I
 have come here with no object except
4762𓀴      to help him.
 Tell me, frankly,
 what it is that you don’t like.”
4763𓀴
4764𓀴      Barrymore hesitated
 for a moment,
 as if he regretted his outburst
4765𓀴      or found it difficult to
 express his own feelings in words.
4766𓀴
4767𓀴      “It’s all these goings-on,
 sir,” he cried at last, waving his
4768𓀴      hand towards
 the rain-lashed
 window which faced the moor.
4769𓀴      “There’s foul
 play somewhere,
 and there’s black villainy brewing,
4770𓀴      to that I’ll
 swear! Very glad
 I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry
4771𓀴      on his way back
 to London again!”
4772𓀴
4773𓀴      “But what is
 it that alarms you?”
4774𓀴
4775𓀴      “Look at Sir
 Charles’s death!
 That was bad enough, for all that
4776𓀴      the coroner said. Look at
 the noises on the moor at night.
4777𓀴      There’s not
 a man would cross
 it after sundown if he was paid for
4778𓀴      it. Look at this stranger
 hiding out yonder, and watching and
4779𓀴      waiting! What’s he waiting
 for? What does it mean? It means no
4780𓀴      good to anyone
 of the name of
 Baskerville, and very glad I shall
4781𓀴      be to be quit
 of it all on the
 day that Sir Henry’s new servants
4782𓀴      are ready to
 take over the Hall.”
4783𓀴
4784𓀴      “But about this stranger,”
 said I. “Can you tell me anything
4785𓀴      about him?
 What did Selden say?
 Did he find out where he hid, or
4786𓀴      what he was doing?”
4787𓀴
4788𓀴      “He saw him
 once or twice, but
 he is a deep one and gives nothing
4789𓀴      away. At first he thought
 that he was the police, but soon he
4790𓀴      found that he had some lay
 of his own. A kind of gentleman he
4791𓀴      was, as far
 as he could see,
 but what he was doing he could not
4792𓀴      make out.”
4793𓀴
4794𓀴      “And where did
 he say that he lived?”
4795𓀴
4796𓀴      “Among the
 old houses on the
 hillside—the stone huts where the
4797𓀴      old folk used to live.”
4798𓀴
4799𓀴      “But how about his food?”
4800𓀴
4801𓀴      “Selden found out that he
 has got a lad who works for him and
4802𓀴      brings all he needs. I dare
 say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what
4803𓀴      he wants.”
4804𓀴
4805𓀴      “Very good, Barrymore. We
 may talk further of this some other
4806𓀴      time.” When the butler had
 gone I walked over to the black
4807𓀴      window, and
 I looked through
 a blurred pane at the driving clouds
4808𓀴      and at the
 tossing outline of
 the wind-swept trees. It is a wild
4809𓀴      night indoors,
 and what must
 it be in a stone hut upon the moor.
4810𓀴      What passion of hatred can
 it be which leads a man to lurk in
4811𓀴      such a place
 at such a time!
 And what deep and earnest purpose
4812𓀴      can he have which calls for
 such a trial! There, in that hut upon
4813𓀴      the moor, seems
 to lie the very
 centre of that problem which has
4814𓀴      vexed me so sorely. I swear
 that another day shall not have
4815𓀴      passed before
 I have done all
 that man can do to reach the heart
4816𓀴      of the mystery.

4821𓀴Chapter 11.
4822𓀴The Man on the Tor
4823𓀴
4824𓀴
4825𓀴      The extract from my private
 diary which forms the last chapter
4826𓀴      has brought my narrative up
 to the eighteenth of October, a time
4827𓀴      when these strange events
 began to move swiftly towards their
4828𓀴      terrible conclusion. The
 incidents of the next few days are
4829𓀴      indelibly graven upon my
 recollection, and I can tell them
4830𓀴      without reference
 to the notes
 made at the time. I start them
4831𓀴      from the day
 which succeeded
 that upon which I had established
4832𓀴      two facts of
 great importance,
 the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of
4833𓀴      Coombe Tracey
 had written to
 Sir Charles Baskerville and made an
4834𓀴      appointment with him at the
 very place and hour that he met his
4835𓀴      death, the other that the
 lurking man upon the moor was to be
4836𓀴      found among the stone huts
 upon the hillside. With these two
4837𓀴      facts in my
 possession I felt
 that either my intelligence or my
4838𓀴      courage must
 be deficient if
 I could not throw some further light
4839𓀴      upon these dark places.
4840𓀴
4841𓀴      I had no opportunity
 to tell
 the baronet what I had learned about
4842𓀴      Mrs. Lyons upon the evening
 before, for Dr. Mortimer remained
4843𓀴      with him at
 cards until it was
 very late. At breakfast, however,
4844𓀴      I informed him
 about my discovery
 and asked him whether he would
4845𓀴      care to accompany
 me to Coombe
 Tracey. At first he was very eager
4846𓀴      to come, but
 on second thoughts
 it seemed to both of us that if I
4847𓀴      went alone
 the results might
 be better. The more formal we made
4848𓀴      the visit the
 less information
 we might obtain. I left Sir Henry
4849𓀴      behind, therefore,
 not without
 some prickings of conscience, and
4850𓀴      drove off
 upon my new quest.
4851𓀴
4852𓀴      When I reached
 Coombe Tracey
 I told Perkins to put up the horses,
4853𓀴      and I made
 inquiries for the
 lady whom I had come to interrogate.
4854𓀴      I had no difficulty
 in finding
 her rooms, which were central and
4855𓀴      well appointed.
 A maid showed
 me in without ceremony, and as I
4856𓀴      entered the sitting-room
 a lady, who was sitting before a
4857𓀴      Remington
 typewriter, sprang
 up with a pleasant smile of welcome.
4858𓀴      Her face fell,
 however, when
 she saw that I was a stranger, and
4859𓀴      she sat down again and
 asked me the object of my visit.
4860𓀴
4861𓀴      The first impression left
 by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme
4862𓀴      beauty. Her
 eyes and hair were
 of the same rich hazel colour, and
4863𓀴      her cheeks,
 though considerably
 freckled, were flushed with the
4864𓀴      exquisite bloom
 of the brunette,
 the dainty pink which lurks at
4865𓀴      the heart of
 the sulphur rose.
 Admiration was, I repeat, the
4866𓀴      first impression. But the
 second was criticism. There was
4867𓀴      something subtly wrong with
 the face, some coarseness of
4868𓀴      expression, some
 hardness, perhaps,
 of eye, some looseness of lip
4869𓀴      which marred its perfect
 beauty. But these, of course, are
4870𓀴      afterthoughts.
 At the moment
 I was simply conscious that I was in
4871𓀴      the presence
 of a very handsome
 woman, and that she was asking me
4872𓀴      the reasons for my visit. I
 had not quite understood until that
4873𓀴      instant how delicate
 my mission was.
4874𓀴
4875𓀴      “I have the pleasure,” said
 I, “of knowing your father.”
4876𓀴
4877𓀴      It was a clumsy
 introduction,
 and the lady made me feel it.
4878𓀴      “There is nothing in common
 between my father and me,” she said.
4879𓀴      “I owe him nothing, and his
 friends are not mine. If it were not
4880𓀴      for the late Sir
 Charles Baskerville
 and some other kind hearts I
4881𓀴      might have starved for
 all that my father cared.”
4882𓀴
4883𓀴      “It was about the late Sir
 Charles Baskerville that I have come
4884𓀴      here to see you.”
4885𓀴
4886𓀴      The freckles started
 out on the lady’s face.
4887𓀴
4888𓀴      “What can I tell you about
 him?” she asked, and her fingers
4889𓀴      played nervously over
 the stops of her typewriter.
4890𓀴
4891𓀴      “You knew
 him, did you not?”
4892𓀴
4893𓀴      “I have already said that I
 owe a great deal to his kindness. If
4894𓀴      I am able to support myself
 it is largely due to the interest
4895𓀴      which he took in
 my unhappy situation.”
4896𓀴
4897𓀴      “Did you correspond
 with him?”
4898𓀴
4899𓀴      The lady looked
 quickly up with
 an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.
4900𓀴
4901𓀴      “What is the
 object of these
 questions?” she asked sharply.
4902𓀴
4903𓀴      “The object is to avoid a
 public scandal. It is better that I
4904𓀴      should ask
 them here than that
 the matter should pass outside our
4905𓀴      control.”
4906𓀴
4907𓀴      She was silent and her face
 was still very pale. At last she
4908𓀴      looked up with
 something reckless
 and defiant in her manner.
4909𓀴
4910𓀴      “Well, I’ll answer,” she
 said. “What are your questions?”
4911𓀴
4912𓀴      “Did you correspond
 with Sir Charles?”
4913𓀴
4914𓀴      “I certainly wrote to him
 once or twice to acknowledge his
4915𓀴      delicacy and
 his generosity.”
4916𓀴
4917𓀴      “Have you the dates
 of those letters?”
4918𓀴
4919𓀴      “No.”
4920𓀴
4921𓀴      “Have you ever met him?”
4922𓀴
4923𓀴      “Yes, once
 or twice, when he
 came into Coombe Tracey. He was a
4924𓀴      very retiring man, and he
 preferred to do good by stealth.”
4925𓀴
4926𓀴      “But if you
 saw him so seldom
 and wrote so seldom, how did he
4927𓀴      know enough
 about your affairs
 to be able to help you, as you say
4928𓀴      that he has done?”
4929𓀴
4930𓀴      She met my difficulty
 with the utmost readiness.
4931𓀴
4932𓀴      “There were
 several gentlemen
 who knew my sad history and united
4933𓀴      to help me. One
 was Mr. Stapleton,
 a neighbour and intimate
4934𓀴      friend of Sir Charles’s. He
 was exceedingly kind, and it was
4935𓀴      through him
 that Sir Charles
 learned about my affairs.”
4936𓀴
4937𓀴      I knew already
 that Sir Charles
 Baskerville had made Stapleton
4938𓀴      his almoner upon
 several occasions,
 so the lady’s statement bore
4939𓀴      the impress
 of truth upon it.
4940𓀴
4941𓀴      “Did you ever write to Sir
 Charles asking him to meet you?” I
4942𓀴      continued.
4943𓀴
4944𓀴      Mrs. Lyons
 flushed with anger
 again. “Really, sir, this is a very
4945𓀴      extraordinary question.”
4946𓀴
4947𓀴      “I am sorry, madam,
 but I must repeat it.”
4948𓀴
4949𓀴      “Then I answer,
 certainly not.”
4950𓀴
4951𓀴      “Not on the very day
 of Sir Charles’s death?”
4952𓀴
4953𓀴      The flush had
 faded in an instant,
 and a deathly face was before
4954𓀴      me. Her dry
 lips could not speak
 the “No” which I saw rather than
4955𓀴      heard.
4956𓀴
4957𓀴      “Surely your
 memory deceives
 you,” said I. “I could even quote a
4958𓀴      passage of your letter. It
 ran ‘Please, please, as you are a
4959𓀴      gentleman,
 burn this letter,
 and be at the gate by ten o’clock.’”
4960𓀴
4961𓀴      I thought that
 she had fainted,
 but she recovered herself by a
4962𓀴      supreme effort.
4963𓀴
4964𓀴      “Is there no such thing
 as a gentleman?” she gasped.
4965𓀴
4966𓀴      “You do Sir
 Charles an injustice.
 He _did_ burn the letter. But
4967𓀴      sometimes a letter may
 be legible even when burned. You
4968𓀴      acknowledge now
 that you wrote it?”
4969𓀴
4970𓀴      “Yes, I did write it,” she
 cried, pouring out her soul in a
4971𓀴      torrent of
 words. “I did write
 it. Why should I deny it? I have
4972𓀴      no reason to be ashamed
 of it. I wished him to help me. I
4973𓀴      believed that
 if I had an interview
 I could gain his help, so I
4974𓀴      asked him to meet me.”
4975𓀴
4976𓀴      “But why at such an hour?”
4977𓀴
4978𓀴      “Because I had
 only just learned
 that he was going to London next
4979𓀴      day and might
 be away for months.
 There were reasons why I could
4980𓀴      not get there earlier.”
4981𓀴
4982𓀴      “But why a
 rendezvous in the
 garden instead of a visit to the
4983𓀴      house?”
4984𓀴
4985𓀴      “Do you think a woman could
 go alone at that hour to a bachelor’s
4986𓀴      house?”
4987𓀴
4988𓀴      “Well, what happened
 when you did get there?”
4989𓀴
4990𓀴      “I never went.”
4991𓀴
4992𓀴      “Mrs. Lyons!”
4993𓀴
4994𓀴      “No, I swear it to you on
 all I hold sacred. I never went.
4995𓀴      Something intervened
 to prevent my going.”
4996𓀴
4997𓀴      “What was that?”
4998𓀴
4999𓀴      “That is a private
 matter. I cannot tell it.”
5000𓀴
5001𓀴      “You acknowledge then that
 you made an appointment with Sir
5002𓀴      Charles at
 the very hour and
 place at which he met his death, but
5003𓀴      you deny that you
 kept the appointment.”
5004𓀴
5005𓀴      “That is the truth.”
5006𓀴
5007𓀴      Again and again
 I cross-questioned
 her, but I could never get
5008𓀴      past that point.
5009𓀴
5010𓀴      “Mrs. Lyons,”
 said I as I rose
 from this long and inconclusive
5011𓀴      interview, “you are taking
 a very great responsibility and
5012𓀴      putting yourself in a very
 false position by not making an
5013𓀴      absolutely clean breast of
 all that you know. If I have to call
5014𓀴      in the aid
 of the police you
 will find how seriously you are
5015𓀴      compromised.
 If your position
 is innocent, why did you in the
5016𓀴      first instance deny having
 written to Sir Charles upon that
5017𓀴      date?”
5018𓀴
5019𓀴      “Because I feared that some
 false conclusion might be drawn from
5020𓀴      it and that I might find
 myself involved in a scandal.”
5021𓀴
5022𓀴      “And why were
 you so pressing
 that Sir Charles should destroy
5023𓀴      your letter?”
5024𓀴
5025𓀴      “If you have read
 the letter you will know.”
5026𓀴
5027𓀴      “I did not say that
 I had read all the letter.”
5028𓀴
5029𓀴      “You quoted some of it.”
5030𓀴
5031𓀴      “I quoted
 the postscript. The
 letter had, as I said, been burned
5032𓀴      and it was not all legible.
 I ask you once again why it was that
5033𓀴      you were so
 pressing that Sir
 Charles should destroy this letter
5034𓀴      which he received
 on the day of his death.”
5035𓀴
5036𓀴      “The matter is
 a very private one.”
5037𓀴
5038𓀴      “The more reason
 why you should
 avoid a public investigation.”
5039𓀴
5040𓀴      “I will tell
 you, then. If you
 have heard anything of my unhappy
5041𓀴      history you
 will know that I
 made a rash marriage and had reason
5042𓀴      to regret it.”
5043𓀴
5044𓀴      “I have heard so much.”
5045𓀴
5046𓀴      “My life has
 been one incessant
 persecution from a husband whom I
5047𓀴      abhor. The law
 is upon his side,
 and every day I am faced by the
5048𓀴      possibility
 that he may force
 me to live with him. At the time
5049𓀴      that I wrote this letter to
 Sir Charles I had learned that there
5050𓀴      was a prospect
 of my regaining
 my freedom if certain expenses
5051𓀴      could be met.
 It meant everything
 to me—peace of mind, happiness,
5052𓀴      self-respect—everything. I
 knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I
5053𓀴      thought that
 if he heard the
 story from my own lips he would help
5054𓀴      me.”
5055𓀴
5056𓀴      “Then how is it
 that you did not go?”
5057𓀴
5058𓀴      “Because I received help in
 the interval from another source.”
5059𓀴
5060𓀴      “Why then,
 did you not write
 to Sir Charles and explain this?”
5061𓀴
5062𓀴      “So I should
 have done had I
 not seen his death in the paper next
5063𓀴      morning.”
5064𓀴
5065𓀴      The woman’s
 story hung coherently
 together, and all my questions
5066𓀴      were unable
 to shake it. I could
 only check it by finding if she
5067𓀴      had, indeed,
 instituted divorce
 proceedings against her husband
5068𓀴      at or about the
 time of the tragedy.
5069𓀴
5070𓀴      It was unlikely
 that she would
 dare to say that she had not been
5071𓀴      to Baskerville Hall if she
 really had been, for a trap would be
5072𓀴      necessary
 to take her there,
 and could not have returned to
5073𓀴      Coombe Tracey
 until the early
 hours of the morning. Such an
5074𓀴      excursion could not be kept
 secret. The probability was,
5075𓀴      therefore,
 that she was telling
 the truth, or, at least, a part
5076𓀴      of the truth.
 I came away baffled
 and disheartened. Once again I
5077𓀴      had reached
 that dead wall which
 seemed to be built across every
5078𓀴      path by which
 I tried to get
 at the object of my mission. And yet
5079𓀴      the more I thought
 of the lady’s
 face and of her manner the more
5080𓀴      I felt that
 something was being
 held back from me. Why should she
5081𓀴      turn so pale?
 Why should she
 fight against every admission until
5082𓀴      it was forced from her? Why
 should she have been so reticent at
5083𓀴      the time of
 the tragedy? Surely
 the explanation of all this could
5084𓀴      not be as innocent
 as she would
 have me believe. For the moment I
5085𓀴      could proceed no farther in
 that direction, but must turn back to
5086𓀴      that other
 clue which was to
 be sought for among the stone huts
5087𓀴      upon the moor.
5088𓀴
5089𓀴      And that was a most vague
 direction. I realised it as I drove
5090𓀴      back and noted
 how hill after
 hill showed traces of the ancient
5091𓀴      people. Barrymore’s
 only indication
 had been that the stranger
5092𓀴      lived in one
 of these abandoned
 huts, and many hundreds of them
5093𓀴      are scattered
 throughout the
 length and breadth of the moor. But
5094𓀴      I had my own experience for
 a guide since it had shown me the man
5095𓀴      himself standing
 upon the summit
 of the Black Tor. That, then,
5096𓀴      should be the centre of my
 search. From there I should explore
5097𓀴      every hut
 upon the moor until
 I lighted upon the right one. If
5098𓀴      this man were
 inside it I should
 find out from his own lips, at
5099𓀴      the point of my revolver if
 necessary, who he was and why he had
5100𓀴      dogged us so long. He might
 slip away from us in the crowd of
5101𓀴      Regent Street, but it would
 puzzle him to do so upon the lonely
5102𓀴      moor. On the other hand, if
 I should find the hut and its tenant
5103𓀴      should not be within it I
 must remain there, however long the
5104𓀴      vigil, until he returned.
 Holmes had missed him in London. It
5105𓀴      would indeed be a triumph
 for me if I could run him to earth
5106𓀴      where my master had failed.
5107𓀴
5108𓀴      Luck had been
 against us again
 and again in this inquiry, but now
5109𓀴      at last it
 came to my aid. And
 the messenger of good fortune was
5110𓀴      none other
 than Mr. Frankland,
 who was standing, grey-whiskered
5111𓀴      and red-faced,
 outside the gate
 of his garden, which opened on to
5112𓀴      the highroad along
 which I travelled.
5113𓀴
5114𓀴      “Good-day,
 Dr. Watson,” cried
 he with unwonted good humour, “you
5115𓀴      must really
 give your horses
 a rest and come in to have a glass
5116𓀴      of wine and
 to congratulate me.”
5117𓀴
5118𓀴      My feelings
 towards him were
 very far from being friendly after
5119𓀴      what I had heard
 of his treatment
 of his daughter, but I was
5120𓀴      anxious to send Perkins
 and the wagonette home, and the
5121𓀴      opportunity was a good one.
 I alighted and sent a message to Sir
5122𓀴      Henry that
 I should walk over
 in time for dinner. Then I followed
5123𓀴      Frankland into
 his dining-room.
5124𓀴
5125𓀴      “It is a great day for me,
 sir—one of the red-letter days of my
5126𓀴      life,” he cried
 with many chuckles.
 “I have brought off a double
5127𓀴      event. I mean to teach them
 in these parts that law is law, and
5128𓀴      that there
 is a man here who
 does not fear to invoke it. I have
5129𓀴      established a
 right of way through
 the centre of old Middleton’s
5130𓀴      park, slap across it, sir,
 within a hundred yards of his own
5131𓀴      front door.
 What do you think
 of that? We’ll teach these magnates
5132𓀴      that they cannot
 ride roughshod
 over the rights of the commoners,
5133𓀴      confound them!
 And I’ve closed
 the wood where the Fernworthy folk
5134𓀴      used to picnic.
 These infernal
 people seem to think that there
5135𓀴      are no rights of property,
 and that they can swarm where they
5136𓀴      like with their
 papers and their
 bottles. Both cases decided, Dr.
5137𓀴      Watson, and
 both in my favour.
 I haven’t had such a day since I
5138𓀴      had Sir John
 Morland for trespass
 because he shot in his own
5139𓀴      warren.”
5140𓀴
5141𓀴      “How on earth
 did you do that?”
5142𓀴
5143𓀴      “Look it up
 in the books, sir.
 It will repay reading—Frankland
5144𓀴      _v_. Morland,
 Court of Queen’s
 Bench. It cost me £200, but I got
5145𓀴      my verdict.”
5146𓀴
5147𓀴      “Did it do you any good?”
5148𓀴
5149𓀴      “None, sir,
 none. I am proud
 to say that I had no interest in the
5150𓀴      matter. I act entirely from
 a sense of public duty. I have no
5151𓀴      doubt, for
 example, that the
 Fernworthy people will burn me in
5152𓀴      effigy tonight.
 I told the police
 last time they did it that they
5153𓀴      should stop
 these disgraceful
 exhibitions. The County
5154𓀴      Constabulary
 is in a scandalous
 state, sir, and it has not
5155𓀴      afforded me the protection
 to which I am entitled. The case of
5156𓀴      Frankland _v_.
 Regina will bring
 the matter before the attention
5157𓀴      of the public. I told them
 that they would have occasion to
5158𓀴      regret their treatment of
 me, and already my words have come
5159𓀴      true.”
5160𓀴
5161𓀴      “How so?” I asked.
5162𓀴
5163𓀴      The old man
 put on a very knowing
 expression. “Because I could
5164𓀴      tell them
 what they are dying
 to know; but nothing would induce
5165𓀴      me to help the
 rascals in any way.”
5166𓀴
5167𓀴      I had been
 casting round for
 some excuse by which I could get
5168𓀴      away from
 his gossip, but now
 I began to wish to hear more of it.
5169𓀴      I had seen enough
 of the contrary
 nature of the old sinner to
5170𓀴      understand that any strong
 sign of interest would be the surest
5171𓀴      way to stop
 his confidences.
5172𓀴
5173𓀴      “Some poaching
 case, no doubt?”
 said I with an indifferent
5174𓀴      manner.
5175𓀴
5176𓀴      “Ha, ha, my
 boy, a very much
 more important matter than that!
5177𓀴      What about the
 convict on the moor?”
5178𓀴
5179𓀴      I stared. “You don’t mean
 that you know where he is?” said I.
5180𓀴
5181𓀴      “I may not
 know exactly where
 he is, but I am quite sure that I
5182𓀴      could help
 the police to lay
 their hands on him. Has it never
5183𓀴      struck you that the way to
 catch that man was to find out where
5184𓀴      he got his food
 and so trace it to him?”
5185𓀴
5186𓀴      He certainly
 seemed to be getting
 uncomfortably near the truth.
5187𓀴      “No doubt,”
 said I; “but how
 do you know that he is anywhere upon
5188𓀴      the moor?”
5189𓀴
5190𓀴      “I know it
 because I have seen
 with my own eyes the messenger who
5191𓀴      takes him his food.”
5192𓀴
5193𓀴      My heart sank
 for Barrymore.
 It was a serious thing to be in the
5194𓀴      power of this spiteful old
 busybody. But his next remark took a
5195𓀴      weight from my mind.
5196𓀴
5197𓀴      “You’ll be
 surprised to hear
 that his food is taken to him by a
5198𓀴      child. I see
 him every day through
 my telescope upon the roof. He
5199𓀴      passes along the same path
 at the same hour, and to whom should
5200𓀴      he be going except
 to the convict?”
5201𓀴
5202𓀴      Here was luck indeed! And
 yet I suppressed all appearance of
5203𓀴      interest.
 A child! Barrymore
 had said that our unknown was
5204𓀴      supplied by a boy. It was
 on his track, and not upon the
5205𓀴      convict’s, that Frankland
 had stumbled. If I could get his
5206𓀴      knowledge
 it might save me a
 long and weary hunt. But incredulity
5207𓀴      and indifference were
 evidently my strongest cards.
5208𓀴
5209𓀴      “I should say
 that it was much
 more likely that it was the son of
5210𓀴      one of the
 moorland shepherds
 taking out his father’s dinner.”
5211𓀴
5212𓀴      The least appearance
 of opposition
 struck fire out of the old
5213𓀴      autocrat. His eyes looked
 malignantly at me, and his grey
5214𓀴      whiskers bristled
 like those of an angry cat.
5215𓀴
5216𓀴      “Indeed, sir!”
 said he, pointing
 out over the wide-stretching
5217𓀴      moor. “Do
 you see that Black
 Tor over yonder? Well, do you see
5218𓀴      the low hill beyond with
 the thornbush upon it? It is the
5219𓀴      stoniest part
 of the whole moor.
 Is that a place where a shepherd
5220𓀴      would be likely to take his
 station? Your suggestion, sir, is a
5221𓀴      most absurd one.”
5222𓀴
5223𓀴      I meekly answered that I
 had spoken without knowing all the
5224𓀴      facts. My
 submission pleased
 him and led him to further
5225𓀴      confidences.
5226𓀴
5227𓀴      “You may be sure, sir, that
 I have very good grounds before I
5228𓀴      come to an
 opinion. I have seen
 the boy again and again with his
5229𓀴      bundle. Every
 day, and sometimes
 twice a day, I have been
5230𓀴      able—but wait a moment, Dr.
 Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is
5231𓀴      there at the present moment
 something moving upon that hillside?”
5232𓀴
5233𓀴      It was several
 miles off, but
 I could distinctly see a small dark
5234𓀴      dot against the
 dull green and grey.
5235𓀴
5236𓀴      “Come, sir, come!”
 cried Frankland,
 rushing upstairs. “You will
5237𓀴      see with your own eyes
 and judge for yourself.”
5238𓀴
5239𓀴      The telescope, a formidable
 instrument mounted upon a tripod,
5240𓀴      stood upon
 the flat leads of
 the house. Frankland clapped his eye
5241𓀴      to it and gave
 a cry of satisfaction.
5242𓀴
5243𓀴      “Quick, Dr. Watson, quick,
 before he passes over the hill!”
5244𓀴
5245𓀴      There he was, sure enough,
 a small urchin with a little bundle
5246𓀴      upon his shoulder, toiling
 slowly up the hill. When he reached
5247𓀴      the crest I saw
 the ragged uncouth
 figure outlined for an instant
5248𓀴      against the
 cold blue sky. He
 looked round him with a furtive and
5249𓀴      stealthy air,
 as one who dreads
 pursuit. Then he vanished over
5250𓀴      the hill.
5251𓀴
5252𓀴      “Well! Am I right?”
5253𓀴
5254𓀴      “Certainly,
 there is a boy who
 seems to have some secret errand.”
5255𓀴
5256𓀴      “And what
 the errand is even
 a county constable could guess. But
5257𓀴      not one word
 shall they have
 from me, and I bind you to secrecy
5258𓀴      also, Dr. Watson. Not
 a word! You understand!”
5259𓀴
5260𓀴      “Just as you wish.”
5261𓀴
5262𓀴      “They have treated
 me shamefully—shamefully.
 When the facts come
5263𓀴      out in Frankland
 _v_. Regina
 I venture to think that a thrill of
5264𓀴      indignation
 will run through
 the country. Nothing would induce me
5265𓀴      to help the
 police in any way.
 For all they cared it might have
5266𓀴      been me, instead
 of my effigy,
 which these rascals burned at the
5267𓀴      stake. Surely
 you are not going!
 You will help me to empty the
5268𓀴      decanter in honour
 of this great occasion!”
5269𓀴
5270𓀴      But I resisted
 all his solicitations
 and succeeded in dissuading
5271𓀴      him from his
 announced intention
 of walking home with me. I kept
5272𓀴      the road as long as his eye
 was on me, and then I struck off
5273𓀴      across the
 moor and made for
 the stony hill over which the boy
5274𓀴      had disappeared. Everything
 was working in my favour, and I swore
5275𓀴      that it should
 not be through
 lack of energy or perseverance that
5276𓀴      I should miss
 the chance which
 fortune had thrown in my way.
5277𓀴
5278𓀴      The sun was already sinking
 when I reached the summit of the
5279𓀴      hill, and the
 long slopes beneath
 me were all golden-green on one
5280𓀴      side and grey shadow on the
 other. A haze lay low upon the
5281𓀴      farthest sky-line,
 out of which
 jutted the fantastic shapes of
5282𓀴      Belliver and
 Vixen Tor. Over
 the wide expanse there was no sound
5283𓀴      and no movement. One great
 grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared
5284𓀴      aloft in the
 blue heaven. He
 and I seemed to be the only living
5285𓀴      things between
 the huge arch
 of the sky and the desert beneath
5286𓀴      it. The barren
 scene, the sense
 of loneliness, and the mystery
5287𓀴      and urgency
 of my task all struck
 a chill into my heart. The boy
5288𓀴      was nowhere to be seen. But
 down beneath me in a cleft of the
5289𓀴      hills there was a circle of
 the old stone huts, and in the middle
5290𓀴      of them there was one which
 retained sufficient roof to act as a
5291𓀴      screen against the weather.
 My heart leaped within me as I saw
5292𓀴      it. This must be the burrow
 where the stranger lurked. At last my
5293𓀴      foot was on the threshold
 of his hiding place—his secret was
5294𓀴      within my grasp.
5295𓀴
5296𓀴      As I approached
 the hut, walking
 as warily as Stapleton would do
5297𓀴      when with
 poised net he drew
 near the settled butterfly, I
5298𓀴      satisfied myself that the
 place had indeed been used as a
5299𓀴      habitation. A vague pathway
 among the boulders led to the
5300𓀴      dilapidated opening which
 served as a door. All was silent
5301𓀴      within. The unknown might
 be lurking there, or he might be
5302𓀴      prowling on the moor. My
 nerves tingled with the sense of
5303𓀴      adventure.
 Throwing aside my
 cigarette, I closed my hand upon the
5304𓀴      butt of my revolver
 and, walking
 swiftly up to the door, I looked
5305𓀴      in. The place was empty.
5306𓀴
5307𓀴      But there were ample signs
 that I had not come upon a false
5308𓀴      scent. This was certainly
 where the man lived. Some blankets
5309𓀴      rolled in a waterproof lay
 upon that very stone slab upon which
5310𓀴      Neolithic man
 had once slumbered.
 The ashes of a fire were heaped
5311𓀴      in a rude grate.
 Beside it lay
 some cooking utensils and a bucket
5312𓀴      half-full
 of water. A litter
 of empty tins showed that the place
5313𓀴      had been occupied for some
 time, and I saw, as my eyes became
5314𓀴      accustomed to the checkered
 light, a pannikin and a half-full
5315𓀴      bottle of spirits standing
 in the corner. In the middle of the
5316𓀴      hut a flat stone served the
 purpose of a table, and upon this
5317𓀴      stood a small
 cloth bundle—the
 same, no doubt, which I had seen
5318𓀴      through the
 telescope upon the
 shoulder of the boy. It contained
5319𓀴      a loaf of bread, a tinned
 tongue, and two tins of preserved
5320𓀴      peaches. As I set it down
 again, after having examined it, my
5321𓀴      heart leaped
 to see that beneath
 it there lay a sheet of paper
5322𓀴      with writing
 upon it. I raised
 it, and this was what I read,
5323𓀴      roughly scrawled in pencil:
 “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe
5324𓀴      Tracey.”
5325𓀴
5326𓀴      For a minute I stood there
 with the paper in my hands thinking
5327𓀴      out the meaning
 of this curt
 message. It was I, then, and not Sir
5328𓀴      Henry, who was being dogged
 by this secret man. He had not
5329𓀴      followed me himself, but
 he had set an agent—the boy,
5330𓀴      perhaps—upon my track, and
 this was his report. Possibly I had
5331𓀴      taken no step
 since I had been
 upon the moor which had not been
5332𓀴      observed and
 reported. Always
 there was this feeling of an unseen
5333𓀴      force, a fine net drawn
 round us with infinite skill and
5334𓀴      delicacy, holding
 us so lightly
 that it was only at some supreme
5335𓀴      moment that
 one realised that
 one was indeed entangled in its
5336𓀴      meshes.
5337𓀴
5338𓀴      If there was
 one report there
 might be others, so I looked round
5339𓀴      the hut in search of them.
 There was no trace, however, of
5340𓀴      anything of
 the kind, nor could
 I discover any sign which might
5341𓀴      indicate the character
 or intentions
 of the man who lived in this
5342𓀴      singular place,
 save that he
 must be of Spartan habits and cared
5343𓀴      little for the comforts of
 life. When I thought of the heavy
5344𓀴      rains and looked
 at the gaping
 roof I understood how strong and
5345𓀴      immutable
 must be the purpose
 which had kept him in that
5346𓀴      inhospitable abode. Was he
 our malignant enemy, or was he by
5347𓀴      chance our
 guardian angel? I
 swore that I would not leave the hut
5348𓀴      until I knew.
5349𓀴
5350𓀴      Outside the sun was sinking
 low and the west was blazing with
5351𓀴      scarlet and
 gold. Its reflection
 was shot back in ruddy patches
5352𓀴      by the distant
 pools which lay
 amid the great Grimpen Mire. There
5353𓀴      were the two
 towers of Baskerville
 Hall, and there a distant blur
5354𓀴      of smoke which
 marked the village
 of Grimpen. Between the two,
5355𓀴      behind the
 hill, was the house
 of the Stapletons. All was sweet
5356𓀴      and mellow
 and peaceful in the
 golden evening light, and yet as I
5357𓀴      looked at
 them my soul shared
 none of the peace of Nature but
5358𓀴      quivered at
 the vagueness and
 the terror of that interview which
5359𓀴      every instant was bringing
 nearer. With tingling nerves but a
5360𓀴      fixed purpose, I sat in the
 dark recess of the hut and waited
5361𓀴      with sombre patience
 for the coming of its tenant.
5362𓀴
5363𓀴      And then at
 last I heard him.
 Far away came the sharp clink of a
5364𓀴      boot striking upon a stone.
 Then another and yet another, coming
5365𓀴      nearer and nearer. I shrank
 back into the darkest corner and
5366𓀴      cocked the
 pistol in my pocket,
 determined not to discover myself
5367𓀴      until I had an opportunity
 of seeing something of the stranger.
5368𓀴      There was
 a long pause which
 showed that he had stopped. Then
5369𓀴      once more the
 footsteps approached
 and a shadow fell across the
5370𓀴      opening of the hut.
5371𓀴
5372𓀴      “It is a lovely evening,
 my dear Watson,” said a well-known
5373𓀴      voice. “I really think that
 you will be more comfortable outside
5374𓀴      than in.”

5380𓀴Death on the Moor
5381𓀴
5382𓀴
5383𓀴      For a moment or
 two I sat breathless,
 hardly able to believe my
5384𓀴      ears. Then my senses and
 my voice came back to me, while a
5385𓀴      crushing weight
 of responsibility
 seemed in an instant to be
5386𓀴      lifted from
 my soul. That cold,
 incisive, ironical voice could
5387𓀴      belong to but one
 man in all the world.
5388𓀴
5389𓀴      “Holmes!” I cried—“Holmes!”
5390𓀴
5391𓀴      “Come out,”
 said he, “and please
 be careful with the revolver.”
5392𓀴
5393𓀴      I stooped under
 the rude lintel,
 and there he sat upon a stone
5394𓀴      outside, his
 grey eyes dancing
 with amusement as they fell upon
5395𓀴      my astonished features. He
 was thin and worn, but clear and
5396𓀴      alert, his
 keen face bronzed
 by the sun and roughened by the
5397𓀴      wind. In his tweed suit and
 cloth cap he looked like any other
5398𓀴      tourist upon the moor, and
 he had contrived, with that catlike
5399𓀴      love of personal
 cleanliness
 which was one of his
5400𓀴      characteristics,
 that his chin
 should be as smooth and his linen
5401𓀴      as perfect as if
 he were in Baker Street.
5402𓀴
5403𓀴      “I never was more glad to
 see anyone in my life,” said I as I
5404𓀴      wrung him by the hand.
5405𓀴
5406𓀴      “Or more astonished, eh?”
5407𓀴
5408𓀴      “Well, I must
 confess to it.”
5409𓀴
5410𓀴      “The surprise was not all
 on one side, I assure you. I had no
5411𓀴      idea that you had found my
 occasional retreat, still less that
5412𓀴      you were inside it, until I
 was within twenty paces of the door.”
5413𓀴
5414𓀴      “My footprint, I presume?”
5415𓀴
5416𓀴      “No, Watson,
 I fear that I could
 not undertake to recognize your
5417𓀴      footprint amid
 all the footprints
 of the world. If you seriously
5418𓀴      desire to
 deceive me you must
 change your tobacconist; for when I
5419𓀴      see the stub of a cigarette
 marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know
5420𓀴      that my friend Watson is in
 the neighbourhood. You will see it
5421𓀴      there beside the path. You
 threw it down, no doubt, at that
5422𓀴      supreme moment when you
 charged into the empty hut.”
5423𓀴
5424𓀴      “Exactly.”
5425𓀴
5426𓀴      “I thought
 as much—and knowing
 your admirable tenacity I was
5427𓀴      convinced that
 you were sitting
 in ambush, a weapon within reach,
5428𓀴      waiting for
 the tenant to return.
 So you actually thought that I
5429𓀴      was the criminal?”
5430𓀴
5431𓀴      “I did not
 know who you were,
 but I was determined to find out.”
5432𓀴
5433𓀴      “Excellent, Watson! And how
 did you localise me? You saw me,
5434𓀴      perhaps, on the night of
 the convict hunt, when I was so
5435𓀴      imprudent as to allow
 the moon to rise behind me?”
5436𓀴
5437𓀴      “Yes, I saw you then.”
5438𓀴
5439𓀴      “And have no doubt searched
 all the huts until you came to this
5440𓀴      one?”
5441𓀴
5442𓀴      “No, your boy
 had been observed,
 and that gave me a guide where
5443𓀴      to look.”
5444𓀴
5445𓀴      “The old gentleman with the
 telescope, no doubt. I could not make
5446𓀴      it out when first I saw the
 light flashing upon the lens.” He
5447𓀴      rose and peeped
 into the hut.
 “Ha, I see that Cartwright has
5448𓀴      brought up some
 supplies. What’s
 this paper? So you have been to
5449𓀴      Coombe Tracey, have you?”
5450𓀴
5451𓀴      “Yes.”
5452𓀴
5453𓀴      “To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”
5454𓀴
5455𓀴      “Exactly.”
5456𓀴
5457𓀴      “Well done! Our researches
 have evidently been running on
5458𓀴      parallel lines, and when we
 unite our results I expect we shall
5459𓀴      have a fairly full
 knowledge of the case.”
5460𓀴
5461𓀴      “Well, I am
 glad from my heart
 that you are here, for indeed the
5462𓀴      responsibility
 and the mystery
 were both becoming too much for my
5463𓀴      nerves. But how in the name
 of wonder did you come here, and what
5464𓀴      have you been
 doing? I thought
 that you were in Baker Street
5465𓀴      working out that
 case of blackmailing.”
5466𓀴
5467𓀴      “That was what
 I wished you to think.”
5468𓀴
5469𓀴      “Then you use me, and yet
 do not trust me!” I cried with some
5470𓀴      bitterness. “I think that I
 have deserved better at your hands,
5471𓀴      Holmes.”
5472𓀴
5473𓀴      “My dear fellow, you have
 been invaluable to me in this as in
5474𓀴      many other cases, and I beg
 that you will forgive me if I have
5475𓀴      seemed to play a trick upon
 you. In truth, it was partly for your
5476𓀴      own sake that I did it, and
 it was my appreciation of the danger
5477𓀴      which you ran which led me
 to come down and examine the matter
5478𓀴      for myself. Had I been with
 Sir Henry and you it is confident
5479𓀴      that my point of view would
 have been the same as yours, and my
5480𓀴      presence would
 have warned our
 very formidable opponents to be on
5481𓀴      their guard.
 As it is, I have
 been able to get about as I could
5482𓀴      not possibly have done had
 I been living in the Hall, and I
5483𓀴      remain an unknown factor in
 the business, ready to throw in all
5484𓀴      my weight at
 a critical moment.”
5485𓀴
5486𓀴      “But why keep
 me in the dark?”
5487𓀴
5488𓀴      “For you to
 know could not have
 helped us and might possibly have
5489𓀴      led to my discovery.
 You would
 have wished to tell me something,
5490𓀴      or in your
 kindness you would
 have brought me out some comfort or
5491𓀴      other, and
 so an unnecessary
 risk would be run. I brought
5492𓀴      Cartwright down with me—you
 remember the little chap at the
5493𓀴      express office—and
 he has seen
 after my simple wants: a loaf of
5494𓀴      bread and a
 clean collar. What
 does man want more? He has given
5495𓀴      me an extra
 pair of eyes upon
 a very active pair of feet, and
5496𓀴      both have been invaluable.”
5497𓀴
5498𓀴      “Then my reports
 have all been
 wasted!”—My voice trembled as I
5499𓀴      recalled the
 pains and the pride
 with which I had composed them.
5500𓀴
5501𓀴      Holmes took a bundle
 of papers from his pocket.
5502𓀴
5503𓀴      “Here are your
 reports, my dear
 fellow, and very well thumbed, I
5504𓀴      assure you.
 I made excellent
 arrangements, and they are only
5505𓀴      delayed one
 day upon their way.
 I must compliment you exceedingly
5506𓀴      upon the zeal
 and the intelligence
 which you have shown over an
5507𓀴      extraordinarily
 difficult case.”
5508𓀴
5509𓀴      I was still rather raw over
 the deception which had been
5510𓀴      practised upon me, but the
 warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my
5511𓀴      anger from
 my mind. I felt also
 in my heart that he was right in
5512𓀴      what he said
 and that it was
 really best for our purpose that I
5513𓀴      should not have known
 that he was upon the moor.
5514𓀴
5515𓀴      “That’s better,”
 said he, seeing
 the shadow rise from my face.
5516𓀴      “And now tell me the result
 of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons—it
5517𓀴      was not difficult for me to
 guess that it was to see her that you
5518𓀴      had gone, for I am already
 aware that she is the one person in
5519𓀴      Coombe Tracey who might be
 of service to us in the matter. In
5520𓀴      fact, if you
 had not gone today
 it is exceedingly probable that I
5521𓀴      should have gone tomorrow.”
5522𓀴
5523𓀴      The sun had
 set and dusk was
 settling over the moor. The air had
5524𓀴      turned chill
 and we withdrew
 into the hut for warmth. There,
5525𓀴      sitting together in the
 twilight, I told Holmes of my
5526𓀴      conversation with the lady.
 So interested was he that I had to
5527𓀴      repeat some of it twice
 before he was satisfied.
5528𓀴
5529𓀴      “This is most
 important,” said
 he when I had concluded. “It fills
5530𓀴      up a gap which
 I had been unable
 to bridge in this most complex
5531𓀴      affair. You
 are aware, perhaps,
 that a close intimacy exists
5532𓀴      between this lady
 and the man Stapleton?”
5533𓀴
5534𓀴      “I did not know
 of a close intimacy.”
5535𓀴
5536𓀴      “There can
 be no doubt about
 the matter. They meet, they write,
5537𓀴      there is a complete
 understanding
 between them. Now, this puts a
5538𓀴      very powerful
 weapon into our
 hands. If I could only use it to
5539𓀴      detach his wife—”
5540𓀴
5541𓀴      “His wife?”
5542𓀴
5543𓀴      “I am giving
 you some information
 now, in return for all that you
5544𓀴      have given me. The lady who
 has passed here as Miss Stapleton is
5545𓀴      in reality his wife.”
5546𓀴
5547𓀴      “Good heavens,
 Holmes! Are you
 sure of what you say? How could he
5548𓀴      have permitted Sir Henry
 to fall in love with her?”
5549𓀴
5550𓀴      “Sir Henry’s
 falling in love
 could do no harm to anyone except
5551𓀴      Sir Henry.
 He took particular
 care that Sir Henry did not make
5552𓀴      love to her,
 as you have yourself
 observed. I repeat that the
5553𓀴      lady is his wife
 and not his sister.”
5554𓀴
5555𓀴      “But why this
 elaborate deception?”
5556𓀴
5557𓀴      “Because he
 foresaw that she
 would be very much more useful to
5558𓀴      him in the character
 of a free woman.”
5559𓀴
5560𓀴      All my unspoken instincts,
 my vague suspicions, suddenly took
5561𓀴      shape and centred upon the
 naturalist. In that impassive
5562𓀴      colourless man, with his
 straw hat and his butterfly-net, I
5563𓀴      seemed to see
 something terrible—a
 creature of infinite patience
5564𓀴      and craft, with a smiling
 face and a murderous heart.
5565𓀴
5566𓀴      “It is he, then, who is our
 enemy—it is he who dogged us in
5567𓀴      London?”
5568𓀴
5569𓀴      “So I read the riddle.”
5570𓀴
5571𓀴      “And the warning—it
 must have come from her!”
5572𓀴
5573𓀴      “Exactly.”
5574𓀴
5575𓀴      The shape of some monstrous
 villainy, half seen, half guessed,
5576𓀴      loomed through the darkness
 which had girt me so long.
5577𓀴
5578𓀴      “But are you
 sure of this, Holmes?
 How do you know that the woman
5579𓀴      is his wife?”
5580𓀴
5581𓀴      “Because he
 so far forgot himself
 as to tell you a true piece of
5582𓀴      autobiography
 upon the occasion
 when he first met you, and I dare
5583𓀴      say he has many
 a time regretted
 it since. He was once a
5584𓀴      schoolmaster
 in the north of
 England. Now, there is no one more
5585𓀴      easy to trace
 than a schoolmaster.
 There are scholastic agencies
5586𓀴      by which one
 may identify any
 man who has been in the profession.
5587𓀴      A little investigation
 showed
 me that a school had come to grief
5588𓀴      under atrocious
 circumstances,
 and that the man who had owned
5589𓀴      it—the name
 was different—had
 disappeared with his wife. The
5590𓀴      descriptions agreed. When
 I learned that the missing man was
5591𓀴      devoted to entomology the
 identification was complete.”
5592𓀴
5593𓀴      The darkness was rising,
 but much was still hidden by the
5594𓀴      shadows.
5595𓀴
5596𓀴      “If this woman
 is in truth his
 wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons
5597𓀴      come in?” I asked.
5598𓀴
5599𓀴      “That is one of the points
 upon which your own researches have
5600𓀴      shed a light.
 Your interview
 with the lady has cleared the
5601𓀴      situation very much. I did
 not know about a projected divorce
5602𓀴      between herself and her
 husband. In that case, regarding
5603𓀴      Stapleton as
 an unmarried man,
 she counted no doubt upon becoming
5604𓀴      his wife.”
5605𓀴
5606𓀴      “And when
 she is undeceived?”
5607𓀴
5608𓀴      “Why, then
 we may find the lady
 of service. It must be our first
5609𓀴      duty to see her—both
 of us—tomorrow.
 Don’t you think, Watson,
5610𓀴      that you are away from your
 charge rather long? Your place should
5611𓀴      be at Baskerville Hall.”
5612𓀴
5613𓀴      The last red
 streaks had faded
 away in the west and night had
5614𓀴      settled upon the moor. A
 few faint stars were gleaming in a
5615𓀴      violet sky.
5616𓀴
5617𓀴      “One last
 question, Holmes,”
 I said as I rose. “Surely there is
5618𓀴      no need of
 secrecy between you
 and me. What is the meaning of it
5619𓀴      all? What is he after?”
5620𓀴
5621𓀴      Holmes’s voice
 sank as he answered:
5622𓀴
5623𓀴      “It is murder,
 Watson—refined,
 cold-blooded, deliberate murder.
5624𓀴      Do not ask
 me for particulars.
 My nets are closing upon him, even
5625𓀴      as his are upon Sir Henry,
 and with your help he is already
5626𓀴      almost at
 my mercy. There is
 but one danger which can threaten
5627𓀴      us. It is that
 he should strike
 before we are ready to do so.
5628𓀴      Another day—two
 at the most—and
 I have my case complete, but
5629𓀴      until then
 guard your charge
 as closely as ever a fond mother
5630𓀴      watched her ailing child.
 Your mission today has justified
5631𓀴      itself, and
 yet I could almost
 wish that you had not left his
5632𓀴      side. Hark!”
5633𓀴
5634𓀴      A terrible
 scream—a prolonged
 yell of horror and anguish—burst
5635𓀴      out of the silence of the
 moor. That frightful cry turned the
5636𓀴      blood to ice in my veins.
5637𓀴
5638𓀴      “Oh, my God!” I gasped.
 “What is it? What does it mean?”
5639𓀴
5640𓀴      Holmes had sprung to his
 feet, and I saw his dark, athletic
5641𓀴      outline at
 the door of the hut,
 his shoulders stooping, his head
5642𓀴      thrust forward, his face
 peering into the darkness.
5643𓀴
5644𓀴      “Hush!” he
 whispered. “Hush!”
5645𓀴
5646𓀴      The cry had
 been loud on account
 of its vehemence, but it had
5647𓀴      pealed out
 from somewhere far
 off on the shadowy plain. Now it
5648𓀴      burst upon
 our ears, nearer,
 louder, more urgent than before.
5649𓀴
5650𓀴      “Where is it?”
 Holmes whispered;
 and I knew from the thrill of
5651𓀴      his voice that he, the man
 of iron, was shaken to the soul.
5652𓀴      “Where is it, Watson?”
5653𓀴
5654𓀴      “There, I think.” I
 pointed into the darkness.
5655𓀴
5656𓀴      “No, there!”
5657𓀴
5658𓀴      Again the
 agonised cry swept
 through the silent night, louder and
5659𓀴      much nearer than ever. And
 a new sound mingled with it, a deep,
5660𓀴      muttered rumble,
 musical and
 yet menacing, rising and falling
5661𓀴      like the low, constant
 murmur of the sea.
5662𓀴
5663𓀴      “The hound!”
 cried Holmes. “Come,
 Watson, come! Great heavens, if
5664𓀴      we are too late!”
5665𓀴
5666𓀴      He had started
 running swiftly
 over the moor, and I had followed
5667𓀴      at his heels. But now from
 somewhere among the broken ground
5668𓀴      immediately in front of us
 there came one last despairing yell,
5669𓀴      and then a
 dull, heavy thud.
 We halted and listened. Not another
5670𓀴      sound broke the heavy
 silence of the windless night.
5671𓀴
5672𓀴      I saw Holmes
 put his hand to
 his forehead like a man distracted.
5673𓀴      He stamped his
 feet upon the ground.
5674𓀴
5675𓀴      “He has beaten us,
 Watson. We are too late.”
5676𓀴
5677𓀴      “No, no, surely not!”
5678𓀴
5679𓀴      “Fool that I was to hold my
 hand. And you, Watson, see what comes
5680𓀴      of abandoning your charge!
 But, by Heaven, if the worst has
5681𓀴      happened we’ll avenge him!”
5682𓀴
5683𓀴      Blindly we ran through the
 gloom, blundering against boulders,
5684𓀴      forcing our
 way through gorse
 bushes, panting up hills and
5685𓀴      rushing down
 slopes, heading
 always in the direction whence those
5686𓀴      dreadful sounds had come.
 At every rise Holmes looked eagerly
5687𓀴      round him,
 but the shadows were
 thick upon the moor, and nothing
5688𓀴      moved upon its dreary face.
5689𓀴
5690𓀴      “Can you see anything?”
5691𓀴
5692𓀴      “Nothing.”
5693𓀴
5694𓀴      “But, hark, what is that?”
5695𓀴
5696𓀴      A low moan
 had fallen upon our
 ears. There it was again upon our
5697𓀴      left! On that
 side a ridge of
 rocks ended in a sheer cliff which
5698𓀴      overlooked a stone-strewn
 slope. On its jagged face was
5699𓀴      spread-eagled
 some dark, irregular
 object. As we ran towards it
5700𓀴      the vague outline hardened
 into a definite shape. It was a
5701𓀴      prostrate man face downward
 upon the ground, the head doubled
5702𓀴      under him at
 a horrible angle,
 the shoulders rounded and the body
5703𓀴      hunched together
 as if in the
 act of throwing a somersault. So
5704𓀴      grotesque was the attitude
 that I could not for the instant
5705𓀴      realise that that moan had
 been the passing of his soul. Not a
5706𓀴      whisper, not a rustle, rose
 now from the dark figure over which
5707𓀴      we stooped. Holmes laid his
 hand upon him and held it up again
5708𓀴      with an exclamation
 of horror.
 The gleam of the match which he
5709𓀴      struck shone
 upon his clotted
 fingers and upon the ghastly pool
5710𓀴      which widened
 slowly from the
 crushed skull of the victim. And it
5711𓀴      shone upon
 something else which
 turned our hearts sick and faint
5712𓀴      within us—the body
 of Sir Henry Baskerville!
5713𓀴
5714𓀴      There was
 no chance of either
 of us forgetting that peculiar
5715𓀴      ruddy tweed suit—the very
 one which he had worn on the first
5716𓀴      morning that
 we had seen him
 in Baker Street. We caught the one
5717𓀴      clear glimpse
 of it, and then
 the match flickered and went out,
5718𓀴      even as the
 hope had gone out
 of our souls. Holmes groaned, and
5719𓀴      his face glimmered
 white through the darkness.
5720𓀴
5721𓀴      “The brute!
 The brute!” I cried
 with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes,
5722𓀴      I shall never
 forgive myself
 for having left him to his fate.”
5723𓀴
5724𓀴      “I am more
 to blame than you,
 Watson. In order to have my case
5725𓀴      well rounded and complete,
 I have thrown away the life of my
5726𓀴      client. It is the greatest
 blow which has befallen me in my
5727𓀴      career. But
 how could I know—how
 _could_ I know—that he would
5728𓀴      risk his life alone upon
 the moor in the face of all my
5729𓀴      warnings?”
5730𓀴
5731𓀴      “That we should
 have heard his
 screams—my God, those screams!—and
5732𓀴      yet have been
 unable to save
 him! Where is this brute of a hound
5733𓀴      which drove
 him to his death?
 It may be lurking among these rocks
5734𓀴      at this instant.
 And Stapleton,
 where is he? He shall answer for
5735𓀴      this deed.”
5736𓀴
5737𓀴      “He shall. I will see to
 that. Uncle and nephew have been
5738𓀴      murdered—the one frightened
 to death by the very sight of a beast
5739𓀴      which he thought
 to be supernatural,
 the other driven to his end
5740𓀴      in his wild
 flight to escape
 from it. But now we have to prove
5741𓀴      the connection between the
 man and the beast. Save from what we
5742𓀴      heard, we cannot even swear
 to the existence of the latter, since
5743𓀴      Sir Henry
 has evidently died
 from the fall. But, by heavens,
5744𓀴      cunning as
 he is, the fellow
 shall be in my power before another
5745𓀴      day is past!”
5746𓀴
5747𓀴      We stood with bitter hearts
 on either side of the mangled body,
5748𓀴      overwhelmed by this sudden
 and irrevocable disaster which had
5749𓀴      brought all
 our long and weary
 labours to so piteous an end. Then
5750𓀴      as the moon rose we climbed
 to the top of the rocks over which
5751𓀴      our poor friend had fallen,
 and from the summit we gazed out over
5752𓀴      the shadowy
 moor, half silver
 and half gloom. Far away, miles
5753𓀴      off, in the
 direction of Grimpen,
 a single steady yellow light
5754𓀴      was shining. It could only
 come from the lonely abode of the
5755𓀴      Stapletons.
 With a bitter curse
 I shook my fist at it as I gazed.
5756𓀴
5757𓀴      “Why should we
 not seize him at once?”
5758𓀴
5759𓀴      “Our case is
 not complete. The
 fellow is wary and cunning to the
5760𓀴      last degree. It is not what
 we know, but what we can prove. If we
5761𓀴      make one false move the
 villain may escape us yet.”
5762𓀴
5763𓀴      “What can we do?”
5764𓀴
5765𓀴      “There will
 be plenty for us
 to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only
5766𓀴      perform the last offices
 to our poor friend.”
5767𓀴
5768𓀴      Together we made our way
 down the precipitous slope and
5769𓀴      approached
 the body, black and
 clear against the silvered stones.
5770𓀴      The agony
 of those contorted
 limbs struck me with a spasm of pain
5771𓀴      and blurred
 my eyes with tears.
5772𓀴
5773𓀴      “We must send
 for help, Holmes!
 We cannot carry him all the way
5774𓀴      to the Hall. Good
 heavens, are you mad?”
5775𓀴
5776𓀴      He had uttered
 a cry and bent
 over the body. Now he was dancing
5777𓀴      and laughing and wringing
 my hand. Could this be my stern,
5778𓀴      self-contained friend?
 These were hidden fires, indeed!
5779𓀴
5780𓀴      “A beard! A beard!
 The man has a beard!”
5781𓀴
5782𓀴      “A beard?”
5783𓀴
5784𓀴      “It is not the baronet—it
 is—why, it is my neighbour, the
5785𓀴      convict!”
5786𓀴
5787𓀴      With feverish haste we had
 turned the body over, and that
5788𓀴      dripping beard was pointing
 up to the cold, clear moon. There
5789𓀴      could be no doubt about the
 beetling forehead, the sunken animal
5790𓀴      eyes. It was
 indeed the same
 face which had glared upon me in the
5791𓀴      light of the
 candle from over
 the rock—the face of Selden, the
5792𓀴      criminal.
5793𓀴
5794𓀴      Then in an
 instant it was all
 clear to me. I remembered how the
5795𓀴      baronet had told me that
 he had handed his old wardrobe to
5796𓀴      Barrymore.
 Barrymore had passed
 it on in order to help Selden in
5797𓀴      his escape.
 Boots, shirt, cap—it
 was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy
5798𓀴      was still black enough, but
 this man had at least deserved death
5799𓀴      by the laws of his country.
 I told Holmes how the matter stood,
5800𓀴      my heart bubbling over
 with thankfulness and joy.
5801𓀴
5802𓀴      “Then the clothes have been
 the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It
5803𓀴      is clear enough
 that the hound
 has been laid on from some article
5804𓀴      of Sir Henry’s—the
 boot which
 was abstracted in the hotel, in all
5805𓀴      probability—and so ran this
 man down. There is one very singular
5806𓀴      thing, however:
 How came Selden,
 in the darkness, to know that
5807𓀴      the hound
 was on his trail?”
5808𓀴
5809𓀴      “He heard him.”
5810𓀴
5811𓀴      “To hear a hound upon the
 moor would not work a hard man like
5812𓀴      this convict
 into such a paroxysm
 of terror that he would risk
5813𓀴      recapture
 by screaming wildly
 for help. By his cries he must have
5814𓀴      run a long
 way after he knew
 the animal was on his track. How did
5815𓀴      he know?”
5816𓀴
5817𓀴      “A greater mystery to me is
 why this hound, presuming that all
5818𓀴      our conjectures
 are correct—”
5819𓀴
5820𓀴      “I presume nothing.”
5821𓀴
5822𓀴      “Well, then, why this hound
 should be loose tonight. I suppose
5823𓀴      that it does not always run
 loose upon the moor. Stapleton would
5824𓀴      not let it go unless he had
 reason to think that Sir Henry would
5825𓀴      be there.”
5826𓀴
5827𓀴      “My difficulty is the more
 formidable of the two, for I think
5828𓀴      that we shall very shortly
 get an explanation of yours, while
5829𓀴      mine may remain forever a
 mystery. The question now is, what
5830𓀴      shall we do with
 this poor wretch’s
 body? We cannot leave it here
5831𓀴      to the foxes
 and the ravens.”
5832𓀴
5833𓀴      “I suggest that we put it
 in one of the huts until we can
5834𓀴      communicate
 with the police.”
5835𓀴
5836𓀴      “Exactly. I
 have no doubt that
 you and I could carry it so far.
5837𓀴      Halloa, Watson,
 what’s this?
 It’s the man himself, by all that’s
5838𓀴      wonderful
 and audacious! Not
 a word to show your suspicions—not a
5839𓀴      word, or my plans
 crumble to the ground.”
5840𓀴
5841𓀴      A figure was approaching us
 over the moor, and I saw the dull red
5842𓀴      glow of a cigar.
 The moon shone
 upon him, and I could distinguish
5843𓀴      the dapper shape and jaunty
 walk of the naturalist. He stopped
5844𓀴      when he saw us,
 and then came on again.
5845𓀴
5846𓀴      “Why, Dr.
 Watson, that’s not
 you, is it? You are the last man
5847𓀴      that I should have expected
 to see out on the moor at this time
5848𓀴      of night. But,
 dear me, what’s
 this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t
5849𓀴      tell me that
 it is our friend
 Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and
5850𓀴      stooped over the dead man.
 I heard a sharp intake of his breath
5851𓀴      and the cigar
 fell from his fingers.
5852𓀴
5853𓀴      “Who—who’s
 this?” he stammered.
5854𓀴
5855𓀴      “It is Selden, the man
 who escaped from Princetown.”
5856𓀴
5857𓀴      Stapleton turned
 a ghastly face
 upon us, but by a supreme effort
5858𓀴      he had overcome
 his amazement
 and his disappointment. He looked
5859𓀴      sharply from
 Holmes to me. “Dear
 me! What a very shocking affair!
5860𓀴      How did he die?”
5861𓀴
5862𓀴      “He appears
 to have broken his
 neck by falling over these rocks.
5863𓀴      My friend and
 I were strolling
 on the moor when we heard a cry.”
5864𓀴
5865𓀴      “I heard a
 cry also. That was
 what brought me out. I was uneasy
5866𓀴      about Sir Henry.”
5867𓀴
5868𓀴      “Why about Sir
 Henry in particular?”
 I could not help asking.
5869𓀴
5870𓀴      “Because I
 had suggested that
 he should come over. When he did
5871𓀴      not come I
 was surprised, and
 I naturally became alarmed for his
5872𓀴      safety when I heard cries
 upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes
5873𓀴      darted again
 from my face to
 Holmes’s—“did you hear anything else
5874𓀴      besides a cry?”
5875𓀴
5876𓀴      “No,” said
 Holmes; “did you?”
5877𓀴
5878𓀴      “No.”
5879𓀴
5880𓀴      “What do you mean, then?”
5881𓀴
5882𓀴      “Oh, you know
 the stories that
 the peasants tell about a phantom
5883𓀴      hound, and
 so on. It is said
 to be heard at night upon the moor.
5884𓀴      I was wondering if there
 were any evidence of such a sound
5885𓀴      tonight.”
5886𓀴
5887𓀴      “We heard nothing
 of the kind,” said I.
5888𓀴
5889𓀴      “And what is your theory
 of this poor fellow’s death?”
5890𓀴
5891𓀴      “I have no
 doubt that anxiety
 and exposure have driven him off
5892𓀴      his head.
 He has rushed about
 the moor in a crazy state and
5893𓀴      eventually fallen over
 here and broken his neck.”
5894𓀴
5895𓀴      “That seems
 the most reasonable
 theory,” said Stapleton, and he
5896𓀴      gave a sigh which I took to
 indicate his relief. “What do you
5897𓀴      think about it,
 Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
5898𓀴
5899𓀴      My friend bowed
 his compliments.
 “You are quick at
5900𓀴      identification,” said he.
5901𓀴
5902𓀴      “We have been expecting you
 in these parts since Dr. Watson came
5903𓀴      down. You are in
 time to see a tragedy.”
5904𓀴
5905𓀴      “Yes, indeed.
 I have no doubt
 that my friend’s explanation will
5906𓀴      cover the
 facts. I will take
 an unpleasant remembrance back to
5907𓀴      London with me tomorrow.”
5908𓀴
5909𓀴      “Oh, you return tomorrow?”
5910𓀴
5911𓀴      “That is my intention.”
5912𓀴
5913𓀴      “I hope your visit has cast
 some light upon those occurrences
5914𓀴      which have puzzled us?”
5915𓀴
5916𓀴      Holmes shrugged
 his shoulders.
5917𓀴
5918𓀴      “One cannot always have the
 success for which one hopes. An
5919𓀴      investigator
 needs facts and
 not legends or rumours. It has not
5920𓀴      been a satisfactory case.”
5921𓀴
5922𓀴      My friend spoke
 in his frankest
 and most unconcerned manner.
5923𓀴      Stapleton still looked hard
 at him. Then he turned to me.
5924𓀴
5925𓀴      “I would suggest
 carrying this
 poor fellow to my house, but it
5926𓀴      would give my sister such a
 fright that I do not feel justified
5927𓀴      in doing it.
 I think that if
 we put something over his face he
5928𓀴      will be safe
 until morning.”
5929𓀴
5930𓀴      And so it was arranged.
 Resisting Stapleton’s offer of
5931𓀴      hospitality,
 Holmes and I set
 off to Baskerville Hall, leaving
5932𓀴      the naturalist
 to return alone.
 Looking back we saw the figure
5933𓀴      moving slowly away over the
 broad moor, and behind him that one
5934𓀴      black smudge
 on the silvered
 slope which showed where the man was
5935𓀴      lying who had come
 so horribly to his end.
5936𓀴
5937𓀴      “We’re at close
 grips at last,”
 said Holmes as we walked together
5938𓀴      across the
 moor. “What a nerve
 the fellow has! How he pulled
5939𓀴      himself together
 in the face
 of what must have been a paralyzing
5940𓀴      shock when
 he found that the
 wrong man had fallen a victim to his
5941𓀴      plot. I told you in London,
 Watson, and I tell you now again,
5942𓀴      that we have never had a
 foeman more worthy of our steel.”
5943𓀴
5944𓀴      “I am sorry that
 he has seen you.”
5945𓀴
5946𓀴      “And so was I at first. But
 there was no getting out of it.”
5947𓀴
5948𓀴      “What effect
 do you think it
 will have upon his plans now that he
5949𓀴      knows you are here?”
5950𓀴
5951𓀴      “It may cause
 him to be more
 cautious, or it may drive him to
5952𓀴      desperate measures at once.
 Like most clever criminals, he may be
5953𓀴      too confident in his own
 cleverness and imagine that he has
5954𓀴      completely deceived us.”
5955𓀴
5956𓀴      “Why should we
 not arrest him at once?”
5957𓀴
5958𓀴      “My dear Watson, you were
 born to be a man of action. Your
5959𓀴      instinct is always
 to do something
 energetic. But supposing, for
5960𓀴      argument’s
 sake, that we had
 him arrested tonight, what on earth
5961𓀴      the better off should we be
 for that? We could prove nothing
5962𓀴      against him. There’s the
 devilish cunning of it! If he were
5963𓀴      acting through
 a human agent
 we could get some evidence, but if
5964𓀴      we were to drag this great
 dog to the light of day it would not
5965𓀴      help us in putting a rope
 round the neck of its master.”
5966𓀴
5967𓀴      “Surely we have a case.”
5968𓀴
5969𓀴      “Not a shadow
 of one—only surmise
 and conjecture. We should be
5970𓀴      laughed out of court if we
 came with such a story and such
5971𓀴      evidence.”
5972𓀴
5973𓀴      “There is Sir
 Charles’s death.”
5974𓀴
5975𓀴      “Found dead
 without a mark upon
 him. You and I know that he died
5976𓀴      of sheer fright,
 and we know
 also what frightened him, but how
5977𓀴      are we to get twelve stolid
 jurymen to know it? What signs are
5978𓀴      there of a hound? Where are
 the marks of its fangs? Of course we
5979𓀴      know that a
 hound does not bite
 a dead body and that Sir Charles
5980𓀴      was dead before
 ever the brute
 overtook him. But we have to prove
5981𓀴      all this, and we are
 not in a position to do it.”
5982𓀴
5983𓀴      “Well, then, tonight?”
5984𓀴
5985𓀴      “We are not much better off
 tonight. Again, there was no direct
5986𓀴      connection
 between the hound
 and the man’s death. We never saw
5987𓀴      the hound. We heard it, but
 we could not prove that it was
5988𓀴      running upon
 this man’s trail.
 There is a complete absence of
5989𓀴      motive. No, my dear fellow;
 we must reconcile ourselves to the
5990𓀴      fact that
 we have no case at
 present, and that it is worth our
5991𓀴      while to run any risk
 in order to establish one.”
5992𓀴
5993𓀴      “And how do you
 propose to do so?”
5994𓀴
5995𓀴      “I have great hopes of what
 Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when
5996𓀴      the position of affairs is
 made clear to her. And I have my own
5997𓀴      plan as well.
 Sufficient for
 tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I
5998𓀴      hope before the day is past
 to have the upper hand at last.”
5999𓀴
6000𓀴      I could draw
 nothing further
 from him, and he walked, lost in
6001𓀴      thought, as far
 as the Baskerville gates.
6002𓀴
6003𓀴      “Are you coming up?”
6004𓀴
6005𓀴      “Yes; I see
 no reason for further
 concealment. But one last word,
6006𓀴      Watson. Say
 nothing of the hound
 to Sir Henry. Let him think that
6007𓀴      Selden’s death
 was as Stapleton
 would have us believe. He will
6008𓀴      have a better nerve for the
 ordeal which he will have to undergo
6009𓀴      tomorrow,
 when he is engaged,
 if I remember your report aright,
6010𓀴      to dine with these people.”
6011𓀴
6012𓀴      “And so am I.”
6013𓀴
6014𓀴      “Then you must
 excuse yourself
 and he must go alone. That will be
6015𓀴      easily arranged.
 And now, if
 we are too late for dinner, I think
6016𓀴      that we are both
 ready for our suppers.”

6020𓀴
6021𓀴Chapter 13.
6022𓀴Fixing the Nets
6023𓀴
6024𓀴
6025𓀴      Sir Henry was
 more pleased than
 surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,
6026𓀴      for he had
 for some days been
 expecting that recent events would
6027𓀴      bring him down from London.
 He did raise his eyebrows, however,
6028𓀴      when he found
 that my friend
 had neither any luggage nor any
6029𓀴      explanations
 for its absence.
 Between us we soon supplied his
6030𓀴      wants, and
 then over a belated
 supper we explained to the baronet
6031𓀴      as much of
 our experience as
 it seemed desirable that he should
6032𓀴      know. But first
 I had the unpleasant
 duty of breaking the news to
6033𓀴      Barrymore and his wife. To
 him it may have been an unmitigated
6034𓀴      relief, but
 she wept bitterly
 in her apron. To all the world he
6035𓀴      was the man
 of violence, half
 animal and half demon; but to her
6036𓀴      he always
 remained the little
 wilful boy of her own girlhood, the
6037𓀴      child who had clung to her
 hand. Evil indeed is the man who has
6038𓀴      not one woman to mourn him.
6039𓀴
6040𓀴      “I’ve been
 moping in the house
 all day since Watson went off in
6041𓀴      the morning,”
 said the baronet.
 “I guess I should have some
6042𓀴      credit, for I have kept my
 promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go
6043𓀴      about alone
 I might have had
 a more lively evening, for I had a
6044𓀴      message from Stapleton
 asking me over there.”
6045𓀴
6046𓀴      “I have no
 doubt that you would
 have had a more lively evening,”
6047𓀴      said Holmes drily. “By the
 way, I don’t suppose you appreciate
6048𓀴      that we have
 been mourning over
 you as having broken your neck?”
6049𓀴
6050𓀴      Sir Henry opened
 his eyes. “How was that?”
6051𓀴
6052𓀴      “This poor
 wretch was dressed
 in your clothes. I fear your
6053𓀴      servant who gave them to
 him may get into trouble with the
6054𓀴      police.”
6055𓀴
6056𓀴      “That is unlikely.
 There was
 no mark on any of them, as far as I
6057𓀴      know.”
6058𓀴
6059𓀴      “That’s lucky
 for him—in fact,
 it’s lucky for all of you, since
6060𓀴      you are all
 on the wrong side
 of the law in this matter. I am not
6061𓀴      sure that
 as a conscientious
 detective my first duty is not to
6062𓀴      arrest the whole household.
 Watson’s reports are most
6063𓀴      incriminating documents.”
6064𓀴
6065𓀴      “But how about the case?”
 asked the baronet. “Have you made
6066𓀴      anything out of the tangle?
 I don’t know that Watson and I are
6067𓀴      much the wiser
 since we came down.”
6068𓀴
6069𓀴      “I think that I shall be in
 a position to make the situation
6070𓀴      rather more
 clear to you before
 long. It has been an exceedingly
6071𓀴      difficult and
 most complicated
 business. There are several points
6072𓀴      upon which we
 still want light—but
 it is coming all the same.”
6073𓀴
6074𓀴      “We’ve had one experience,
 as Watson has no doubt told you. We
6075𓀴      heard the
 hound on the moor,
 so I can swear that it is not all
6076𓀴      empty superstition.
 I had something
 to do with dogs when I was
6077𓀴      out West,
 and I know one when
 I hear one. If you can muzzle that
6078𓀴      one and put him on a chain
 I’ll be ready to swear you are the
6079𓀴      greatest detective
 of all time.”
6080𓀴
6081𓀴      “I think I will muzzle him
 and chain him all right if you will
6082𓀴      give me your help.”
6083𓀴
6084𓀴      “Whatever you tell
 me to do I will do.”
6085𓀴
6086𓀴      “Very good; and I will ask
 you also to do it blindly, without
6087𓀴      always asking the reason.”
6088𓀴
6089𓀴      “Just as you like.”
6090𓀴
6091𓀴      “If you will
 do this I think
 the chances are that our little
6092𓀴      problem will soon be
 solved. I have no doubt—”
6093𓀴
6094𓀴      He stopped
 suddenly and stared
 fixedly up over my head into the
6095𓀴      air. The lamp beat upon his
 face, and so intent was it and so
6096𓀴      still that it might have
 been that of a clear-cut classical
6097𓀴      statue, a personification
 of alertness and expectation.
6098𓀴
6099𓀴      “What is it?”
 we both cried.
6100𓀴
6101𓀴      I could see as he looked
 down that he was repressing some
6102𓀴      internal emotion.
 His features
 were still composed, but his eyes
6103𓀴      shone with
 amused exultation.
6104𓀴
6105𓀴      “Excuse the admiration of a
 connoisseur,” said he as he waved his
6106𓀴      hand towards
 the line of portraits
 which covered the opposite
6107𓀴      wall. “Watson
 won’t allow that
 I know anything of art but that is
6108𓀴      mere jealousy because our
 views upon the subject differ. Now,
6109𓀴      these are a really very
 fine series of portraits.”
6110𓀴
6111𓀴      “Well, I’m glad to hear you
 say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing
6112𓀴      with some surprise
 at my friend.
 “I don’t pretend to know much
6113𓀴      about these things, and I’d
 be a better judge of a horse or a
6114𓀴      steer than of a picture. I
 didn’t know that you found time for
6115𓀴      such things.”
6116𓀴
6117𓀴      “I know what is good when I
 see it, and I see it now. That’s a
6118𓀴      Kneller, I’ll
 swear, that lady
 in the blue silk over yonder, and
6119𓀴      the stout
 gentleman with the
 wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are
6120𓀴      all family portraits,
 I presume?”
6121𓀴
6122𓀴      “Every one.”
6123𓀴
6124𓀴      “Do you know the names?”
6125𓀴
6126𓀴      “Barrymore
 has been coaching
 me in them, and I think I can say my
6127𓀴      lessons fairly well.”
6128𓀴
6129𓀴      “Who is the gentleman
 with the telescope?”
6130𓀴
6131𓀴      “That is Rear-Admiral
 Baskerville,
 who served under Rodney in the
6132𓀴      West Indies.
 The man with the
 blue coat and the roll of paper is
6133𓀴      Sir William
 Baskerville, who
 was Chairman of Committees of the
6134𓀴      House of Commons
 under Pitt.”
6135𓀴
6136𓀴      “And this Cavalier opposite
 to me—the one with the black velvet
6137𓀴      and the lace?”
6138𓀴
6139𓀴      “Ah, you have
 a right to know
 about him. That is the cause of all
6140𓀴      the mischief, the wicked
 Hugo, who started the Hound of the
6141𓀴      Baskervilles. We’re
 not likely to forget him.”
6142𓀴
6143𓀴      I gazed with interest and
 some surprise upon the portrait.
6144𓀴
6145𓀴      “Dear me!” said Holmes, “he
 seems a quiet, meek-mannered man
6146𓀴      enough, but I dare say that
 there was a lurking devil in his
6147𓀴      eyes. I had pictured him as
 a more robust and ruffianly person.”
6148𓀴
6149𓀴      “There’s no doubt about the
 authenticity, for the name and the
6150𓀴      date, 1647, are on
 the back of the canvas.”
6151𓀴
6152𓀴      Holmes said
 little more, but
 the picture of the old roysterer
6153𓀴      seemed to
 have a fascination
 for him, and his eyes were
6154𓀴      continually
 fixed upon it during
 supper. It was not until later,
6155𓀴      when Sir Henry had gone to
 his room, that I was able to follow
6156𓀴      the trend of his thoughts.
 He led me back into the
6157𓀴      banqueting-hall,
 his bedroom
 candle in his hand, and he held it
6158𓀴      up against the time-stained
 portrait on the wall.
6159𓀴
6160𓀴      “Do you see
 anything there?”
6161𓀴
6162𓀴      I looked at
 the broad plumed
 hat, the curling love-locks, the
6163𓀴      white lace collar,
 and the straight,
 severe face which was framed
6164𓀴      between them. It was not a
 brutal countenance, but it was prim,
6165𓀴      hard, and stern,
 with a firm-set,
 thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly
6166𓀴      intolerant eye.
6167𓀴
6168𓀴      “Is it like
 anyone you know?”
6169𓀴
6170𓀴      “There is something
 of Sir Henry about the jaw.”
6171𓀴
6172𓀴      “Just a suggestion,
 perhaps.
 But wait an instant!” He stood upon
6173𓀴      a chair, and,
 holding up the
 light in his left hand, he curved
6174𓀴      his right
 arm over the broad
 hat and round the long ringlets.
6175𓀴
6176𓀴      “Good heavens!”
 I cried in amazement.
6177𓀴
6178𓀴      The face of Stapleton
 had sprung out of the canvas.
6179𓀴
6180𓀴      “Ha, you see
 it now. My eyes
 have been trained to examine faces
6181𓀴      and not their trimmings. It
 is the first quality of a criminal
6182𓀴      investigator that he should
 see through a disguise.”
6183𓀴
6184𓀴      “But this is marvellous.
 It might be his portrait.”
6185𓀴
6186𓀴      “Yes, it is an
 interesting instance
 of a throwback, which appears
6187𓀴      to be both physical
 and spiritual.
 A study of family portraits is
6188𓀴      enough to convert a man to
 the doctrine of reincarnation. The
6189𓀴      fellow is
 a Baskerville—that
 is evident.”
6190𓀴
6191𓀴      “With designs
 upon the succession.”
6192𓀴
6193𓀴      “Exactly.
 This chance of the
 picture has supplied us with one of
6194𓀴      our most obvious
 missing links.
 We have him, Watson, we have him,
6195𓀴      and I dare
 swear that before
 tomorrow night he will be fluttering
6196𓀴      in our net
 as helpless as one
 of his own butterflies. A pin, a
6197𓀴      cork, and
 a card, and we add
 him to the Baker Street collection!”
6198𓀴      He burst into
 one of his rare
 fits of laughter as he turned away
6199𓀴      from the picture.
 I have not
 heard him laugh often, and it has
6200𓀴      always boded
 ill to somebody.
6201𓀴
6202𓀴      I was up betimes
 in the morning,
 but Holmes was afoot earlier
6203𓀴      still, for I saw him as
 I dressed, coming up the drive.
6204𓀴
6205𓀴      “Yes, we should have a full
 day today,” he remarked, and he
6206𓀴      rubbed his hands with the
 joy of action. “The nets are all in
6207𓀴      place, and
 the drag is about
 to begin. We’ll know before the day
6208𓀴      is out whether
 we have caught
 our big, lean-jawed pike, or
6209𓀴      whether he has
 got through the meshes.”
6210𓀴
6211𓀴      “Have you been
 on the moor already?”
6212𓀴
6213𓀴      “I have sent
 a report from Grimpen
 to Princetown as to the death
6214𓀴      of Selden. I think I can
 promise that none of you will be
6215𓀴      troubled in the matter. And
 I have also communicated with my
6216𓀴      faithful Cartwright,
 who would
 certainly have pined away at the
6217𓀴      door of my
 hut, as a dog does
 at his master’s grave, if I had not
6218𓀴      set his mind at
 rest about my safety.”
6219𓀴
6220𓀴      “What is the next move?”
6221𓀴
6222𓀴      “To see Sir Henry.
 Ah, here he is!”
6223𓀴
6224𓀴      “Good-morning,
 Holmes,” said
 the baronet. “You look like a
6225𓀴      general who
 is planning a battle
 with his chief of the staff.”
6226𓀴
6227𓀴      “That is the
 exact situation.
 Watson was asking for orders.”
6228𓀴
6229𓀴      “And so do I.”
6230𓀴
6231𓀴      “Very good.
 You are engaged,
 as I understand, to dine with our
6232𓀴      friends the
 Stapletons tonight.”
6233𓀴
6234𓀴      “I hope that
 you will come also.
 They are very hospitable people,
6235𓀴      and I am sure that they
 would be very glad to see you.”
6236𓀴
6237𓀴      “I fear that Watson
 and I must go to London.”
6238𓀴
6239𓀴      “To London?”
6240𓀴
6241𓀴      “Yes, I think
 that we should
 be more useful there at the present
6242𓀴      juncture.”
6243𓀴
6244𓀴      The baronet’s face
 perceptibly lengthened.
6245𓀴
6246𓀴      “I hoped that
 you were going
 to see me through this business. The
6247𓀴      Hall and the moor are not
 very pleasant places when one is
6248𓀴      alone.”
6249𓀴
6250𓀴      “My dear fellow,
 you must trust
 me implicitly and do exactly what
6251𓀴      I tell you.
 You can tell your
 friends that we should have been
6252𓀴      happy to have
 come with you,
 but that urgent business required us
6253𓀴      to be in town. We hope very
 soon to return to Devonshire. Will
6254𓀴      you remember to
 give them that message?”
6255𓀴
6256𓀴      “If you insist upon it.”
6257𓀴
6258𓀴      “There is no alternative,
 I assure you.”
6259𓀴
6260𓀴      I saw by the
 baronet’s clouded
 brow that he was deeply hurt by
6261𓀴      what he regarded
 as our desertion.
6262𓀴
6263𓀴      “When do you desire
 to go?” he asked coldly.
6264𓀴
6265𓀴      “Immediately
 after breakfast.
 We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,
6266𓀴      but Watson will
 leave his things
 as a pledge that he will come
6267𓀴      back to you.
 Watson, you will
 send a note to Stapleton to tell
6268𓀴      him that you regret
 that you cannot come.”
6269𓀴
6270𓀴      “I have a
 good mind to go to
 London with you,” said the baronet.
6271𓀴      “Why should
 I stay here alone?”
6272𓀴
6273𓀴      “Because it is your post of
 duty. Because you gave me your word
6274𓀴      that you would
 do as you were
 told, and I tell you to stay.”
6275𓀴
6276𓀴      “All right,
 then, I’ll stay.”
6277𓀴
6278𓀴      “One more direction! I wish
 you to drive to Merripit House. Send
6279𓀴      back your
 trap, however, and
 let them know that you intend to
6280𓀴      walk home.”
6281𓀴
6282𓀴      “To walk across the moor?”
6283𓀴
6284𓀴      “Yes.”
6285𓀴
6286𓀴      “But that is the very thing
 which you have so often cautioned me
6287𓀴      not to do.”
6288𓀴
6289𓀴      “This time you may do it
 with safety. If I had not every
6290𓀴      confidence
 in your nerve and
 courage I would not suggest it, but
6291𓀴      it is essential
 that you should do it.”
6292𓀴
6293𓀴      “Then I will do it.”
6294𓀴
6295𓀴      “And as you value your life
 do not go across the moor in any
6296𓀴      direction save
 along the straight
 path which leads from Merripit
6297𓀴      House to the Grimpen Road,
 and is your natural way home.”
6298𓀴
6299𓀴      “I will do
 just what you say.”
6300𓀴
6301𓀴      “Very good.
 I should be glad
 to get away as soon after breakfast
6302𓀴      as possible, so as to
 reach London in the afternoon.”
6303𓀴
6304𓀴      I was much
 astounded by this
 programme, though I remembered that
6305𓀴      Holmes had
 said to Stapleton
 on the night before that his visit
6306𓀴      would terminate next day.
 It had not crossed my mind however,
6307𓀴      that he would wish me to go
 with him, nor could I understand how
6308𓀴      we could both
 be absent at a
 moment which he himself declared to
6309𓀴      be critical.
 There was nothing
 for it, however, but implicit
6310𓀴      obedience;
 so we bade good-bye
 to our rueful friend, and a couple
6311𓀴      of hours afterwards we were
 at the station of Coombe Tracey and
6312𓀴      had dispatched
 the trap upon
 its return journey. A small boy was
6313𓀴      waiting upon the platform.
6314𓀴
6315𓀴      “Any orders, sir?”
6316𓀴
6317𓀴      “You will take this train
 to town, Cartwright. The moment you
6318𓀴      arrive you will send a wire
 to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,
6319𓀴      to say that if he finds the
 pocketbook which I have dropped he is
6320𓀴      to send it by registered
 post to Baker Street.”
6321𓀴
6322𓀴      “Yes, sir.”
6323𓀴
6324𓀴      “And ask at
 the station office
 if there is a message for me.”
6325𓀴
6326𓀴      The boy returned
 with a telegram,
 which Holmes handed to me. It
6327𓀴      ran:
6328𓀴
6329𓀴      Wire received. Coming down
 with unsigned warrant. Arrive
6330𓀴      five-forty. Lestrade.
6331𓀴
6332𓀴      “That is in
 answer to mine of
 this morning. He is the best of the
6333𓀴      professionals, I think, and
 we may need his assistance. Now,
6334𓀴      Watson, I think
 that we cannot
 employ our time better than by
6335𓀴      calling upon
 your acquaintance,
 Mrs. Laura Lyons.”
6336𓀴
6337𓀴      His plan of campaign
 was beginning
 to be evident. He would use
6338𓀴      the baronet
 in order to convince
 the Stapletons that we were
6339𓀴      really gone,
 while we should
 actually return at the instant when
6340𓀴      we were likely
 to be needed.
 That telegram from London, if
6341𓀴      mentioned
 by Sir Henry to the
 Stapletons, must remove the last
6342𓀴      suspicions
 from their minds.
 Already I seemed to see our nets
6343𓀴      drawing closer around
 that lean-jawed pike.
6344𓀴
6345𓀴      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her
 office, and Sherlock Holmes opened
6346𓀴      his interview
 with a frankness
 and directness which considerably
6347𓀴      amazed her.
6348𓀴
6349𓀴      “I am investigating
 the circumstances
 which attended the death of
6350𓀴      the late Sir
 Charles Baskerville,”
 said he. “My friend here, Dr.
6351𓀴      Watson, has informed me of
 what you have communicated, and also
6352𓀴      of what you have withheld
 in connection with that matter.”
6353𓀴
6354𓀴      “What have I withheld?”
 she asked defiantly.
6355𓀴
6356𓀴      “You have
 confessed that you
 asked Sir Charles to be at the gate
6357𓀴      at ten o’clock.
 We know that
 that was the place and hour of his
6358𓀴      death. You
 have withheld what
 the connection is between these
6359𓀴      events.”
6360𓀴
6361𓀴      “There is no connection.”
6362𓀴
6363𓀴      “In that case
 the coincidence
 must indeed be an extraordinary
6364𓀴      one. But I think that we
 shall succeed in establishing a
6365𓀴      connection,
 after all. I wish
 to be perfectly frank with you,
6366𓀴      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this
 case as one of murder, and the
6367𓀴      evidence may
 implicate not only
 your friend Mr. Stapleton but his
6368𓀴      wife as well.”
6369𓀴
6370𓀴      The lady sprang
 from her chair.
6371𓀴
6372𓀴      “His wife!” she cried.
6373𓀴
6374𓀴      “The fact is
 no longer a secret.
 The person who has passed for
6375𓀴      his sister
 is really his wife.”
6376𓀴
6377𓀴      Mrs. Lyons had
 resumed her seat.
 Her hands were grasping the arms
6378𓀴      of her chair,
 and I saw that
 the pink nails had turned white with
6379𓀴      the pressure of her grip.
6380𓀴
6381𓀴      “His wife!” she said again.
 “His wife! He is not a married man.”
6382𓀴
6383𓀴      Sherlock Holmes
 shrugged his shoulders.
6384𓀴
6385𓀴      “Prove it to me! Prove it
 to me! And if you can do so—!”
6386𓀴
6387𓀴      The fierce flash of her
 eyes said more than any words.
6388𓀴
6389𓀴      “I have come prepared to do
 so,” said Holmes, drawing several
6390𓀴      papers from
 his pocket. “Here
 is a photograph of the couple taken
6391𓀴      in York four
 years ago. It is
 indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’
6392𓀴      but you will
 have no difficulty
 in recognizing him, and her also,
6393𓀴      if you know
 her by sight. Here
 are three written descriptions by
6394𓀴      trustworthy
 witnesses of Mr.
 and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time
6395𓀴      kept St. Oliver’s
 private school.
 Read them and see if you can
6396𓀴      doubt the identity
 of these people.”
6397𓀴
6398𓀴      She glanced
 at them, and then
 looked up at us with the set, rigid
6399𓀴      face of a desperate woman.
6400𓀴
6401𓀴      “Mr. Holmes,”
 she said, “this
 man had offered me marriage on
6402𓀴      condition
 that I could get a
 divorce from my husband. He has lied
6403𓀴      to me, the
 villain, in every
 conceivable way. Not one word of
6404𓀴      truth has he ever told me.
 And why—why? I imagined that all was
6405𓀴      for my own sake. But now I
 see that I was never anything but a
6406𓀴      tool in his
 hands. Why should
 I preserve faith with him who never
6407𓀴      kept any with
 me? Why should
 I try to shield him from the
6408𓀴      consequences
 of his own wicked
 acts? Ask me what you like, and
6409𓀴      there is nothing
 which I shall
 hold back. One thing I swear to
6410𓀴      you, and that
 is that when I
 wrote the letter I never dreamed of
6411𓀴      any harm to
 the old gentleman,
 who had been my kindest friend.”
6412𓀴
6413𓀴      “I entirely believe you,
 madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The
6414𓀴      recital of
 these events must
 be very painful to you, and perhaps
6415𓀴      it will make it easier if I
 tell you what occurred, and you can
6416𓀴      check me if
 I make any material
 mistake. The sending of this
6417𓀴      letter was suggested
 to you by Stapleton?”
6418𓀴
6419𓀴      “He dictated it.”
6420𓀴
6421𓀴      “I presume that the reason
 he gave was that you would receive
6422𓀴      help from
 Sir Charles for the
 legal expenses connected with your
6423𓀴      divorce?”
6424𓀴
6425𓀴      “Exactly.”
6426𓀴
6427𓀴      “And then
 after you had sent
 the letter he dissuaded you from
6428𓀴      keeping the appointment?”
6429𓀴
6430𓀴      “He told me
 that it would hurt
 his self-respect that any other
6431𓀴      man should
 find the money for
 such an object, and that though he
6432𓀴      was a poor
 man himself he would
 devote his last penny to removing
6433𓀴      the obstacles
 which divided us.”
6434𓀴
6435𓀴      “He appears to
 be a very consistent
 character. And then you heard
6436𓀴      nothing until you read the
 reports of the death in the paper?”
6437𓀴
6438𓀴      “No.”
6439𓀴
6440𓀴      “And he made
 you swear to say
 nothing about your appointment with
6441𓀴      Sir Charles?”
6442𓀴
6443𓀴      “He did. He
 said that the death
 was a very mysterious one, and
6444𓀴      that I should certainly be
 suspected if the facts came out. He
6445𓀴      frightened me
 into remaining silent.”
6446𓀴
6447𓀴      “Quite so. But you
 had your suspicions?”
6448𓀴
6449𓀴      She hesitated
 and looked down.
6450𓀴
6451𓀴      “I knew him,”
 she said. “But
 if he had kept faith with me I
6452𓀴      should always
 have done so with him.”
6453𓀴
6454𓀴      “I think that
 on the whole you
 have had a fortunate escape,” said
6455𓀴      Sherlock Holmes.
 “You have had
 him in your power and he knew it,
6456𓀴      and yet you
 are alive. You have
 been walking for some months very
6457𓀴      near to the
 edge of a precipice.
 We must wish you good-morning
6458𓀴      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is
 probable that you will very shortly
6459𓀴      hear from us again.”
6460𓀴
6461𓀴      “Our case becomes
 rounded off,
 and difficulty after difficulty
6462𓀴      thins away in front of us,”
 said Holmes as we stood waiting for
6463𓀴      the arrival of the express
 from town. “I shall soon be in the
6464𓀴      position of
 being able to put
 into a single connected narrative
6465𓀴      one of the
 most singular and
 sensational crimes of modern times.
6466𓀴      Students of
 criminology will
 remember the analogous incidents in
6467𓀴      Godno, in Little Russia, in
 the year ’66, and of course there are
6468𓀴      the Anderson
 murders in North
 Carolina, but this case possesses
6469𓀴      some features
 which are entirely
 its own. Even now we have no
6470𓀴      clear case
 against this very
 wily man. But I shall be very much
6471𓀴      surprised
 if it is not clear
 enough before we go to bed this
6472𓀴      night.”
6473𓀴
6474𓀴      The London
 express came roaring
 into the station, and a small,
6475𓀴      wiry bulldog
 of a man had sprung
 from a first-class carriage. We
6476𓀴      all three
 shook hands, and I
 saw at once from the reverential way
6477𓀴      in which Lestrade gazed at
 my companion that he had learned a
6478𓀴      good deal
 since the days when
 they had first worked together. I
6479𓀴      could well
 remember the scorn
 which the theories of the reasoner
6480𓀴      used then to excite
 in the practical man.
6481𓀴
6482𓀴      “Anything good?” he asked.
6483𓀴
6484𓀴      “The biggest
 thing for years,”
 said Holmes. “We have two hours
6485𓀴      before we need
 think of starting.
 I think we might employ it in
6486𓀴      getting some
 dinner and then,
 Lestrade, we will take the London
6487𓀴      fog out of your
 throat by giving
 you a breath of the pure night
6488𓀴      air of Dartmoor. Never been
 there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you
6489𓀴      will forget
 your first visit.”

6495𓀴The Hound of the Baskervilles
6496𓀴
6497𓀴
6498𓀴      One of Sherlock
 Holmes’s defects—if,
 indeed, one may call it a
6499𓀴      defect—was that
 he was exceedingly
 loath to communicate his full
6500𓀴      plans to any
 other person until
 the instant of their fulfilment.
6501𓀴      Partly it
 came no doubt from
 his own masterful nature, which
6502𓀴      loved to dominate
 and surprise
 those who were around him. Partly
6503𓀴      also from his
 professional caution,
 which urged him never to take
6504𓀴      any chances.
 The result, however,
 was very trying for those who
6505𓀴      were acting
 as his agents and
 assistants. I had often suffered
6506𓀴      under it, but never more so
 than during that long drive in the
6507𓀴      darkness. The great ordeal
 was in front of us; at last we were
6508𓀴      about to make
 our final effort,
 and yet Holmes had said nothing,
6509𓀴      and I could
 only surmise what
 his course of action would be. My
6510𓀴      nerves thrilled
 with anticipation
 when at last the cold wind upon
6511𓀴      our faces
 and the dark, void
 spaces on either side of the narrow
6512𓀴      road told me
 that we were back
 upon the moor once again. Every
6513𓀴      stride of the
 horses and every
 turn of the wheels was taking us
6514𓀴      nearer to our
 supreme adventure.
6515𓀴
6516𓀴      Our conversation
 was hampered
 by the presence of the driver of
6517𓀴      the hired
 wagonette, so that
 we were forced to talk of trivial
6518𓀴      matters when
 our nerves were
 tense with emotion and anticipation.
6519𓀴      It was a relief
 to me, after
 that unnatural restraint, when we at
6520𓀴      last passed
 Frankland’s house
 and knew that we were drawing near
6521𓀴      to the Hall
 and to the scene
 of action. We did not drive up to
6522𓀴      the door but
 got down near the
 gate of the avenue. The wagonette
6523𓀴      was paid off and ordered to
 return to Coombe Tracey forthwith,
6524𓀴      while we started
 to walk to Merripit House.
6525𓀴
6526𓀴      “Are you armed, Lestrade?”
6527𓀴
6528𓀴      The little
 detective smiled.
 “As long as I have my trousers I
6529𓀴      have a hip-pocket, and as
 long as I have my hip-pocket I have
6530𓀴      something in it.”
6531𓀴
6532𓀴      “Good! My friend and I
 are also ready for emergencies.”
6533𓀴
6534𓀴      “You’re mighty close about
 this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the
6535𓀴      game now?”
6536𓀴
6537𓀴      “A waiting game.”
6538𓀴
6539𓀴      “My word, it does not seem
 a very cheerful place,” said the
6540𓀴      detective with
 a shiver, glancing
 round him at the gloomy slopes
6541𓀴      of the hill and at the huge
 lake of fog which lay over the
6542𓀴      Grimpen Mire. “I see the
 lights of a house ahead of us.”
6543𓀴
6544𓀴      “That is Merripit House and
 the end of our journey. I must
6545𓀴      request you
 to walk on tiptoe
 and not to talk above a whisper.”
6546𓀴
6547𓀴      We moved cautiously
 along the
 track as if we were bound for the
6548𓀴      house, but Holmes halted us
 when we were about two hundred yards
6549𓀴      from it.
6550𓀴
6551𓀴      “This will
 do,” said he. “These
 rocks upon the right make an
6552𓀴      admirable screen.”
6553𓀴
6554𓀴      “We are to wait here?”
6555𓀴
6556𓀴      “Yes, we shall
 make our little
 ambush here. Get into this hollow,
6557𓀴      Lestrade. You
 have been inside
 the house, have you not, Watson?
6558𓀴      Can you tell
 the position of
 the rooms? What are those latticed
6559𓀴      windows at this end?”
6560𓀴
6561𓀴      “I think they are
 the kitchen windows.”
6562𓀴
6563𓀴      “And the one beyond,
 which shines so brightly?”
6564𓀴
6565𓀴      “That is certainly
 the dining-room.”
6566𓀴
6567𓀴      “The blinds
 are up. You know
 the lie of the land best. Creep
6568𓀴      forward quietly
 and see what
 they are doing—but for heaven’s sake
6569𓀴      don’t let them know
 that they are watched!”
6570𓀴
6571𓀴      I tiptoed down the path and
 stooped behind the low wall which
6572𓀴      surrounded
 the stunted orchard.
 Creeping in its shadow I reached
6573𓀴      a point whence I could look
 straight through the uncurtained
6574𓀴      window.
6575𓀴
6576𓀴      There were only two men in
 the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.
6577𓀴      They sat with
 their profiles
 towards me on either side of the
6578𓀴      round table. Both of them
 were smoking cigars, and coffee and
6579𓀴      wine were in front of them.
 Stapleton was talking with animation,
6580𓀴      but the baronet looked pale
 and distrait. Perhaps the thought of
6581𓀴      that lonely walk across the
 ill-omened moor was weighing heavily
6582𓀴      upon his mind.
6583𓀴
6584𓀴      As I watched them Stapleton
 rose and left the room, while Sir
6585𓀴      Henry filled
 his glass again
 and leaned back in his chair,
6586𓀴      puffing at
 his cigar. I heard
 the creak of a door and the crisp
6587𓀴      sound of boots upon gravel.
 The steps passed along the path on
6588𓀴      the other side
 of the wall under
 which I crouched. Looking over,
6589𓀴      I saw the naturalist pause
 at the door of an out-house in the
6590𓀴      corner of
 the orchard. A key
 turned in a lock, and as he passed
6591𓀴      in there was
 a curious scuffling
 noise from within. He was only a
6592𓀴      minute or
 so inside, and then
 I heard the key turn once more and
6593𓀴      he passed me
 and reentered the
 house. I saw him rejoin his guest,
6594𓀴      and I crept quietly back to
 where my companions were waiting to
6595𓀴      tell them what I had seen.
6596𓀴
6597𓀴      “You say, Watson,
 that the lady
 is not there?” Holmes asked when
6598𓀴      I had finished my report.
6599𓀴
6600𓀴      “No.”
6601𓀴
6602𓀴      “Where can
 she be, then, since
 there is no light in any other
6603𓀴      room except the kitchen?”
6604𓀴
6605𓀴      “I cannot think
 where she is.”
6606𓀴
6607𓀴      I have said
 that over the great
 Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,
6608𓀴      white fog. It was drifting
 slowly in our direction and banked
6609𓀴      itself up
 like a wall on that
 side of us, low but thick and well
6610𓀴      defined. The moon shone
 on it, and it looked like a great
6611𓀴      shimmering
 ice-field, with the
 heads of the distant tors as rocks
6612𓀴      borne upon its
 surface. Holmes’s
 face was turned towards it, and
6613𓀴      he muttered impatiently
 as he watched its sluggish drift.
6614𓀴
6615𓀴      “It’s moving
 towards us, Watson.”
6616𓀴
6617𓀴      “Is that serious?”
6618𓀴
6619𓀴      “Very serious,
 indeed—the one
 thing upon earth which could have
6620𓀴      disarranged
 my plans. He can’t
 be very long, now. It is already
6621𓀴      ten o’clock.
 Our success and
 even his life may depend upon his
6622𓀴      coming out before
 the fog is over the path.”
6623𓀴
6624𓀴      The night
 was clear and fine
 above us. The stars shone cold and
6625𓀴      bright, while a half-moon
 bathed the whole scene in a soft,
6626𓀴      uncertain light. Before us
 lay the dark bulk of the house, its
6627𓀴      serrated roof and bristling
 chimneys hard outlined against the
6628𓀴      silver-spangled sky. Broad
 bars of golden light from the lower
6629𓀴      windows stretched
 across the
 orchard and the moor. One of them
6630𓀴      was suddenly shut off. The
 servants had left the kitchen. There
6631𓀴      only remained
 the lamp in the
 dining-room where the two men, the
6632𓀴      murderous host
 and the unconscious
 guest, still chatted over
6633𓀴      their cigars.
6634𓀴
6635𓀴      Every minute
 that white woolly
 plain which covered one-half of
6636𓀴      the moor was
 drifting closer
 and closer to the house. Already the
6637𓀴      first thin wisps of it were
 curling across the golden square of
6638𓀴      the lighted
 window. The farther
 wall of the orchard was already
6639𓀴      invisible,
 and the trees were
 standing out of a swirl of white
6640𓀴      vapour. As
 we watched it the
 fog-wreaths came crawling round both
6641𓀴      corners of
 the house and rolled
 slowly into one dense bank on
6642𓀴      which the
 upper floor and the
 roof floated like a strange ship
6643𓀴      upon a shadowy
 sea. Holmes struck
 his hand passionately upon the
6644𓀴      rock in front
 of us and stamped
 his feet in his impatience.
6645𓀴
6646𓀴      “If he isn’t
 out in a quarter
 of an hour the path will be
6647𓀴      covered. In half an hour we
 won’t be able to see our hands in
6648𓀴      front of us.”
6649𓀴
6650𓀴      “Shall we move farther
 back upon higher ground?”
6651𓀴
6652𓀴      “Yes, I think
 it would be as well.”
6653𓀴
6654𓀴      So as the fog-bank
 flowed onward
 we fell back before it until we
6655𓀴      were half a
 mile from the house,
 and still that dense white sea,
6656𓀴      with the moon silvering
 its upper edge, swept slowly and
6657𓀴      inexorably on.
6658𓀴
6659𓀴      “We are going
 too far,” said
 Holmes. “We dare not take the chance
6660𓀴      of his being
 overtaken before
 he can reach us. At all costs we
6661𓀴      must hold our ground where
 we are.” He dropped on his knees and
6662𓀴      clapped his
 ear to the ground.
 “Thank God, I think that I hear
6663𓀴      him coming.”
6664𓀴
6665𓀴      A sound of
 quick steps broke
 the silence of the moor. Crouching
6666𓀴      among the stones
 we stared intently
 at the silver-tipped bank in
6667𓀴      front of us. The steps grew
 louder, and through the fog, as
6668𓀴      through a curtain,
 there stepped
 the man whom we were awaiting.
6669𓀴      He looked round
 him in surprise
 as he emerged into the clear,
6670𓀴      starlit night. Then he came
 swiftly along the path, passed close
6671𓀴      to where we
 lay, and went on
 up the long slope behind us. As he
6672𓀴      walked he
 glanced continually
 over either shoulder, like a man
6673𓀴      who is ill at ease.
6674𓀴
6675𓀴      “Hist!” cried Holmes, and I
 heard the sharp click of a cocking
6676𓀴      pistol. “Look
 out! It’s coming!”
6677𓀴
6678𓀴      There was a thin,
 crisp, continuous
 patter from somewhere in the
6679𓀴      heart of that
 crawling bank.
 The cloud was within fifty yards of
6680𓀴      where we lay, and we glared
 at it, all three, uncertain what
6681𓀴      horror was
 about to break from
 the heart of it. I was at Holmes’s
6682𓀴      elbow, and I glanced for an
 instant at his face. It was pale and
6683𓀴      exultant, his eyes shining
 brightly in the moonlight. But
6684𓀴      suddenly they
 started forward
 in a rigid, fixed stare, and his
6685𓀴      lips parted in amazement.
 At the same instant Lestrade gave a
6686𓀴      yell of terror
 and threw himself
 face downward upon the ground. I
6687𓀴      sprang to my feet, my inert
 hand grasping my pistol, my mind
6688𓀴      paralyzed by
 the dreadful shape
 which had sprung out upon us from
6689𓀴      the shadows
 of the fog. A hound
 it was, an enormous coal-black
6690𓀴      hound, but not such a hound
 as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire
6691𓀴      burst from its open mouth,
 its eyes glowed with a smouldering
6692𓀴      glare, its
 muzzle and hackles
 and dewlap were outlined in
6693𓀴      flickering flame. Never in
 the delirious dream of a disordered
6694𓀴      brain could
 anything more savage,
 more appalling, more hellish be
6695𓀴      conceived
 than that dark form
 and savage face which broke upon us
6696𓀴      out of the wall of fog.
6697𓀴
6698𓀴      With long bounds the huge
 black creature was leaping down the
6699𓀴      track, following hard upon
 the footsteps of our friend. So
6700𓀴      paralyzed were
 we by the apparition
 that we allowed him to pass
6701𓀴      before we had recovered our
 nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired
6702𓀴      together, and
 the creature gave
 a hideous howl, which showed that
6703𓀴      one at least
 had hit him. He
 did not pause, however, but bounded
6704𓀴      onward. Far
 away on the path
 we saw Sir Henry looking back, his
6705𓀴      face white
 in the moonlight,
 his hands raised in horror, glaring
6706𓀴      helplessly at the frightful
 thing which was hunting him down. But
6707𓀴      that cry of
 pain from the hound
 had blown all our fears to the
6708𓀴      winds. If he was vulnerable
 he was mortal, and if we could wound
6709𓀴      him we could
 kill him. Never
 have I seen a man run as Holmes ran
6710𓀴      that night.
 I am reckoned fleet
 of foot, but he outpaced me as
6711𓀴      much as I
 outpaced the little
 professional. In front of us as we
6712𓀴      flew up the
 track we heard scream
 after scream from Sir Henry and
6713𓀴      the deep roar of the hound.
 I was in time to see the beast spring
6714𓀴      upon its victim,
 hurl him to
 the ground, and worry at his throat.
6715𓀴      But the next instant Holmes
 had emptied five barrels of his
6716𓀴      revolver into
 the creature’s
 flank. With a last howl of agony and
6717𓀴      a vicious snap in the air,
 it rolled upon its back, four feet
6718𓀴      pawing furiously, and then
 fell limp upon its side. I stooped,
6719𓀴      panting, and
 pressed my pistol
 to the dreadful, shimmering head,
6720𓀴      but it was useless to press
 the trigger. The giant hound was
6721𓀴      dead.
6722𓀴
6723𓀴      Sir Henry lay
 insensible where
 he had fallen. We tore away his
6724𓀴      collar, and Holmes breathed
 a prayer of gratitude when we saw
6725𓀴      that there was no sign of a
 wound and that the rescue had been in
6726𓀴      time. Already
 our friend’s eyelids
 shivered and he made a feeble
6727𓀴      effort to move.
 Lestrade thrust
 his brandy-flask between the
6728𓀴      baronet’s teeth,
 and two frightened
 eyes were looking up at us.
6729𓀴
6730𓀴      “My God!”
 he whispered. “What
 was it? What, in heaven’s name, was
6731𓀴      it?”
6732𓀴
6733𓀴      “It’s dead,
 whatever it is,”
 said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family
6734𓀴      ghost once and forever.”
6735𓀴
6736𓀴      In mere size
 and strength it
 was a terrible creature which was
6737𓀴      lying stretched before us.
 It was not a pure bloodhound and it
6738𓀴      was not a pure mastiff; but
 it appeared to be a combination of
6739𓀴      the two—gaunt,
 savage, and as
 large as a small lioness. Even now
6740𓀴      in the stillness of death,
 the huge jaws seemed to be dripping
6741𓀴      with a bluish flame and the
 small, deep-set, cruel eyes were
6742𓀴      ringed with fire. I placed
 my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and
6743𓀴      as I held them
 up my own fingers
 smouldered and gleamed in the
6744𓀴      darkness.
6745𓀴
6746𓀴      “Phosphorus,” I said.
6747𓀴
6748𓀴      “A cunning
 preparation of it,”
 said Holmes, sniffing at the dead
6749𓀴      animal. “There is no smell
 which might have interfered with his
6750𓀴      power of scent.
 We owe you a
 deep apology, Sir Henry, for having
6751𓀴      exposed you to this fright.
 I was prepared for a hound, but not
6752𓀴      for such a
 creature as this.
 And the fog gave us little time to
6753𓀴      receive him.”
6754𓀴
6755𓀴      “You have saved my life.”
6756𓀴
6757𓀴      “Having first
 endangered it.
 Are you strong enough to stand?”
6758𓀴
6759𓀴      “Give me another
 mouthful of
 that brandy and I shall be ready for
6760𓀴      anything. So!
 Now, if you will
 help me up. What do you propose to
6761𓀴      do?”
6762𓀴
6763𓀴      “To leave you here. You are
 not fit for further adventures
6764𓀴      tonight. If you will wait,
 one or other of us will go back with
6765𓀴      you to the Hall.”
6766𓀴
6767𓀴      He tried to stagger to his
 feet; but he was still ghastly pale
6768𓀴      and trembling
 in every limb.
 We helped him to a rock, where he
6769𓀴      sat shivering with his
 face buried in his hands.
6770𓀴
6771𓀴      “We must leave
 you now,” said
 Holmes. “The rest of our work must
6772𓀴      be done, and
 every moment is
 of importance. We have our case, and
6773𓀴      now we only want our man.
6774𓀴
6775𓀴      “It’s a thousand
 to one against
 our finding him at the house,” he
6776𓀴      continued
 as we retraced our
 steps swiftly down the path. “Those
6777𓀴      shots must have told
 him that the game was up.”
6778𓀴
6779𓀴      “We were some distance off,
 and this fog may have deadened them.”
6780𓀴
6781𓀴      “He followed the hound to
 call him off—of that you may be
6782𓀴      certain. No, no, he’s gone
 by this time! But we’ll search the
6783𓀴      house and make sure.”
6784𓀴
6785𓀴      The front door was open, so
 we rushed in and hurried from room to
6786𓀴      room to the amazement of a
 doddering old manservant, who met us
6787𓀴      in the passage.
 There was no
 light save in the dining-room, but
6788𓀴      Holmes caught up the lamp
 and left no corner of the house
6789𓀴      unexplored.
 No sign could we
 see of the man whom we were chasing.
6790𓀴      On the upper
 floor, however,
 one of the bedroom doors was locked.
6791𓀴
6792𓀴      “There’s someone in here,”
 cried Lestrade. “I can hear a
6793𓀴      movement. Open this door!”
6794𓀴
6795𓀴      A faint moaning
 and rustling
 came from within. Holmes struck the
6796𓀴      door just
 over the lock with
 the flat of his foot and it flew
6797𓀴      open. Pistol in hand, we
 all three rushed into the room.
6798𓀴
6799𓀴      But there
 was no sign within
 it of that desperate and defiant
6800𓀴      villain whom we expected to
 see. Instead we were faced by an
6801𓀴      object so strange
 and so unexpected
 that we stood for a moment
6802𓀴      staring at it in amazement.
6803𓀴
6804𓀴      The room had been fashioned
 into a small museum, and the walls
6805𓀴      were lined by a number of
 glass-topped cases full of that
6806𓀴      collection
 of butterflies and
 moths the formation of which had
6807𓀴      been the relaxation of this
 complex and dangerous man. In the
6808𓀴      centre of this room there
 was an upright beam, which had been
6809𓀴      placed at some period as a
 support for the old worm-eaten baulk
6810𓀴      of timber which spanned the
 roof. To this post a figure was tied,
6811𓀴      so swathed and muffled in
 the sheets which had been used to
6812𓀴      secure it
 that one could not
 for the moment tell whether it was
6813𓀴      that of a
 man or a woman. One
 towel passed round the throat and
6814𓀴      was secured
 at the back of the
 pillar. Another covered the lower
6815𓀴      part of the face, and over
 it two dark eyes—eyes full of grief
6816𓀴      and shame and a dreadful
 questioning—stared
 back at us. In a
6817𓀴      minute we had torn off the
 gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs.
6818𓀴      Stapleton
 sank upon the floor
 in front of us. As her beautiful
6819𓀴      head fell upon her chest I
 saw the clear red weal of a whiplash
6820𓀴      across her neck.
6821𓀴
6822𓀴      “The brute!” cried Holmes.
 “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle!
6823𓀴      Put her in the chair! She
 has fainted from ill-usage and
6824𓀴      exhaustion.”
6825𓀴
6826𓀴      She opened her eyes again.
6827𓀴
6828𓀴      “Is he safe?” she
 asked. “Has he escaped?”
6829𓀴
6830𓀴      “He cannot
 escape us, madam.”
6831𓀴
6832𓀴      “No, no, I did not mean my
 husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”
6833𓀴
6834𓀴      “Yes.”
6835𓀴
6836𓀴      “And the hound?”
6837𓀴
6838𓀴      “It is dead.”
6839𓀴
6840𓀴      She gave a long
 sigh of satisfaction.
6841𓀴
6842𓀴      “Thank God! Thank God! Oh,
 this villain! See how he has treated
6843𓀴      me!” She shot her arms out
 from her sleeves, and we saw with
6844𓀴      horror that they were all
 mottled with bruises. “But this is
6845𓀴      nothing—nothing!
 It is my mind
 and soul that he has tortured and
6846𓀴      defiled. I could endure it
 all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of
6847𓀴      deception,
 everything, as long
 as I could still cling to the hope
6848𓀴      that I had
 his love, but now
 I know that in this also I have been
6849𓀴      his dupe and his tool.” She
 broke into passionate sobbing as she
6850𓀴      spoke.
6851𓀴
6852𓀴      “You bear him no good will,
 madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then
6853𓀴      where we shall find him. If
 you have ever aided him in evil, help
6854𓀴      us now and so atone.”
6855𓀴
6856𓀴      “There is
 but one place where
 he can have fled,” she answered.
6857𓀴      “There is
 an old tin mine on
 an island in the heart of the mire.
6858𓀴      It was there
 that he kept his
 hound and there also he had made
6859𓀴      preparations
 so that he might
 have a refuge. That is where he
6860𓀴      would fly.”
6861𓀴
6862𓀴      The fog-bank lay like white
 wool against the window. Holmes held
6863𓀴      the lamp towards it.
6864𓀴
6865𓀴      “See,” said
 he. “No one could
 find his way into the Grimpen Mire
6866𓀴      tonight.”
6867𓀴
6868𓀴      She laughed and clapped her
 hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed
6869𓀴      with fierce merriment.
6870𓀴
6871𓀴      “He may find
 his way in, but
 never out,” she cried. “How can he
6872𓀴      see the guiding
 wands tonight?
 We planted them together, he and
6873𓀴      I, to mark
 the pathway through
 the mire. Oh, if I could only have
6874𓀴      plucked them
 out today. Then
 indeed you would have had him at
6875𓀴      your mercy!”
6876𓀴
6877𓀴      It was evident
 to us that all
 pursuit was in vain until the fog
6878𓀴      had lifted.
 Meanwhile we left
 Lestrade in possession of the house
6879𓀴      while Holmes
 and I went back
 with the baronet to Baskerville
6880𓀴      Hall. The story
 of the Stapletons
 could no longer be withheld
6881𓀴      from him, but
 he took the blow
 bravely when he learned the truth
6882𓀴      about the woman whom he had
 loved. But the shock of the night’s
6883𓀴      adventures
 had shattered his
 nerves, and before morning he lay
6884𓀴      delirious in
 a high fever under
 the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two
6885𓀴      of them were
 destined to travel
 together round the world before
6886𓀴      Sir Henry had
 become once more
 the hale, hearty man that he had
6887𓀴      been before
 he became master
 of that ill-omened estate.
6888𓀴
6889𓀴      And now I come rapidly to
 the conclusion of this singular
6890𓀴      narrative, in which I have
 tried to make the reader share those
6891𓀴      dark fears
 and vague surmises
 which clouded our lives so long and
6892𓀴      ended in so
 tragic a manner.
 On the morning after the death of
6893𓀴      the hound
 the fog had lifted
 and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton
6894𓀴      to the point where they had
 found a pathway through the bog. It
6895𓀴      helped us to
 realise the horror
 of this woman’s life when we saw
6896𓀴      the eagerness and joy with
 which she laid us on her husband’s
6897𓀴      track. We left her standing
 upon the thin peninsula of firm,
6898𓀴      peaty soil
 which tapered out
 into the widespread bog. From the
6899𓀴      end of it a
 small wand planted
 here and there showed where the
6900𓀴      path zigzagged from tuft
 to tuft of rushes among those
6901𓀴      green-scummed pits and foul
 quagmires which barred the way to the
6902𓀴      stranger. Rank
 reeds and lush,
 slimy water-plants sent an odour
6903𓀴      of decay and
 a heavy miasmatic
 vapour onto our faces, while a
6904𓀴      false step plunged us more
 than once thigh-deep into the dark,
6905𓀴      quivering mire, which shook
 for yards in soft undulations around
6906𓀴      our feet.
 Its tenacious grip
 plucked at our heels as we walked,
6907𓀴      and when we sank into it it
 was as if some malignant hand was
6908𓀴      tugging us down
 into those obscene
 depths, so grim and purposeful
6909𓀴      was the clutch
 in which it held
 us. Once only we saw a trace that
6910𓀴      someone had
 passed that perilous
 way before us. From amid a tuft
6911𓀴      of cotton
 grass which bore it
 up out of the slime some dark thing
6912𓀴      was projecting. Holmes sank
 to his waist as he stepped from the
6913𓀴      path to seize
 it, and had we
 not been there to drag him out he
6914𓀴      could never
 have set his foot
 upon firm land again. He held an
6915𓀴      old black boot
 in the air. “Meyers,
 Toronto,” was printed on the
6916𓀴      leather inside.
6917𓀴
6918𓀴      “It is worth
 a mud bath,” said
 he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s
6919𓀴      missing boot.”
6920𓀴
6921𓀴      “Thrown there by
 Stapleton in his flight.”
6922𓀴
6923𓀴      “Exactly. He retained it in
 his hand after using it to set the
6924𓀴      hound upon
 the track. He fled
 when he knew the game was up, still
6925𓀴      clutching it. And he hurled
 it away at this point of his flight.
6926𓀴      We know at least that
 he came so far in safety.”
6927𓀴
6928𓀴      But more than that we were
 never destined to know, though there
6929𓀴      was much which
 we might surmise.
 There was no chance of finding
6930𓀴      footsteps in the mire, for
 the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon
6931𓀴      them, but as
 we at last reached
 firmer ground beyond the morass
6932𓀴      we all looked eagerly for
 them. But no slightest sign of them
6933𓀴      ever met our
 eyes. If the earth
 told a true story, then Stapleton
6934𓀴      never reached
 that island of
 refuge towards which he struggled
6935𓀴      through the
 fog upon that last
 night. Somewhere in the heart of
6936𓀴      the great
 Grimpen Mire, down
 in the foul slime of the huge morass
6937𓀴      which had sucked him in,
 this cold and cruel-hearted man is
6938𓀴      forever buried.
6939𓀴
6940𓀴      Many traces we found of him
 in the bog-girt island where he had
6941𓀴      hid his savage ally. A huge
 driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled
6942𓀴      with rubbish
 showed the position
 of an abandoned mine. Beside it
6943𓀴      were the crumbling
 remains of
 the cottages of the miners, driven
6944𓀴      away no doubt
 by the foul reek
 of the surrounding swamp. In one
6945𓀴      of these a staple and chain
 with a quantity of gnawed bones
6946𓀴      showed where the animal had
 been confined. A skeleton with a
6947𓀴      tangle of
 brown hair adhering
 to it lay among the _débris_.
6948𓀴
6949𓀴      “A dog!” said Holmes. “By
 Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor
6950𓀴      Mortimer will never see his
 pet again. Well, I do not know that
6951𓀴      this place contains any
 secret which we have not already
6952𓀴      fathomed. He could hide his
 hound, but he could not hush its
6953𓀴      voice, and hence came those
 cries which even in daylight were not
6954𓀴      pleasant to
 hear. On an emergency
 he could keep the hound in the
6955𓀴      out-house
 at Merripit, but it
 was always a risk, and it was only
6956𓀴      on the supreme day, which
 he regarded as the end of all his
6957𓀴      efforts, that
 he dared do it.
 This paste in the tin is no doubt
6958𓀴      the luminous
 mixture with which
 the creature was daubed. It was
6959𓀴      suggested,
 of course, by the
 story of the family hell-hound, and
6960𓀴      by the desire
 to frighten old
 Sir Charles to death. No wonder the
6961𓀴      poor devil of a convict ran
 and screamed, even as our friend did,
6962𓀴      and as we ourselves
 might have
 done, when he saw such a creature
6963𓀴      bounding through
 the darkness
 of the moor upon his track. It was
6964𓀴      a cunning
 device, for, apart
 from the chance of driving your
6965𓀴      victim to his
 death, what peasant
 would venture to inquire too
6966𓀴      closely into
 such a creature
 should he get sight of it, as many
6967𓀴      have done, upon the moor? I
 said it in London, Watson, and I say
6968𓀴      it again now,
 that never yet
 have we helped to hunt down a more
6969𓀴      dangerous
 man than he who is
 lying yonder”—he swept his long arm
6970𓀴      towards the
 huge mottled expanse
 of green-splotched bog which
6971𓀴      stretched away
 until it merged
 into the russet slopes of the
6972𓀴      moor.

6978𓀴A Retrospection
6979𓀴
6980𓀴
6981𓀴      It was the end of November,
 and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and
6982𓀴      foggy night, on either side
 of a blazing fire in our sitting-room
6983𓀴      in Baker Street. Since the
 tragic upshot of our visit to
6984𓀴      Devonshire
 he had been engaged
 in two affairs of the utmost
6985𓀴      importance, in the first of
 which he had exposed the atrocious
6986𓀴      conduct of Colonel Upwood
 in connection with the famous card
6987𓀴      scandal of the Nonpareil
 Club, while in the second he had
6988𓀴      defended the
 unfortunate Mme.
 Montpensier from the charge of
6989𓀴      murder which hung over her
 in connection with the death of her
6990𓀴      step-daughter,
 Mlle. Carére,
 the young lady who, as it will be
6991𓀴      remembered,
 was found six months
 later alive and married in New
6992𓀴      York. My friend
 was in excellent
 spirits over the success which
6993𓀴      had attended
 a succession of
 difficult and important cases, so
6994𓀴      that I was able to induce
 him to discuss the details of the
6995𓀴      Baskerville mystery. I had
 waited patiently for the opportunity
6996𓀴      for I was
 aware that he would
 never permit cases to overlap, and
6997𓀴      that his clear and logical
 mind would not be drawn from its
6998𓀴      present work to dwell upon
 memories of the past. Sir Henry and
6999𓀴      Dr. Mortimer were, however,
 in London, on their way to that long
7000𓀴      voyage which
 had been recommended
 for the restoration of his
7001𓀴      shattered nerves.
 They had called
 upon us that very afternoon, so
7002𓀴      that it was natural that
 the subject should come up for
7003𓀴      discussion.
7004𓀴
7005𓀴      “The whole
 course of events,”
 said Holmes, “from the point of
7006𓀴      view of the man who called
 himself Stapleton was simple and
7007𓀴      direct, although to us, who
 had no means in the beginning of
7008𓀴      knowing the motives of his
 actions and could only learn part of
7009𓀴      the facts, it all appeared
 exceedingly complex. I have had the
7010𓀴      advantage of
 two conversations
 with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case
7011𓀴      has now been
 so entirely cleared
 up that I am not aware that
7012𓀴      there is anything which has
 remained a secret to us. You will
7013𓀴      find a few notes upon the
 matter under the heading B in my
7014𓀴      indexed list of cases.”
7015𓀴
7016𓀴      “Perhaps you would kindly
 give me a sketch of the course of
7017𓀴      events from memory.”
7018𓀴
7019𓀴      “Certainly, though I cannot
 guarantee that I carry all the facts
7020𓀴      in my mind. Intense mental
 concentration has a curious way of
7021𓀴      blotting out
 what has passed.
 The barrister who has his case at
7022𓀴      his fingers’
 ends and is able
 to argue with an expert upon his
7023𓀴      own subject
 finds that a week
 or two of the courts will drive it
7024𓀴      all out of
 his head once more.
 So each of my cases displaces the
7025𓀴      last, and Mlle.
 Carére has blurred
 my recollection of Baskerville
7026𓀴      Hall. Tomorrow
 some other little
 problem may be submitted to my
7027𓀴      notice which will
 in turn dispossess
 the fair French lady and the
7028𓀴      infamous Upwood.
 So far as the
 case of the hound goes, however, I
7029𓀴      will give you the course of
 events as nearly as I can, and you
7030𓀴      will suggest anything
 which I may have forgotten.
7031𓀴
7032𓀴      “My inquiries
 show beyond all
 question that the family portrait
7033𓀴      did not lie, and that this
 fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He
7034𓀴      was a son of that
 Rodger Baskerville,
 the younger brother of Sir
7035𓀴      Charles, who
 fled with a sinister
 reputation to South America,
7036𓀴      where he was
 said to have died
 unmarried. He did, as a matter of
7037𓀴      fact, marry,
 and had one child,
 this fellow, whose real name is
7038𓀴      the same as his father’s.
 He married Beryl Garcia, one of the
7039𓀴      beauties of
 Costa Rica, and,
 having purloined a considerable sum
7040𓀴      of public money, he changed
 his name to Vandeleur and fled to
7041𓀴      England, where
 he established
 a school in the east of Yorkshire.
7042𓀴      His reason
 for attempting this
 special line of business was that
7043𓀴      he had struck
 up an acquaintance
 with a consumptive tutor upon
7044𓀴      the voyage
 home, and that he
 had used this man’s ability to make
7045𓀴      the undertaking a success.
 Fraser, the tutor, died however, and
7046𓀴      the school
 which had begun well
 sank from disrepute into infamy.
7047𓀴      The Vandeleurs
 found it convenient
 to change their name to
7048𓀴      Stapleton,
 and he brought the
 remains of his fortune, his schemes
7049𓀴      for the future,
 and his taste
 for entomology to the south of
7050𓀴      England. I learned
 at the British
 Museum that he was a recognized
7051𓀴      authority upon the subject,
 and that the name of Vandeleur has
7052𓀴      been permanently
 attached to
 a certain moth which he had, in his
7053𓀴      Yorkshire days, been
 the first to describe.
7054𓀴
7055𓀴      “We now come
 to that portion
 of his life which has proved to be
7056𓀴      of such intense interest to
 us. The fellow had evidently made
7057𓀴      inquiry and found that only
 two lives intervened between him and
7058𓀴      a valuable estate. When he
 went to Devonshire his plans were, I
7059𓀴      believe, exceedingly hazy,
 but that he meant mischief from the
7060𓀴      first is evident
 from the way
 in which he took his wife with him
7061𓀴      in the character
 of his sister.
 The idea of using her as a decoy
7062𓀴      was clearly already in his
 mind, though he may not have been
7063𓀴      certain how
 the details of his
 plot were to be arranged. He meant
7064𓀴      in the end
 to have the estate,
 and he was ready to use any tool
7065𓀴      or run any
 risk for that end.
 His first act was to establish
7066𓀴      himself as near
 to his ancestral
 home as he could, and his second
7067𓀴      was to cultivate
 a friendship
 with Sir Charles Baskerville and
7068𓀴      with the neighbours.
7069𓀴
7070𓀴      “The baronet himself told
 him about the family hound, and so
7071𓀴      prepared the
 way for his own
 death. Stapleton, as I will continue
7072𓀴      to call him, knew that the
 old man’s heart was weak and that a
7073𓀴      shock would
 kill him. So much
 he had learned from Dr. Mortimer.
7074𓀴      He had heard also that Sir
 Charles was superstitious and had
7075𓀴      taken this grim legend very
 seriously. His ingenious mind
7076𓀴      instantly
 suggested a way by
 which the baronet could be done to
7077𓀴      death, and yet it would be
 hardly possible to bring home the
7078𓀴      guilt to the real murderer.
7079𓀴
7080𓀴      “Having conceived the idea
 he proceeded to carry it out with
7081𓀴      considerable
 finesse. An ordinary
 schemer would have been content
7082𓀴      to work with
 a savage hound.
 The use of artificial means to make
7083𓀴      the creature diabolical was
 a flash of genius upon his part. The
7084𓀴      dog he bought
 in London from
 Ross and Mangles, the dealers in
7085𓀴      Fulham Road.
 It was the strongest
 and most savage in their
7086𓀴      possession.
 He brought it down
 by the North Devon line and walked
7087𓀴      a great distance over the
 moor so as to get it home without
7088𓀴      exciting any
 remarks. He had
 already on his insect hunts learned
7089𓀴      to penetrate the Grimpen
 Mire, and so had found a safe
7090𓀴      hiding-place
 for the creature.
 Here he kennelled it and waited
7091𓀴      his chance.
7092𓀴
7093𓀴      “But it was
 some time coming.
 The old gentleman could not be
7094𓀴      decoyed outside
 of his grounds
 at night. Several times Stapleton
7095𓀴      lurked about
 with his hound,
 but without avail. It was during
7096𓀴      these fruitless quests that
 he, or rather his ally, was seen by
7097𓀴      peasants,
 and that the legend
 of the demon dog received a new
7098𓀴      confirmation. He had hoped
 that his wife might lure Sir Charles
7099𓀴      to his ruin,
 but here she proved
 unexpectedly independent. She
7100𓀴      would not endeavour to
 entangle the old gentleman in a
7101𓀴      sentimental
 attachment which
 might deliver him over to his enemy.
7102𓀴      Threats and
 even, I am sorry
 to say, blows refused to move her.
7103𓀴      She would
 have nothing to do
 with it, and for a time Stapleton
7104𓀴      was at a deadlock.
7105𓀴
7106𓀴      “He found a way out of his
 difficulties through the chance that
7107𓀴      Sir Charles,
 who had conceived
 a friendship for him, made him the
7108𓀴      minister of his charity in
 the case of this unfortunate woman,
7109𓀴      Mrs. Laura Lyons.
 By representing
 himself as a single man he
7110𓀴      acquired complete influence
 over her, and he gave her to
7111𓀴      understand
 that in the event
 of her obtaining a divorce from her
7112𓀴      husband he would marry her.
 His plans were suddenly brought to a
7113𓀴      head by his knowledge that
 Sir Charles was about to leave the
7114𓀴      Hall on the advice
 of Dr. Mortimer,
 with whose opinion he himself
7115𓀴      pretended to
 coincide. He must
 act at once, or his victim might
7116𓀴      get beyond his
 power. He therefore
 put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons
7117𓀴      to write this
 letter, imploring
 the old man to give her an
7118𓀴      interview on
 the evening before
 his departure for London. He
7119𓀴      then, by a
 specious argument,
 prevented her from going, and so
7120𓀴      had the chance
 for which he had waited.
7121𓀴
7122𓀴      “Driving back
 in the evening
 from Coombe Tracey he was in time to
7123𓀴      get his hound,
 to treat it with
 his infernal paint, and to bring
7124𓀴      the beast round to the gate
 at which he had reason to expect that
7125𓀴      he would find
 the old gentleman
 waiting. The dog, incited by its
7126𓀴      master, sprang
 over the wicket-gate
 and pursued the unfortunate
7127𓀴      baronet, who fled screaming
 down the yew alley. In that gloomy
7128𓀴      tunnel it must
 indeed have been
 a dreadful sight to see that huge
7129𓀴      black creature,
 with its flaming
 jaws and blazing eyes, bounding
7130𓀴      after its victim.
 He fell dead
 at the end of the alley from heart
7131𓀴      disease and
 terror. The hound
 had kept upon the grassy border
7132𓀴      while the baronet
 had run down
 the path, so that no track but the
7133𓀴      man’s was
 visible. On seeing
 him lying still the creature had
7134𓀴      probably approached
 to sniff
 at him, but finding him dead had
7135𓀴      turned away
 again. It was then
 that it left the print which was
7136𓀴      actually observed
 by Dr. Mortimer.
 The hound was called off and
7137𓀴      hurried away to its lair in
 the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was
7138𓀴      left which puzzled
 the authorities,
 alarmed the countryside, and
7139𓀴      finally brought
 the case within
 the scope of our observation.
7140𓀴
7141𓀴      “So much for
 the death of Sir
 Charles Baskerville. You perceive
7142𓀴      the devilish cunning of
 it, for really it would be almost
7143𓀴      impossible to make a case
 against the real murderer. His only
7144𓀴      accomplice
 was one who could
 never give him away, and the
7145𓀴      grotesque,
 inconceivable nature
 of the device only served to make
7146𓀴      it more effective.
 Both of the
 women concerned in the case, Mrs.
7147𓀴      Stapleton and
 Mrs. Laura Lyons,
 were left with a strong suspicion
7148𓀴      against Stapleton.
 Mrs. Stapleton
 knew that he had designs upon
7149𓀴      the old man,
 and also of the
 existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons
7150𓀴      knew neither
 of these things,
 but had been impressed by the death
7151𓀴      occurring at the time of an
 uncancelled appointment which was
7152𓀴      only known to him. However,
 both of them were under his
7153𓀴      influence,
 and he had nothing
 to fear from them. The first half
7154𓀴      of his task
 was successfully
 accomplished but the more difficult
7155𓀴      still remained.
7156𓀴
7157𓀴      “It is possible
 that Stapleton
 did not know of the existence of
7158𓀴      an heir in
 Canada. In any case
 he would very soon learn it from
7159𓀴      his friend Dr. Mortimer,
 and he was told by the latter all
7160𓀴      details about
 the arrival of
 Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first
7161𓀴      idea was that
 this young stranger
 from Canada might possibly be
7162𓀴      done to death
 in London without
 coming down to Devonshire at all.
7163𓀴      He distrusted his wife ever
 since she had refused to help him in
7164𓀴      laying a trap
 for the old man,
 and he dared not leave her long
7165𓀴      out of his
 sight for fear he
 should lose his influence over her.
7166𓀴      It was for this reason that
 he took her to London with him. They
7167𓀴      lodged, I find,
 at the Mexborough
 Private Hotel, in Craven
7168𓀴      Street, which was actually
 one of those called upon by my agent
7169𓀴      in search of evidence. Here
 he kept his wife imprisoned in her
7170𓀴      room while he, disguised in
 a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to
7171𓀴      Baker Street and afterwards
 to the station and to the
7172𓀴      Northumberland
 Hotel. His wife
 had some inkling of his plans; but
7173𓀴      she had such a fear of her
 husband—a fear founded upon brutal
7174𓀴      ill-treatment—that she dare
 not write to warn the man whom she
7175𓀴      knew to be
 in danger. If the
 letter should fall into Stapleton’s
7176𓀴      hands her
 own life would not
 be safe. Eventually, as we know, she
7177𓀴      adopted the
 expedient of cutting
 out the words which would form
7178𓀴      the message, and addressing
 the letter in a disguised hand. It
7179𓀴      reached the baronet, and
 gave him the first warning of his
7180𓀴      danger.
7181𓀴
7182𓀴      “It was very essential for
 Stapleton to get some article of Sir
7183𓀴      Henry’s attire
 so that, in case
 he was driven to use the dog, he
7184𓀴      might always have the means
 of setting him upon his track. With
7185𓀴      characteristic
 promptness and
 audacity he set about this at once,
7186𓀴      and we cannot
 doubt that the
 boots or chamber-maid of the hotel
7187𓀴      was well bribed to help him
 in his design. By chance, however,
7188𓀴      the first boot
 which was procured
 for him was a new one and,
7189𓀴      therefore, useless for his
 purpose. He then had it returned and
7190𓀴      obtained another—a
 most instructive
 incident, since it proved
7191𓀴      conclusively
 to my mind that
 we were dealing with a real hound,
7192𓀴      as no other
 supposition could
 explain this anxiety to obtain an
7193𓀴      old boot and
 this indifference
 to a new one. The more _outré_ and
7194𓀴      grotesque
 an incident is the
 more carefully it deserves to be
7195𓀴      examined,
 and the very point
 which appears to complicate a case
7196𓀴      is, when duly
 considered and
 scientifically handled, the one
7197𓀴      which is most
 likely to elucidate it.
7198𓀴
7199𓀴      “Then we had the visit from
 our friends next morning, shadowed
7200𓀴      always by Stapleton in the
 cab. From his knowledge of our rooms
7201𓀴      and of my
 appearance, as well
 as from his general conduct, I am
7202𓀴      inclined to think
 that Stapleton’s
 career of crime has been by no
7203𓀴      means limited
 to this single
 Baskerville affair. It is suggestive
7204𓀴      that during the last three
 years there have been four
7205𓀴      considerable burglaries in
 the west country, for none of which
7206𓀴      was any criminal
 ever arrested.
 The last of these, at Folkestone
7207𓀴      Court, in
 May, was remarkable
 for the cold-blooded pistolling of
7208𓀴      the page, who surprised the
 masked and solitary burglar. I cannot
7209𓀴      doubt that
 Stapleton recruited
 his waning resources in this
7210𓀴      fashion, and that for years
 he has been a desperate and dangerous
7211𓀴      man.
7212𓀴
7213𓀴      “We had an example
 of his readiness
 of resource that morning when
7214𓀴      he got away from
 us so successfully,
 and also of his audacity in
7215𓀴      sending back my own name to
 me through the cabman. From that
7216𓀴      moment he understood that I
 had taken over the case in London,
7217𓀴      and that therefore
 there was
 no chance for him there. He returned
7218𓀴      to Dartmoor and awaited
 the arrival of the baronet.”
7219𓀴
7220𓀴      “One moment!”
 said I. “You have,
 no doubt, described the sequence
7221𓀴      of events correctly,
 but there
 is one point which you have left
7222𓀴      unexplained. What became of
 the hound when its master was in
7223𓀴      London?”
7224𓀴
7225𓀴      “I have given
 some attention
 to this matter and it is undoubtedly
7226𓀴      of importance. There can be
 no question that Stapleton had a
7227𓀴      confidant, though
 it is unlikely
 that he ever placed himself in
7228𓀴      his power
 by sharing all his
 plans with him. There was an old
7229𓀴      manservant
 at Merripit House,
 whose name was Anthony. His
7230𓀴      connection
 with the Stapletons
 can be traced for several years,
7231𓀴      as far back as
 the school-mastering
 days, so that he must have
7232𓀴      been aware that his master
 and mistress were really husband and
7233𓀴      wife. This
 man has disappeared
 and has escaped from the country.
7234𓀴      It is suggestive
 that Anthony
 is not a common name in England,
7235𓀴      while Antonio
 is so in all Spanish
 or Spanish-American countries.
7236𓀴      The man, like
 Mrs. Stapleton
 herself, spoke good English, but
7237𓀴      with a curious
 lisping accent.
 I have myself seen this old man
7238𓀴      cross the Grimpen Mire by
 the path which Stapleton had marked
7239𓀴      out. It is very
 probable, therefore,
 that in the absence of his
7240𓀴      master it was he who cared
 for the hound, though he may never
7241𓀴      have known the purpose
 for which the beast was used.
7242𓀴
7243𓀴      “The Stapletons
 then went down
 to Devonshire, whither they were
7244𓀴      soon followed by Sir Henry
 and you. One word now as to how I
7245𓀴      stood myself at that time.
 It may possibly recur to your memory
7246𓀴      that when I
 examined the paper
 upon which the printed words were
7247𓀴      fastened I made
 a close inspection
 for the water-mark. In doing
7248𓀴      so I held it
 within a few inches
 of my eyes, and was conscious of
7249𓀴      a faint smell of the scent
 known as white jessamine. There are
7250𓀴      seventy-five
 perfumes, which
 it is very necessary that a criminal
7251𓀴      expert should
 be able to distinguish
 from each other, and cases
7252𓀴      have more
 than once within my
 own experience depended upon their
7253𓀴      prompt recognition.
 The scent
 suggested the presence of a lady,
7254𓀴      and already
 my thoughts began
 to turn towards the Stapletons.
7255𓀴      Thus I had made certain of
 the hound, and had guessed at the
7256𓀴      criminal before ever
 we went to the west country.
7257𓀴
7258𓀴      “It was my game
 to watch Stapleton.
 It was evident, however, that
7259𓀴      I could not
 do this if I were
 with you, since he would be keenly
7260𓀴      on his guard.
 I deceived everybody,
 therefore, yourself included,
7261𓀴      and I came
 down secretly when
 I was supposed to be in London. My
7262𓀴      hardships were not so great
 as you imagined, though such trifling
7263𓀴      details must
 never interfere
 with the investigation of a case. I
7264𓀴      stayed for the most part at
 Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut
7265𓀴      upon the moor when it was
 necessary to be near the scene of
7266𓀴      action. Cartwright had come
 down with me, and in his disguise as
7267𓀴      a country
 boy he was of great
 assistance to me. I was dependent
7268𓀴      upon him for food and clean
 linen. When I was watching Stapleton,
7269𓀴      Cartwright was frequently
 watching you, so that I was able to
7270𓀴      keep my hand
 upon all the strings.
7271𓀴
7272𓀴      “I have already
 told you that
 your reports reached me rapidly,
7273𓀴      being forwarded instantly
 from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.
7274𓀴      They were of great service
 to me, and especially that one
7275𓀴      incidentally truthful piece
 of biography of Stapleton’s. I was
7276𓀴      able to establish
 the identity
 of the man and the woman and knew
7277𓀴      at last exactly
 how I stood.
 The case had been considerably
7278𓀴      complicated
 through the incident
 of the escaped convict and the
7279𓀴      relations
 between him and the
 Barrymores. This also you cleared
7280𓀴      up in a very effective way,
 though I had already come to the same
7281𓀴      conclusions from
 my own observations.
7282𓀴
7283𓀴      “By the time
 that you discovered
 me upon the moor I had a
7284𓀴      complete knowledge
 of the whole
 business, but I had not a case
7285𓀴      which could
 go to a jury. Even
 Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry
7286𓀴      that night
 which ended in the
 death of the unfortunate convict
7287𓀴      did not help
 us much in proving
 murder against our man. There
7288𓀴      seemed to be no alternative
 but to catch him red-handed, and to
7289𓀴      do so we had
 to use Sir Henry,
 alone and apparently unprotected,
7290𓀴      as a bait.
 We did so, and at
 the cost of a severe shock to our
7291𓀴      client we succeeded
 in completing
 our case and driving Stapleton
7292𓀴      to his destruction.
 That Sir
 Henry should have been exposed to
7293𓀴      this is, I must
 confess, a reproach
 to my management of the case,
7294𓀴      but we had no
 means of foreseeing
 the terrible and paralyzing
7295𓀴      spectacle which
 the beast presented,
 nor could we predict the fog
7296𓀴      which enabled him to burst
 upon us at such short notice. We
7297𓀴      succeeded in our object at
 a cost which both the specialist and
7298𓀴      Dr. Mortimer assure me will
 be a temporary one. A long journey
7299𓀴      may enable our
 friend to recover
 not only from his shattered
7300𓀴      nerves but also
 from his wounded
 feelings. His love for the lady
7301𓀴      was deep and sincere, and
 to him the saddest part of all this
7302𓀴      black business was that he
 should have been deceived by her.
7303𓀴
7304𓀴      “It only remains
 to indicate
 the part which she had played
7305𓀴      throughout. There can be no
 doubt that Stapleton exercised an
7306𓀴      influence
 over her which may
 have been love or may have been
7307𓀴      fear, or very possibly
 both, since they are by no means
7308𓀴      incompatible
 emotions. It was,
 at least, absolutely effective. At
7309𓀴      his command
 she consented to
 pass as his sister, though he found
7310𓀴      the limits
 of his power over
 her when he endeavoured to make her
7311𓀴      the direct
 accessory to murder.
 She was ready to warn Sir Henry
7312𓀴      so far as she could without
 implicating her husband, and again
7313𓀴      and again she tried to do
 so. Stapleton himself seems to have
7314𓀴      been capable of jealousy,
 and when he saw the baronet paying
7315𓀴      court to the
 lady, even though
 it was part of his own plan, still
7316𓀴      he could not
 help interrupting
 with a passionate outburst which
7317𓀴      revealed the
 fiery soul which
 his self-contained manner so
7318𓀴      cleverly concealed.
 By encouraging
 the intimacy he made it
7319𓀴      certain that
 Sir Henry would
 frequently come to Merripit House
7320𓀴      and that he would sooner or
 later get the opportunity which he
7321𓀴      desired. On the day of the
 crisis, however, his wife turned
7322𓀴      suddenly against
 him. She had
 learned something of the death of
7323𓀴      the convict,
 and she knew that
 the hound was being kept in the
7324𓀴      outhouse on
 the evening that
 Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She
7325𓀴      taxed her husband with his
 intended crime, and a furious scene
7326𓀴      followed in which he showed
 her for the first time that she had a
7327𓀴      rival in his
 love. Her fidelity
 turned in an instant to bitter
7328𓀴      hatred, and he saw that she
 would betray him. He tied her up,
7329𓀴      therefore,
 that she might have
 no chance of warning Sir Henry,
7330𓀴      and he hoped,
 no doubt, that
 when the whole countryside put down
7331𓀴      the baronet’s
 death to the curse
 of his family, as they certainly
7332𓀴      would do, he could win his
 wife back to accept an accomplished
7333𓀴      fact and to
 keep silent upon
 what she knew. In this I fancy that
7334𓀴      in any case he
 made a miscalculation,
 and that, if we had not
7335𓀴      been there, his doom would
 none the less have been sealed. A
7336𓀴      woman of Spanish blood does
 not condone such an injury so
7337𓀴      lightly. And
 now, my dear Watson,
 without referring to my notes,
7338𓀴      I cannot give
 you a more detailed
 account of this curious case. I
7339𓀴      do not know that
 anything essential
 has been left unexplained.”
7340𓀴
7341𓀴      “He could not
 hope to frighten
 Sir Henry to death as he had done
7342𓀴      the old uncle
 with his bogie hound.”
7343𓀴
7344𓀴      “The beast was
 savage and half-starved.
 If its appearance did not
7345𓀴      frighten its
 victim to death,
 at least it would paralyze the
7346𓀴      resistance which
 might be offered.”
7347𓀴
7348𓀴      “No doubt.
 There only remains
 one difficulty. If Stapleton came
7349𓀴      into the succession,
 how could
 he explain the fact that he, the
7350𓀴      heir, had been
 living unannounced
 under another name so close to
7351𓀴      the property?
 How could he claim
 it without causing suspicion and
7352𓀴      inquiry?”
7353𓀴
7354𓀴      “It is a formidable
 difficulty,
 and I fear that you ask too much
7355𓀴      when you expect me to solve
 it. The past and the present are
7356𓀴      within the
 field of my inquiry,
 but what a man may do in the
7357𓀴      future is
 a hard question to
 answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her
7358𓀴      husband discuss the problem
 on several occasions. There were
7359𓀴      three possible courses. He
 might claim the property from South
7360𓀴      America, establish
 his identity
 before the British authorities
7361𓀴      there and so
 obtain the fortune
 without ever coming to England at
7362𓀴      all, or he might adopt an
 elaborate disguise during the short
7363𓀴      time that he
 need be in London;
 or, again, he might furnish an
7364𓀴      accomplice with the proofs
 and papers, putting him in as heir,
7365𓀴      and retaining a claim upon
 some proportion of his income. We
7366𓀴      cannot doubt
 from what we know
 of him that he would have found
7367𓀴      some way out
 of the difficulty.
 And now, my dear Watson, we have
7368𓀴      had some weeks
 of severe work,
 and for one evening, I think, we
7369𓀴      may turn our thoughts into
 more pleasant channels. I have a box
7370𓀴      for _Les Huguenots_. Have
 you heard the De Reszkes? Might I
7371𓀴      trouble you
 then to be ready
 in half an hour, and we can stop at
7372𓀴      Marcini’s for a little
 dinner on the way?”

7652𓀴assistance they need are critical
 to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
7653𓀴goals and ensuring
 that the Project
 Gutenberg™ collection will
7654𓀴remain freely available
 for generations
 to come. In 2001, the Project
7655𓀴Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation
 was created to provide a secure
7656𓀴and permanent future for Project
 Gutenberg™ and future
7657𓀴generations. To learn more about
 the Project Gutenberg Literary
7658𓀴Archive Foundation and how your

 about Donations
 to the Project Gutenberg
7677𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
7678𓀴
7679𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 depends upon and
 cannot survive without widespread
7680𓀴public support and donations
 to carry out its mission of
7681𓀴increasing the number
 of public domain
 and licensed works that can be
7682𓀴freely distributed
 in machine-readable
 form accessible by the widest
7683𓀴array of equipment
 including outdated
 equipment. Many small donations
7684𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly
 important to maintaining tax exempt
7685𓀴status with the IRS.
7686𓀴
7687𓀴The Foundation is committed to
 complying with the laws regulating
7688𓀴charities and charitable
 donations
 in all 50 states of the United
7689𓀴States. Compliance requirements
 are not uniform and it takes a
7690𓀴considerable effort,
 much paperwork
 and many fees to meet and keep up
7691𓀴with these requirements. We do
 not solicit donations in locations
7692𓀴where we have not
 received written
 confirmation of compliance. To SEND
7693𓀴DONATIONS or determine
 the status of
 compliance for any particular state
7694𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
7695𓀴
7696𓀴While we cannot
 and do not solicit
 contributions from states where we
7697𓀴have not met the solicitation
 requirements,
 we know of no prohibition
7698𓀴against accepting
 unsolicited donations
 from donors in such states who
7699𓀴approach us with
 offers to donate.
7700𓀴
7701𓀴International donations
 are gratefully
 accepted, but we cannot make
7702𓀴any statements concerning
 tax treatment
 of donations received from
7703𓀴outside the United States. U.S.
 laws alone swamp our small staff.
7704𓀴
7705𓀴Please check the
 Project Gutenberg
 web pages for current donation
7706𓀴methods and addresses. Donations
 are accepted in a number of other
7707𓀴ways including checks,
 online payments
 and credit card donations. To

 Information About
 Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
7711𓀴
7712𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was
 the originator of the Project
7713𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library
 of electronic works that could be
7714𓀴freely shared with anyone. For
 forty years, he produced and
7715𓀴distributed Project
 Gutenberg™ eBooks
 with only a loose network of
7716𓀴volunteer support.
7717𓀴
7718𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 eBooks are often
 created from several printed
7719𓀴editions, all of
 which are confirmed
 as not protected by copyright in
7720𓀴the U.S. unless
 a copyright notice
 is included. Thus, we do not
7721𓀴necessarily keep
 eBooks in compliance
 with any particular paper
7722𓀴edition.
