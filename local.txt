33𓀴
34𓀴    This remarkable story, made
 so principally by the fact
35𓀴    that radio enters into it,
 is one of the most ingenious
36𓀴    we have ever read. The best
 part about the story, however,
37𓀴    is that the radio principles
 throughout the story are quite
38𓀴    accurate. There is nothing
 fantastic about it, and the
39𓀴    thing can be duplicated
 by any good radio man today.
40𓀴
41𓀴    Here, then, is a scientifiction
 story, thrilling,
42𓀴    mysterious, and breathtaking,
 that we know you will enjoy.
43𓀴
44𓀴
45𓀴[Illustration: “...As I bent over
 to examine the spot, I heard a cry
46𓀴of warning from the
 girl and a quick
 movement behind me. I turned,
47𓀴but could not move in time to avoid
 the heavy chair which was rushing
48𓀴toward me. It knocked me over and
 came back, apparently bent on my
49𓀴destruction.”]
50𓀴
51𓀴
52𓀴Dr. Dorp looked up
 in annoyance when
 Mrs. Bream came into the room. As
53𓀴was my weekly custom, I had dropped
 into his study for a short Saturday
54𓀴afternoon’s visit, and the talk had
 turned to our mutual hobby, psychic
55𓀴phenomena. The learned doctor’s
 look of vexation had followed the
56𓀴unobtrusive entrance
 of his housekeeper
 during a somewhat heated
57𓀴discussion of that
 physically elusive
 but psychologically evident
58𓀴substance which has come
 to be known as ectoplasm.
59𓀴
60𓀴“What is it, Mrs. Bream?”
 he asked, petulantly.
61𓀴
62𓀴“Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but
 there’s a young lady to see you.”
63𓀴
64𓀴“What is she selling?”
65𓀴
66𓀴“I believe she wants to consult
 you professionally, sir.”
67𓀴
68𓀴“Like the book agent
 who called Wednesday,
 I suppose. Wanted my opinion
69𓀴of the twelve volumes
 he was peddling.
 Well, show her in. We’ll soon
70𓀴see.”
71𓀴
72𓀴I rose to leave the room, but
 the doctor raised his hand.
73𓀴
74𓀴“Keep your seat, Evans,”
 he said. “I
 don’t expect this interview to be
75𓀴either important or protracted.”
76𓀴
77𓀴I resumed my seat, but
 rose again immediately
 as a neatly dressed girl
78𓀴entered the room. She was
 small, golden-haired,
 and quite pretty. For a
79𓀴moment she glanced at both of us,
 standing beside our chairs--then
80𓀴evidently decided in favor of
 the doctor’s grizzled Van Dyke.
81𓀴
82𓀴“I am Greta Van Loan, doctor,” she
 said, addressing him as if sure she
83𓀴had spoken to the right man.
84𓀴
85𓀴“You recognize me, then?” he asked,
 drawing a chair forward for her.
86𓀴
87𓀴She sat down lightly, and
 with exquisite grace.
88𓀴
89𓀴“To be sure. I have
 seen your picture
 in the papers ever so many times,
90𓀴usually in connection with your
 investigations of spiritistic
91𓀴phenomena.”
92𓀴
93𓀴The doctor did not appear to feel
 flattered. In fact, his look was
94𓀴rather one of boredom,
 as if he expected
 something unpleasant to grow
95𓀴out of this subtle
 blandishment. His
 voice, however, was quite pleasant
96𓀴as he replied.
97𓀴
98𓀴“Indeed. Will you tell me how
 I may be of service to you?”
99𓀴
100𓀴She looked at me, and I developed
 a most unnecessary feeling. I rose
101𓀴once more, this time
 firmly resolved
 to take my leave, but again the
102𓀴doctor detained me.
103𓀴
104𓀴“Miss Van Loan,”
 he said, “allow me
 to present Mr. Evans, my friend and
105𓀴colleague. Like me,
 he is an investigator
 of the supernormal in psychic
106𓀴phenomena.”
107𓀴
108𓀴Her acknowledgment
 of the introduction
 was accompanied by a charming
109𓀴smile that immediately
 put me at my ease.
110𓀴
111𓀴“I have heard of your
 work in connection
 with that of Dr. Dorp,” she
112𓀴said. “How fortunate that I find
 you two together--especially as my
113𓀴reason for coming
 to see the doctor
 has a direct bearing on the very
114𓀴subject that seems
 to be of interest
 to both of you. Won’t you stay?”
115𓀴
116𓀴I relapsed once more
 into my chair.
117𓀴
118𓀴The doctor, I observed,
 had pricked
 up his ears like a hound on a hot
119𓀴trail. He leaned forward in his
 chair and pressed the tips of his
120𓀴fingers together--an attitude he
 always assumed when absorbed in a
121𓀴problem that was of intense
 interest to him.
122𓀴
123𓀴“Miss Van Loan,”
 he began, “you are
 not by any chance a relative of my
124𓀴old friend and fellow worker,
 Gordon Van Loan?”
125𓀴
126𓀴“I am his niece.”
127𓀴
128𓀴“Indeed. I begin
 to understand your
 interest in spiritistic phenomena.
129𓀴Dense of me not to have
 thought of it before.”
130𓀴
131𓀴“But, doctor, I am not interested
 in spiritistic phenomena.”
132𓀴
133𓀴“Eh? Not interested?
 I’m afraid I don’t--”
134𓀴
135𓀴“I have always feared and detested
 the very thought of meeting or
136𓀴communicating with the
 disembodied spirits.”
137𓀴
138𓀴“Really, Miss Van
 Loan, you surprise
 me,” said the doctor. “Your uncle,
139𓀴up to the very time of his death,
 was an ardent supporter of the
140𓀴spiritistic hypothesis. I have had
 many a private debate with him on the
141𓀴subject.”
142𓀴
143𓀴“I am aware of that. I, too, have
 argued the subject with him when it
144𓀴was forced on me. Until three days
 ago I was as firm an unbeliever as
145𓀴you. But now--I don’t know what to
 think. It seems that my uncle, even
146𓀴in death, has resolved to
 force his belief upon me.”
147𓀴
148𓀴“You mean that he has
 appeared to you?”
149𓀴
150𓀴“I’m not sure, but strange
 things--terrible,
 enervating things--have
151𓀴happened since I
 began to carry out
 the provisions of my uncle’s will.”
152𓀴
153𓀴“He left his entire fortune
 to you, did he not?”
154𓀴
155𓀴“Yes, but with a provision which I
 am afraid I won’t be able to carry
156𓀴out. He stipulated
 that I must live
 in his old home in Highland Park
157𓀴continuously for
 one year, and that
 if I should fail to do so everything
158𓀴would revert to my
 cousin, Ernest Hegel,
 or in the event of his failure
159𓀴to carry out the provision, to the
 Society for Psychical Research.”
160𓀴
161𓀴“Your uncle was reputed
 to be quite wealthy.”
162𓀴
163𓀴“He left something
 over half a million,
 most of which was in first
164𓀴mortgage real estate
 bonds, in addition
 to the home and estate, which is
165𓀴estimated to be worth at
 least a hundred thousand.”
166𓀴
167𓀴“Quite a sizeable bequest, and, it
 seems to me, an ample recompense for
168𓀴the condition imposed with it.”
169𓀴
170𓀴“So I thought too, until I spent
 a night in that awful house. It was
171𓀴then that I began
 to realize the full
 import of his explanation of the
172𓀴reasons for his unusual
 provision.”
173𓀴
174𓀴“Just what was his explanation?”
175𓀴
176𓀴“I can give you his
 exact words. In
 the last three days they have burned
177𓀴themselves into my
 very soul. He said:
 ‘--for when I return to prove the
178𓀴reality of life after
 death it is not
 unreasonable to ask the person who
179𓀴benefits so materially
 by this will
 to be on hand to greet me, and to
180𓀴receive and transmit my message of
 hope and good cheer to the misguided
181𓀴scoffers, who, by
 their very attitude,
 prevent their departed loved ones
182𓀴from communicating with them.’”
183𓀴
184𓀴“Hem. And have you
 received the message,
 or something purporting to be
185𓀴the message?”
186𓀴
187𓀴“Not exactly, but there
 have been indications
 of a strange and terrible
188𓀴presence in that
 house--an elusive,
 disembodied entity that, while not a
189𓀴creature of flesh
 and blood, exercises
 an uncanny power over material
190𓀴objects as well as
 living creatures.”
191𓀴
192𓀴“I see. And the manifestations?”
193𓀴
194𓀴“Ghostly raps, shuffling footsteps
 in rooms that are untenanted,
195𓀴overturned furniture and broken
 china, strange sickening odors
196𓀴suggestive of the dank mustiness
 of the tomb, lights darkened and
197𓀴suddenly lighted again
 with no evidence
 of switches or of fuses having
198𓀴been tampered with,
 the touch of cold
 hands in the dark, doors opening
199𓀴and closing in the dead of
 night, the icy breath--”
200𓀴
201𓀴“The icy breath? What is that?”
202𓀴
203𓀴“It is the most convincing
 evidence
 of my uncle’s presence in the house.
204𓀴Although the last three
 days and nights
 have been exceptionally warm,
205𓀴even for August,
 I have felt it, and
 the servants have felt it--a moving
206𓀴current of air with
 a dank, charnel
 odor, as cold as a wind from the
207𓀴ice-bound Arctic
 circle. As you are
 no doubt aware, my uncle was an
208𓀴ardent admirer of
 the famous Italian
 medium, Eusapia Palladino. One of
209𓀴the most baffling
 manifestations which
 she is said to have produced time
210𓀴and again in the presence
 of investigating
 scientists, was the icy
211𓀴breath--a cold breeze
 that appeared
 to come from her forehead when she
212𓀴was in a trance. Many scoffed, but
 none could explain this remarkable
213𓀴phenomenon. My uncle
 often referred
 to it in his lectures. He has
214𓀴written several papers regarding
 it for spiritistic publications.”
215𓀴
216𓀴“And living creatures, you
 say, have been affected?”
217𓀴
218𓀴“Yes, Sandy, my Airedale
 terrier, has
 not been himself since he entered
219𓀴the house. He has
 bristled and growled
 repeatedly, for no apparent
220𓀴reason. Although
 he has always been
 a most friendly and playful pet, he
221𓀴now slinks about
 the house like some
 vicious creature of the jungle, or
222𓀴mopes in corners,
 avoiding all human
 companionship and barely tasting
223𓀴food and water. This
 morning he snapped
 at my hand when I attempted to
224𓀴pat his head--something
 he has never
 done before. The servants, too,
225𓀴have seen, heard,
 and felt the things
 that have affected me, but being
226𓀴spiritualists, they glory in them
 rather than fear them. Man and wife
227𓀴they have worked for
 my uncle for the
 past ten years, the man acting as
228𓀴gardener, chauffeur
 and butler, the
 woman as cook and housekeeper.”
229𓀴
230𓀴“And your cousin, Ernest Hegel.
 Is he, too, stopping with you at
231𓀴present?”
232𓀴
233𓀴“No. Cousin Ernest
 sailed for Germany
 last Saturday. He is American
234𓀴representative for
 a Berlin dye and
 chemical manufacturer, and was sent
235𓀴for by his concern.”
236𓀴
237𓀴“Then he is a German citizen?”
238𓀴
239𓀴“His father was German, but he was
 born in America, hence he is an
240𓀴American citizen. His mother, like
 my father and Uncle Gordon, was
241𓀴American, of Holland
 Dutch descent.
 Part of his education was received
242𓀴at Heidelberg, and he
 took a postgraduate
 course in chemistry and
243𓀴bacteriology in Vienna. When the
 war broke out, his sympathy for the
244𓀴land of his father was what
 turned my uncle against him.”
245𓀴
246𓀴“And consequently made
 you the preferred heir?”
247𓀴
248𓀴“I think that has something to do
 with it, although I disagreed as
249𓀴thoroughly with Uncle
 Gordon in his
 pet hobby, spiritism, as Ernest did
250𓀴on questions of our international
 relations.”
251𓀴
252𓀴“Do any of the manifestations you
 speak of occur in the daytime?”
253𓀴
254𓀴“None, except the queer
 behavior of my dog.”
255𓀴
256𓀴“Hem. You have stated
 a very interesting
 case, Miss Van Loan. I, for
257𓀴one, will be very
 glad to investigate
 the phenomena which have been
258𓀴troubling you.”
259𓀴
260𓀴“And I will be glad to go,
 too, if you want me,” I said.
261𓀴
262𓀴The young lady seemed pleased.
263𓀴
264𓀴“I hope that I may have the help
 of both of you--and soon,” she said
265𓀴earnestly.
266𓀴
267𓀴The doctor turned to me.
268𓀴
269𓀴“How about going this
 evening?” he asked.
270𓀴
271𓀴“Suits me.”
272𓀴
273𓀴“Good. We can drive
 out easily in an
 hour. You may expect us about dusk,
274𓀴Miss Loan.”
275𓀴
276𓀴“You know the address?”
277𓀴
278𓀴“I have visited your uncle several
 times, and he has also been my guest
279𓀴here.”
280𓀴
281𓀴“To be sure. I have heard Uncle
 Gordon speak of you. Goodby, until
282𓀴dusk--and thank you, much...”
283𓀴
284𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
285𓀴
286𓀴Our drive, that evening, through
 the red-gold light of the waning
287𓀴afternoon, was both pleasant
 and uneventful.
 After a sultry day in the
288𓀴loop, it was refreshing
 to ride through
 the cool, tree-shaded north
289𓀴shore suburbs. Dr.
 Dorp, as was his
 wont when on the trail of a new
290𓀴mystery, was in the best
 of spirits--laughing
 and chatting gaily.
291𓀴
292𓀴We arrived in Highland
 Park just at
 dusk, and presently turned into a
293𓀴narrow driveway which
 circled through
 a heavily wooded estate. At first
294𓀴no house was visible,
 but presently,
 as we wound through the darkest and
295𓀴gloomiest copse we
 had yet encountered,
 it came unexpectedly into
296𓀴view--an ancient
 brick homestead of
 the Dutch Colonial type, with gables
297𓀴that drooped despondently,
 and chimneys
 surmounted by double tiles that
298𓀴stood out against
 the background of
 gray sky like headless torsos with
299𓀴arms upraised to heaven.
300𓀴
301𓀴As we drew up before the entrance,
 the noise of the doctor’s motor
302𓀴ceased, and from just beyond the
 background of trees, there came a
303𓀴throbbing, pulsating
 murmur which had
 not previously been audible to us,
304𓀴announcing the proximity
 of Lake Michigan.
305𓀴
306𓀴Scarcely had we set
 foot on the porch,
 when the door opened silently and
307𓀴a gray haired, white
 jacketed man with
 burning gray eyes that looked out
308𓀴from hollow recesses
 in a pale, wrinkled,
 and cadaverous countenance,
309𓀴stood aside, hand on latch, for us
 to enter. So loathsome in appearance
310𓀴was this deathlike creature that I
 had a feeling of repugnance even at
311𓀴the thought of permitting him to
 take my hat in his bony, claw-like
312𓀴hands.
313𓀴
314𓀴After disposing of our
 hats, he conducted
 us to a commodious living
315𓀴room, tastily furnished,
 where we were
 greeted by our charming hostess.
316𓀴Then he silently withdrew,
 closing the door after him.
317𓀴
318𓀴Although she maintained
 a brave, calm
 demeanor, I noticed that the hand
319𓀴of Miss Van Loan was trembling as
 I took it in mine. The doctor, also,
320𓀴must have noticed
 this, for he quickly
 transferred his long, slim
321𓀴fingers to her pulse.
322𓀴
323𓀴“Has anything happened?” he
 asked consulting his watch.
324𓀴
325𓀴“Nothing yet, but I
 have been oppressed
 by a horrible feeling which I
326𓀴cannot explain. I
 have worried, too,
 for fear something might prevent
327𓀴your coming.”
328𓀴
329𓀴“You are a very brave
 young woman,”
 he said, pocketing his watch and
330𓀴releasing her wrist, “but you have
 been under exceptionally severe
331𓀴nervous strain. Just
 now you are beginning
 to feel the reaction. Your
332𓀴heart, however, is
 good, and I believe
 another night of it can do you no
333𓀴permanent injury. Were this not
 the case, I should advise you to
334𓀴immediately leave
 this house, despite
 the tremendous financial stake
335𓀴involved.”
336𓀴
337𓀴“But, doctor, do
 you think the--the
 presence, can be driven out in one
338𓀴night?”
339𓀴
340𓀴“That is my hope.
 I have a theory--”
341𓀴
342𓀴His speech was suddenly
 interrupted
 by a noisy rattling of the
343𓀴doorknob--the very door which the
 servant had silently closed a few
344𓀴minutes before.
345𓀴
346𓀴“It is coming!” said
 the girl breathlessly,
 a note of terror in her
347𓀴voice.
348𓀴
349𓀴The three of us watched the door
 silently--intently. It opened,
350𓀴revealing the dimly
 lighted hallway,
 in which no living creature was
351𓀴visible. For a moment
 it remained open
 as if someone were standing there
352𓀴with a hand on the knob.
 Then it closed with a bang.
353𓀴
354𓀴I felt a prickly sensation
 in my scalp,
 then started from my tracks at
355𓀴the sound of a throaty
 rumble behind me.
356𓀴
357𓀴“That is Sandy, my
 Airedale,” explained
 the girl, “hiding in the corner
358𓀴behind the davenport. He always
 growls when it comes.”
359𓀴
360𓀴“I believe he scared me worse than
 _it_,” I said with a nervous laugh,
361𓀴sinking back on the
 davenport, relieved
 by the realization that the
362𓀴noise, at least, had been earthly.
363𓀴
364𓀴“It is now in the room,” said the
 girl. “Don’t you feel a strange
365𓀴presence?”
366𓀴
367𓀴“Not yet,” said the
 doctor gravely.
368𓀴
369𓀴We waited breathlessly
 for the next
 manifestation. For several minutes
370𓀴the only sounds I could hear were
 those which drifted through the two
371𓀴open windows, one on each side of
 the fireplace--the clatter of frogs,
372𓀴the piping of nocturnal
 insects, the
 incessant muffled roar of the surf
373𓀴on the beach, and the occasional
 call of a night bird. Then a heavy
374𓀴poker, which had been
 leaning against
 the fireplace, clattered to the
375𓀴tiles, slid across
 them, and progressed
 with a queer jerky motion across
376𓀴the rug to the center of the room.
 It remained there for a moment, then
377𓀴twirled around and
 came straight toward
 me, still with the same jerky
378𓀴motion. When it seemed about to
 strike my feet I drew them up,
379𓀴half-expecting the
 thing to leap at me.
380𓀴
381𓀴Despite this singular and, to me,
 inexplicable phenomenon, Dr. Dorp
382𓀴maintained, unruffled, his look
 of complete absorption. The girl,
383𓀴however, was manifestly alarmed.
384𓀴
385𓀴“Be careful, Mr. Evans,”
 she said tensely.
 “I’m afraid it may hurt you.”
386𓀴
387𓀴Somehow I did not want
 to appear cowardly
 in the eyes of this girl. The
388𓀴heavy poker which
 had performed such
 amazing antics now lay quiescent,
389𓀴and apparently quite
 harmless, at my feet.
390𓀴
391𓀴Simulating a calmness which I was
 far from feeling, I bent over and
392𓀴picked the thing
 up. I was examining
 it minutely, half-expecting to find
393𓀴some mechanical attachment which
 would prove the whole thing a hoax,
394𓀴when it was suddenly and forcibly
 jerked from my grasp. It thumped to
395𓀴the floor, then spun half around
 and traveled jerkily back to the
396𓀴fireplace.
397𓀴
398𓀴“What made you drop it?” asked
 the doctor. “Wasn’t hot, was it?”
399𓀴
400𓀴When I told him that it had been
 jerked from my hands, he seemed
401𓀴surprised.
402𓀴
403𓀴“Are you sure you didn’t just
 drop it from--ah--nervousness?”
404𓀴
405𓀴“Positive.”
406𓀴
407𓀴“Hem. Strange.”
408𓀴
409𓀴We sat for several minutes without
 incident. Then I noticed that the
410𓀴lights were growing
 dim. I concentrated
 my gaze on the filaments of the
411𓀴reading lamp beside
 me. Slowly, almost
 imperceptibly, they were losing
412𓀴their incandescence.
413𓀴
414𓀴Presently the room
 was in darkness,
 save for the dim twilight which came
415𓀴through the two windows.
 I could barely
 discern the figures of my two
416𓀴companions, blending
 with the shadowy
 outlines of the chairs in which
417𓀴they sat. A strange,
 musty odor assailed
 my nostrils. I felt a cold
418𓀴touch on the back of my hand, and
 automatically jerked it away. Then a
419𓀴breeze, icy cold,
 chilled me to the
 marrow. The dog growled ominously.
420𓀴
421𓀴A light thud, as
 if some object had
 fallen, attracted my attention to
422𓀴the center of the room.
 Scarcely crediting
 the evidence of my senses, I
423𓀴saw a pale, luminous figure rising
 from the floor. The thing was
424𓀴irregular in outline, and swayed
 this way and that as if wafted by
425𓀴eddying air currents. Taller and
 taller it grew, until, when it had
426𓀴reached a height
 of nearly six feet,
 it bore some resemblance to a human
427𓀴figure shrouded in a
 white, filmy material.
428𓀴
429𓀴Although my flesh crept and chills
 chased each other up and down my
430𓀴spine, I remembered
 that I was here
 to investigate this thing, and
431𓀴rising, forced myself
 to walk stealthily
 toward the center of the room.
432𓀴As I approached the grim wraith it
 grew taller, towering menacingly
433𓀴above me, and a queer,
 sickening odor
 became momentarily stronger--an
434𓀴odor which might
 have been produced
 by a combination of the fumes of
435𓀴brimstone with the offensive
 effluvium of putrefying flesh.
436𓀴
437𓀴By the time I was
 within two feet of
 the thing I was nearly strangled by
438𓀴its horrible stench,
 but I had made
 up my mind to test its solidity at
439𓀴last, and stretched out my hand to
 touch it. The hand encountered no
440𓀴resistance. Moving
 it horizontally,
 I passed my hand clear through it
441𓀴from side to side. By this time my
 eyes were watering so badly from the
442𓀴effect of the acrid fumes that I
 was scarcely able to see. Then the
443𓀴lights flashed on,
 completely blinding
 me for a moment with their
444𓀴brilliance. A moment later
 I was able to see clearly.
445𓀴
446𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
447𓀴
448𓀴A cry from Dr. Dorp aroused me.
449𓀴
450𓀴“Quick, Evans,” he said, ”the girl
 has fainted. We must get her into the
451𓀴open air.”
452𓀴
453𓀴He was endeavoring
 to lift her himself,
 but found her weight too much
454𓀴for him. Being his junior
 by some thirty-five
 years and of a rather more
455𓀴substantial build, I found her
 slight form no burden whatever.
456𓀴
457𓀴“Open the doors, doctor,”
 I said. “I’ll do the rest.”
458𓀴
459𓀴I had lifted the girl
 from the chair,
 and was turning toward the door,
460𓀴the doctor meanwhile advancing to
 open it. Before he could do so,
461𓀴however, the latch
 rattled, and the
 door swung open by itself. Quick as
462𓀴a flash, the doctor
 sprang out into
 the hall, peering this way and that.
463𓀴
464𓀴“Nobody here,” he said. “Come on.”
465𓀴
466𓀴I followed him down
 the hallway, this
 time close at his heels, with the
467𓀴girl still lying
 limply in my arms.
 He extended his hand, about to open
468𓀴the door which led
 to the front porch,
 when the knob turned, and this
469𓀴second door was opened
 as if by some
 invisible presence. Once more the
470𓀴doctor sprang forward, only
 to find the porch untenanted.
471𓀴
472𓀴I laid the still unconscious girl
 in the porch swing, at the behest of
473𓀴the doctor, who informed me that
 she would regain consciousness more
474𓀴quickly in a reclining position.
475𓀴
476𓀴“Now fan her with this magazine,
 Evans,” he instructed, handing me a
477𓀴copy of “_Science and Invention_”
 which he had taken from the porch
478𓀴table. He felt her
 pulse for a moment.
 “She’ll be all right in a few
479𓀴minutes. I’m going back to that
 room and have a look around. Keep
480𓀴fanning until she
 is fully revived.”
481𓀴
482𓀴Interested as I was
 in the phenomena
 which were taking place, I was glad
483𓀴of this brief respite and a chance
 to inhale some fresh air. The girl,
484𓀴unconscious, was
 free from the sway
 of fear for the time being, and I
485𓀴knew from the reassuring manner of
 the doctor that she was in no danger.
486𓀴While I continued to
 ply the improvised
 fan I could hear the doctor, or
487𓀴someone, moving about the house.
488𓀴
489𓀴Presently the girl’s
 eyelids fluttered,
 and she began talking--her words
490𓀴disconnected and broken like
 those of one in a dream.
491𓀴
492𓀴“Saw it--saw--spirit--Uncle
 Gordon.
 Must be--be his--ghost. Saw--put
493𓀴arm--through it.”
494𓀴
495𓀴Lightly I placed my
 hand on the smooth,
 cool forehead. Then she opened
496𓀴her eyes and looked
 earnestly into mine.
497𓀴
498𓀴“What--what was I
 saying?” she asked,
 apparently quite bewildered.
499𓀴
500𓀴“You fainted,” I replied. “Don’t
 worry. Everything is all right.”
501𓀴
502𓀴“But where is Dr. Dorp?”
503𓀴
504𓀴“Just went in the house
 to look around.
 He’ll be out in a few minutes,
505𓀴no doubt.”
506𓀴
507𓀴We waited a full
 twenty minutes, but
 still the doctor did not appear.
508𓀴Miss Van Loan had taken one of the
 wicker porch chairs, assuring me that
509𓀴she had fully recovered.
 I was sitting
 in another. All sounds in the
510𓀴house had ceased,
 and I began to feel
 some apprehension for the doctor’s
511𓀴safety.
512𓀴
513𓀴“Do you mind staying
 alone for a few
 minutes?” I asked. “I should like
514𓀴to go and see if my
 friend is all right.”
515𓀴
516𓀴“I’ll go with you,”
 she replied, rising.
517𓀴
518𓀴“Are you sure you
 are strong enough?”
519𓀴
520𓀴“Of course. Oh, I do hope nothing
 happened to him. I should never
521𓀴forgive myself.”
522𓀴
523𓀴We met the pale houseman
 in the hall.
524𓀴
525𓀴“Where is the doctor,
 Riggs?” she asked.
526𓀴
527𓀴“I don’t know, ma’am.
 I heard someone
 goin’ up the stairs a while ago.
528𓀴Might have been him.”
529𓀴
530𓀴“You haven’t seen him?”
531𓀴
532𓀴“No ma’am. I come
 in just now to ask
 if you would be a-needin’ of me any
533𓀴more this evenin’. I feel
 sort of tired like, after--”
534𓀴
535𓀴“I know, Riggs. You
 haven’t had much
 rest for the last three nights. You
536𓀴may go.”
537𓀴
538𓀴“Thank you, ma’am.”
539𓀴
540𓀴We ascended the stairs, the steps
 of which creaked weirdly under our
541𓀴weight. I could readily understand
 why Riggs had been able to hear them
542𓀴from the service quarters.
543𓀴
544𓀴At the top was a long hallway with
 a door at one end, a window at the
545𓀴other, and two doors
 on either side.
546𓀴
547𓀴Miss Van Loan opened
 the first door
 at our right, and we entered a
548𓀴bedroom daintily furnished in cane
 and ivory, with light blue hangings
549𓀴and spreads.
550𓀴
551𓀴“This is my room,”
 she informed me.
 “We have four bedrooms, each with a
552𓀴private bath and clothes closet.”
553𓀴
554𓀴I looked into the bath and clothes
 closet, but both were untenanted.
555𓀴Then we passed to
 the next room. This
 was furnished in burled walnut,
556𓀴with light green the
 prevailing color.
 No sign of the doctor here. The
557𓀴next room, which
 was just across the
 hall, was furnished in massive oak,
558𓀴with a taupe and maroon
 color scheme.
 Somehow it seemed thoroughly a
559𓀴man’s room.
560𓀴
561𓀴“This belonged to
 Uncle Gordon,” said
 the girl. “It was in that bed that
562𓀴he died.”
563𓀴
564𓀴I looked at the bed
 and somehow the
 gray and maroon of the bolster and
565𓀴spread reminded me
 of blood trickling
 over a sacrificial slab of
566𓀴granite. With this thought came an
 inexplicable feeling of horror which
567𓀴I could not shake off.
568𓀴
569𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
570𓀴
571𓀴“It is back!” said
 the girl, suddenly,
 a note of terror in her voice.
572𓀴
573𓀴She must have had the same feeling
 as I, at the same time, although
574𓀴nothing startling had happened--at
 least nothing that either of us could
575𓀴perceive with the aid
 of our five senses.
 The bathroom was empty, and I
576𓀴had started for the
 door of the closet,
 when the lights suddenly went
577𓀴out. Once more I was conscious
 of the peculiar, dusty odor I had
578𓀴detected in the room
 below. The girl
 shrieked. Then as if in answer to
579𓀴her cry, I heard a hollow groan
 and five distinct raps, apparently
580𓀴coming from the direction
 of the bed.
581𓀴
582𓀴The door of the closet which I had
 not searched was not more than a foot
583𓀴from the head of the
 bed. I could still
 see it, though indistinctly, by
584𓀴the dim, gray light
 which came in through
 the window. Although I am not
585𓀴superstitious, a nameless dread
 assailed me at the thought of
586𓀴approaching nearer to that bed in
 which the former owner of the house
587𓀴had breathed his
 last. I hesitated,
 berating myself for a coward and
588𓀴weakling--then forced
 myself toward the door.
589𓀴
590𓀴As I did so, I heard
 more raps, not
 quite so pronounced as formerly,
591𓀴then another moan, and sounds like
 those of a person gasping for breath.
592𓀴On reaching the door, I turned the
 knob, but found it locked. Then my
593𓀴fingers touched a
 key just below it.
 I turned this with difficulty. It
594𓀴seemed that either
 the lock was stuck,
 or something was resisting my
595𓀴efforts. Releasing the key, I once
 more attempted to open the door.
596𓀴Before I could turn
 the knob, however,
 the door again locked itself.
597𓀴From somewhere nearby,
 I heard a sound
 which plainly resembled the death
598𓀴rattle!
599𓀴
600𓀴Once more I succeeded in unlocking
 the door, although the key was bent
601𓀴in the process. Then, holding the
 key with my left hand, I turned the
602𓀴knob with my right, and applied my
 shoulder to the door. Someone, or
603𓀴some thing, was pushing against it
 on the other side. At first I only
604𓀴succeeded in moving
 it a fraction of
 an inch. Gathering my strength for
605𓀴a supreme effort, I forced it wide
 open. As I did so, a rush of icy cold
606𓀴air enveloped me
 from head to foot.
 Hot and perspiring from my exertions
607𓀴as I was, it chilled me to the
 marrow. My teeth chattered, and I
608𓀴shivered as if I had suddenly
 been immersed in ice-water.
609𓀴
610𓀴Within the closet, all was black,
 as no light reached it from the
611𓀴window. Holding one
 foot against the
 door, which was still resisting my
612𓀴efforts, I lighted
 a match. It went
 out almost as soon as I struck it,
613𓀴but I had seen enough.
 Beneath a mound
 of clothing, evidently snatched
614𓀴from the hooks on the wall,
 lay a human figure.
615𓀴
616𓀴Stooping, I succeeded in grasping
 a foot and ankle. Then I dragged the
617𓀴body with its accompanying
 mound of
 clothing, from the closet. By this
618𓀴time my fingers were
 so numbed with
 cold that I could scarcely use them.
619𓀴I took my foot from the door, and
 it closed with a vicious bang.
620𓀴
621𓀴Miss Van Loan had apparently
 recovered,
 in some measure, from her fit of
622𓀴terror, for she came up beside me.
623𓀴
624𓀴“What is it? What
 did you find in the
 closet?” she whispered, peering at
625𓀴the shapeless thing which lay
 there in the dim, gray light.
626𓀴
627𓀴Without taking time to reply,
 I hastily removed the pile of
628𓀴miscellaneous clothing from the
 body. Then my hand touched a cold
629𓀴forehead--a hairy face.
630𓀴
631𓀴“Open the door, quickly!”
 I ordered.
 “My God, I’m afraid we have come
632𓀴too late.”
633𓀴
634𓀴She promptly did
 as she was bidden,
 while I gathered the cold, still
635𓀴form of Dr. Dorp in my arms. Then
 I staggered out of the room, across
636𓀴the hall, down the
 creaking stairway,
 and out upon the porch, the girl
637𓀴following. As I laid the doctor in
 the swing where I had deposited the
638𓀴mistress of the house less than an
 hour before, the lights flashed on
639𓀴once more.
640𓀴
641𓀴“Rouse the servants,”
 I said. “Telephone
 for a doctor. Then bring hot
642𓀴water, towels, blankets, hot-water
 bottles--and some brandy.”
643𓀴
644𓀴While she was gone, I alternately
 slapped, kneaded and rubbed the cold
645𓀴flesh of my friend. She returned
 in a few minutes that seemed like
646𓀴hours, with two hot water bottles
 and an armful of towels. Behind her
647𓀴toddled a stout, round-faced woman
 in a red kimono, with a steaming
648𓀴kettle of water in one hand and
 a bottle and glass in the other.
649𓀴
650𓀴We applied the various articles
 with better will than skill, and a
651𓀴moment later Riggs
 appeared in bathrobe
 and slippers carrying four thick
652𓀴woolen blankets.
 Another ten minutes
 elapsed before we succeeded in even
653𓀴warming the flesh of our patient.
654𓀴
655𓀴“We haven’t any brandy,
 so I brought
 a bottle of Uncle Gordon’s
656𓀴whiskey,” said the girl. “Do you
 think we had better give him some?”
657𓀴
658𓀴“Not yet,” I replied.
 “It might strangle
 him if he has enough life left
659𓀴in him to strangle.”
660𓀴
661𓀴The rumble of a motor
 sounded in the
 driveway, and two bright headlights
662𓀴flashed on the porch.
 A coupe pulled
 up with shrieking brakes and a
663𓀴young man, carrying
 a small satchel,
 got out and dashed up the steps.
664𓀴
665𓀴“This way, Dr. Graves,” called the
 girl, beckoning him to the swing
666𓀴where my friend lay.
667𓀴
668𓀴“Why, it’s Dr. Dorp!”
 said the young
 physician, taking the pulse of my
669𓀴friend. “What happened to him?”
670𓀴
671𓀴“Asphyxiation,” I replied, “and
 exposure to extreme cold.”
672𓀴
673𓀴Dr. Graves took a stethoscope from
 his case and used it for a few
674𓀴moments.
675𓀴
676𓀴“The doctor has sustained quite a
 severe shock,” he said, “but he is
677𓀴doing nicely now. There is nothing
 I can give him or do for him at this
678𓀴stage which will
 help matters. Fresh
 air and warmth are our best allies
679𓀴now.”
680𓀴
681𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
682𓀴
683𓀴My friend regained consciousness
 five minutes later. He immediately
684𓀴recognized Dr. Graves,
 who had attended
 a number of his lectures before
685𓀴members of the medical fraternity,
 and had entered into discussions with
686𓀴him.
687𓀴
688𓀴While the two were talking,
 the housekeeper
 went in for some hot water,
689𓀴lemon and sugar for
 a toddy. She had
 only been absent for a few minutes
690𓀴when we were all alarmed
 by the sound
 of barking and snarling within the
691𓀴house, punctuated
 by piercing screams.
692𓀴
693𓀴Dr. Graves was the
 first to reach the
 door, where he paused. I attempted
694𓀴to force my way past him, but
 he stayed me with his arm.
695𓀴
696𓀴“Get back, woman!”
 he shouted to someone
 within. “Get back and close the
697𓀴door. The creature is mad.”
698𓀴
699𓀴At the far end of the hall, I saw
 the stout wife of the house man
700𓀴apparently rooted to the floor by
 horror. Just in front of her, the
701𓀴Airedale, growling and
 snarling savagely,
 was rapidly demolishing the
702𓀴upholstering of a
 beautiful antique
 settee. The hairy jaws of the
703𓀴creature were flecked
 with white foam,
 and the eyes were bloodshot and
704𓀴unnaturally luminescent from
 extreme dilation of the pupils.
705𓀴
706𓀴Seeing the peril in which the poor
 woman was placed, I caught up one of
707𓀴the porch chairs
 and rushed past the
 doctor. The dog took no notice of
708𓀴me until I swung at
 it with the chair.
 Then it dodged with surprising
709𓀴dexterity and leaped
 for my throat,
 just as two of the chair legs were
710𓀴shattered against
 the floor. I managed
 to elude it by quickly crouching
711𓀴behind the chair back, so that
 it passed clear over my head.
712𓀴
713𓀴It was up again in
 an instant, however,
 and I had all I could do to
714𓀴protect myself from
 its leaps by fencing
 with the remains of the chair.
715𓀴Almost before I was
 aware of it, the
 beast had backed me into the living
716𓀴room. Then, to my horror, the door
 closed, and the lights winked out.
717𓀴
718𓀴I shall never forget the battle I
 fought in that dark room. That which
719𓀴had been a shaggy
 creature of flesh
 and bone in the light, had become a
720𓀴pair of burning orbs,
 set in a shadowy
 form, that leaped, snapped, and
721𓀴snarled in a manner
 which was twice
 as terrifying as its former attacks
722𓀴had been when each
 move was completely
 visible. Now I was guided only by
723𓀴the movements of
 the luminous eyes,
 whereas I had previously been able
724𓀴to forecast each hostile
 move or leap
 by the crouch or muscular tension
725𓀴which preceded it.
726𓀴
727𓀴Using the chair as a
 shield, I eventually
 managed to circle back to the
728𓀴door. With one hand I attempted to
 turn the knob, while I manipulated
729𓀴the chair with the other. The door
 was locked. I immediately felt below
730𓀴for the key, recalling that it had
 been there earlier in the evening. It
731𓀴was gone!
732𓀴
733𓀴My canine adversary
 made a determined
 leap that forced me to one side.
734𓀴Then some one pounded on the door,
 and I heard the voice of Dr. Graves.
735𓀴
736𓀴“Unlock the door, Mr. Evans. I
 have a gun and electric torch.”
737𓀴
738𓀴“There is no key on
 this side,” I replied.
 Then I caught a glimpse of a
739𓀴light flashing through the keyhole
 and wondered what had become of the
740𓀴key.
741𓀴
742𓀴“It must have fallen
 to the floor on
 that side,” said the young doctor.
743𓀴“I cannot find it in the hall.”
744𓀴
745𓀴I again succeeded in maneuvering
 to a position in front of the door.
746𓀴Then I tramped about
 in front of it
 until my shoe struck a hard object.
747𓀴Stooping, I picked
 it up, and rejoiced
 to find that the doctor had been
748𓀴right. Again using one
 hand to manipulate
 the chair, I inserted the key
749𓀴in the lock and managed
 to turn it,
 though with considerable difficulty.
750𓀴
751𓀴“Turn the knob,” I
 shouted, “and push.”
752𓀴
753𓀴The knob turned,
 and the door opened
 behind me. A beam of light shot
754𓀴past me, for a moment illuminating
 the hairy face and dripping fangs of
755𓀴the brute. Then a
 shot rang out, the
 light faded from the luminous eyes,
756𓀴and the beast sank
 slowly to the floor,
 blood gushing from its mouth and
757𓀴nostrils.
758𓀴
759𓀴“Good shot, doctor,”
 I said, turning
 and releasing my hold on the
760𓀴battered chair. To my surprise
 I saw Miss Van Loan holding the
761𓀴flashlight in one
 hand and a smoking
 pistol in the other, while great
762𓀴tears trickled down her cheeks.
763𓀴
764𓀴“You!” I cried.
765𓀴
766𓀴“I was holding these
 while the doctor
 went for a ladder,” she said. “He
767𓀴was going to try to
 help you by climbing
 up to the window. Then I heard
768𓀴you call. Poor Sandy.”
769𓀴
770𓀴“Too bad you had
 to kill your pet,”
 I replied, closing the door and
771𓀴relieving her of gun and torch.
772𓀴
773𓀴“W--wasn’t it horrible?”
 she sobbed.
 “B-but I had to do it. He might
774𓀴have k-killed you.”
775𓀴
776𓀴I was about to thank
 her for having
 saved my life when the young doctor
777𓀴suddenly came up
 from the basement,
 dragging a stepladder. Seeing us
778𓀴standing there in the hall,
 he laid it down and joined us.
779𓀴
780𓀴“You have been rescued,
 I see,” he said.
781𓀴
782𓀴“Most bravely,” I replied.
783𓀴
784𓀴“Did the beast bite
 or scratch you?”
785𓀴
786𓀴“No.”
787𓀴
788𓀴“Are you sure? Sometimes
 a wound goes
 unnoticed in the heat of combat.
789𓀴Perhaps I had better
 look you over.
 I am reasonably sure the dog had
790𓀴hydrophobia.”
791𓀴
792𓀴He forthwith examined
 me with the aid
 of the flashlight. I had not known
793𓀴it before, but my left coat sleeve
 was torn, and my arm was bleeding
794𓀴where the sharp fangs
 had raked it.
795𓀴
796𓀴“Infected,” he said,
 “and of course
 I have no serum with me. Come out on
797𓀴the porch.”
798𓀴
799𓀴On the porch, he made a ligature
 with a towel and a pair of long
800𓀴scissors. Then he took a bottle
 and some cotton from his case and
801𓀴drenched the wounds
 with silver nitrate.
802𓀴
803𓀴“Better come to the
 hospital with me
 at once for a serum treatment,” he
804𓀴advised. “It may save your life.”
805𓀴
806𓀴“But I can’t leave my
 friends----” I began.
807𓀴
808𓀴“Nonsense,” interrupted Dr. Dorp,
 who was sitting up, although still
809𓀴muffled in a blanket.
 “Miss Van Loan
 and I will be all right here on the
810𓀴porch until you get back.”
811𓀴
812𓀴“Of course,” said the girl. “You
 have put your life in sufficient
813𓀴jeopardy as it is, Mr. Evans.”
814𓀴
815𓀴Thus admonished, I
 got into the coupe
 with the young doctor, and we set
816𓀴out for the hospital.
817𓀴
818𓀴“Queer thing the
 way that door shut
 and locked itself,” he said, when we
819𓀴emerged on the smooth
 paving of Sheridan
 Road. “The key must have been
820𓀴half turned in the
 lock when the wind
 blew it shut. The jar locked it
821𓀴and shook out the key.”
822𓀴
823𓀴Although I did not feel that his
 explanation of the phenomenon was a
824𓀴true one, I decided
 not to debate the
 matter with him, as it was evident
825𓀴that Miss Van Loan did not want it
 known among her acquaintances that
826𓀴there were strange goings-on
 in her home.
827𓀴
828𓀴“It was odd,” I agreed.
829𓀴
830𓀴“Too bad that the lights had to go
 out just when they did, too,” he went
831𓀴on. “A most unfortunate
 coincidence.”
832𓀴
833𓀴“It was,” I said, with
 mental reservations.
834𓀴
835𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
836𓀴
837𓀴An hour later at the hospital, my
 wound was dressed and a considerable
838𓀴quantity of serum injected into my
 bloodstream. Then I called a cab
839𓀴which got me back to my friends
 shortly after midnight.
840𓀴
841𓀴I found Dr. Dorp dozing
 in one of the
 porch chairs with a blanket around
842𓀴him, and Miss Van Loan, completely
 exhausted, asleep in the swing.
843𓀴
844𓀴“Better try to get
 some rest in one
 of these chairs,” said the doctor.
845𓀴“There is nothing further
 we can do until morning.”
846𓀴
847𓀴I was not loath to follow
 his suggestion,
 and soon drifted into a
848𓀴fitful, dream-haunted slumber from
 which I did not thoroughly awaken
849𓀴until the slanting
 rays of the morning
 sun struck me full in the face.
850𓀴
851𓀴For a moment I sat there, blinking
 in the bright light, trying to
852𓀴remember where I
 was. Then the sound
 of a low cough from the doorway
853𓀴caused me to turn. I
 beheld the cadaverous
 face and angular form of
854𓀴Riggs.
855𓀴
856𓀴“Good morning, sir,” he said.
857𓀴
858𓀴“Good morning, Riggs.”
859𓀴
860𓀴“Will you have your bath
 hot or cold, sir?”
861𓀴
862𓀴“The colder the better.”
863𓀴
864𓀴“Thank you, sir.”
865𓀴
866𓀴A few moments later I was shaving
 with a razor which Riggs informed me
867𓀴had belonged to his
 late master, while
 a sizable column of cold water
868𓀴roared into the tub.
 While I bathed
 and dressed, the houseman repaired
869𓀴the rent in my sleeve. A half-hour
 afterward, feeling greatly rested and
870𓀴refreshed, I went
 down to breakfast.
 Miss Van Loan met me in the dining
871𓀴room where places had
 been laid for two.
872𓀴
873𓀴“Dr. Dorp left early this morning
 for the city,” she informed me. “He
874𓀴asked me to have you wait here
 until his return this afternoon.”
875𓀴
876𓀴“He could not have set
 me a more pleasant
 task,” I replied, receiving my
877𓀴cup of coffee from the
 hand of my charming
 hostess. “Did he mention what
878𓀴urgent business took
 him to the city?”
879𓀴
880𓀴“Something about
 some investigations
 he wished to make, and some
881𓀴paraphernalia he would
 need for tonight,”
 she said. “He was in a great
882𓀴hurry. Wouldn’t even stop
 for a bite of breakfast.”
883𓀴
884𓀴“That is his way,”
 I replied, “when
 engrossed in a particularly
885𓀴interesting investigation. He will
 probably neither eat nor drink until
886𓀴the mystery has been solved.”
887𓀴
888𓀴“And will that be soon?”
889𓀴
890𓀴“I believe it will.”
891𓀴
892𓀴“Just what is your opinion, Mr.
 Evans, of the things you saw last
893𓀴night?”
894𓀴
895𓀴“I’m afraid,” I replied, “that my
 opinion at this time is not of much
896𓀴value. Frankly, I
 have been mystified.
 I have theories, of course, but
897𓀴they are, after all,
 only theories.”
898𓀴
899𓀴“Do you believe it was the ghost
 of Uncle Gordon that we saw in the
900𓀴living room last night?”
901𓀴
902𓀴“I don’t believe in ghosts.”
903𓀴
904𓀴“Then what was it? What could have
 caused it? What could have caused
905𓀴doors to lock and unlock, to open
 and close without the touch of human
906𓀴hands? What could have caused the
 intense cold--the poker to creep
907𓀴across the floor as
 if it were alive?
 What drove my dog mad with fear?”
908𓀴
909𓀴“The dog,” I replied, “showed
 symptoms of hydrophobia.”
910𓀴
911𓀴“That is what Dr. Dorp
 thought, although
 he was not sure. He took the
912𓀴carcass with him, wrapped
 in a sheet for examination.”
913𓀴
914𓀴“Then his opinion confirms
 that of Dr. Graves.”
915𓀴
916𓀴“I don’t see how poor
 Sandy could have
 gotten it,” she said. “He hasn’t
917𓀴been near any other animal, and
 I understand he would have to be
918𓀴scratched or bitten by
 one to become infected.”
919𓀴
920𓀴“The examination will show whether
 or not he had hydrophobia, and I hope
921𓀴he hadn’t,” I replied, “for a very
 personal reason. Just how he
922𓀴contracted it, of course,
 may never be known.”
923𓀴
924𓀴“For your sake, I too hope that he
 didn’t have it. You are in grave
925𓀴danger, are you not,
 from that bite?”
926𓀴
927𓀴“Not so bad as all
 that. A comparatively
 short time ago it was the
928𓀴equivalent of a death warrant to
 be bitten by a rabid animal. Modern
929𓀴science, however, has made death
 from hydrophobia a rarity when
930𓀴treatment is administered
 in time.”
931𓀴
932𓀴                  *     
  *       *       *       *
933𓀴
934𓀴The remainder of the day was spent
 quite pleasantly, strolling about the
935𓀴grounds and on the
 white, foam-edged
 beach, or lolling on the large,
936𓀴conformable porch.
937𓀴
938𓀴We had dinner at six,
 and I was enjoying
 a cigar in the swing shortly
939𓀴thereafter, when I heard the throb
 of a motor in the driveway and the
940𓀴big car of Dr. Dorp
 came into view.
941𓀴
942𓀴He drove up to the curb, and I saw
 that he had four men with him. Each
943𓀴was carrying a large
 package covered
 with khaki. The packages were
944𓀴placed on the porch,
 and the doctor
 presented his four companions, as
945𓀴Mr. Easton, civil engineer, Mr.
 Brandon, electrical engineer, and
946𓀴Messrs. Hogan and Rafferty,
 detectives.
 At a sign from the doctor, the
947𓀴two detectives immediately
 strolled
 out into the shrubbery.
948𓀴
949𓀴“We’re going to make
 a few preparations
 for the show this evening,” he
950𓀴said, addressing me.
 “Want to come along?”
951𓀴
952𓀴“Of course.”
953𓀴
954𓀴“All right. Each
 man grab a bundle.
 We haven’t much time before dark.”
955𓀴
956𓀴I took up one of the khaki-wrapped
 packages, which was far from light,
957𓀴and each other man did likewise.
 The doctor led the way around the
958𓀴house, and down to the beach.
959𓀴
960𓀴Directly behind the
 house we unwrapped
 two of the packages. One proved
961𓀴to be a set of surveyor’s
 instruments
 which the civil engineer quickly
962𓀴assembled. The other looked very
 much like a radio set with its loop
963𓀴aerials and dials, although there
 was no speaker or headphone with it.
964𓀴The radio set was
 placed on a small
 folding table, and Mr. Easton
965𓀴sighted from that point, while I
 acted as roadman and Mr. Brandon as
966𓀴chainman. We measured
 off a distance
 of two thousand feet in a straight
967𓀴line along the beach,
 the doctor following
 with the other package. At
968𓀴that point, the other
 radio-like machine
 was assembled and placed on a
969𓀴folding table. We left Mr. Brandon
 with this machine, and went back to
970𓀴the first one.
971𓀴
972𓀴“Now, Evans,” said my friend. “You
 and Mr. Easton go back to the house
973𓀴and keep Miss Van Loan company. As
 soon as it begins to get dark go into
974𓀴the living room and
 occupy the same
 positions as last night. Mr. Easton
975𓀴has a false beard with him, and
 will be disguised to look like me.
976𓀴Caution Miss Van Loan, when she is
 inside the house, to address Mr.
977𓀴Easton by my name.
 Do not, under any
 circumstances, tell her this while
978𓀴you are in the house.
 When you hear
 my motor racing outside, come out.
979𓀴Mr. Easton will remain.
 Rafferty will
 then go in to take your place. Is
980𓀴everything clear?”
981𓀴
982𓀴“Perfectly.”
983𓀴
984𓀴We found Miss Van
 Loan on the porch,
 and I whispered our plans to her
985𓀴while Easton adjusted
 his whiskers.
 He was about the same build and
986𓀴height as the doctor,
 and thus disguised,
 bore considerable resemblance
987𓀴to him.
988𓀴
989𓀴We chatted on the
 porch until dusk,
 then went into the living room and
990𓀴took our seats. Presently the door
 opened and closed as on the night
991𓀴before. Then the lights went out.
 Hearing a rustling sound near the
992𓀴door, I looked, and
 saw the gleaming
 print of a human foot forming on
993𓀴the carpet. In a
 moment another had
 formed in front of it while the
994𓀴rustling sound continued.
 The first
 footprint disappeared and a third
995𓀴formed in front of the second. It
 was as if some invisible entity were
996𓀴walking toward the center of the
 room, leaving luminous tracks which
997𓀴disappeared each time
 a foot was lifted.
998𓀴
999𓀴The footprints stopped,
 and drew together,
 side by side, in the center
1000𓀴of the room. Then
 there was a slight
 thump, and a wispy form, similar to
1001𓀴the one we had seen
 the night before,
 began to materialize while the two
1002𓀴footprints slowly
 faded. The thing
 reached a height of more than six
1003𓀴feet, wabbling this
 way and that as
 if scarcely able to support its own
1004𓀴weight, while the horrible odor
 we had noticed the night before
1005𓀴permeated the room.
1006𓀴
1007𓀴Suddenly the lights
 flashed on, and
 the apparition disappeared. Noticing
1008𓀴that there was something
 glistening
 on the floor where the thing had
1009𓀴stood, I went over
 to investigate.
 There was a small pool of clear,
1010𓀴foul-smelling liquid
 rapidly soaking
 into the rug. As I bent over to
1011𓀴examine it I heard
 a cry of warning
 from the girl and a quick movement
1012𓀴behind me. I turned,
 but could not
 move in time to avoid the heavy chair
1013𓀴which was rushing
 toward me. It knocked
 me flat, fell over me, righted
1014𓀴itself, and came back, apparently
 bent on my destruction. I managed to
1015𓀴roll out of its way
 and get to my feet,
 but it promptly chased me to the
1016𓀴davenport, behind
 which I took shelter.
1017𓀴
1018𓀴“Holy mackerel!” exclaimed
 the pseudo Dr. Dorp.
1019𓀴
1020𓀴The chair, apparently
 realizing that
 it was baffled, swung about and
1021𓀴quickly returned to its
 place in the corner.
1022𓀴
1023𓀴The phenomena, thus
 far, including
 the materialization of the spectre,
1024𓀴had taken a little
 more than half an
 hour. I heard the sound for which I
1025𓀴had been listening--the
 roar of the doctor’s motor.
1026𓀴
1027𓀴“A remarkable chair,
 doctor,” I said.
 “The thing rather fagged me. I
1028𓀴think I’ll step out on the porch
 for a breath of cool air.”
1029𓀴
1030𓀴The door obligingly opened for me
 when I left the room. The front door,
1031𓀴however, was already
 open. Rafferty
 was standing on the porch.
1032𓀴
1033𓀴“Go on down to the
 car,” he whispered.
 “The doctor’s waitin’ for you.”
1034𓀴
1035𓀴I went, and climbed
 into the front
 seat beside the doctor. Detective
1036𓀴Hogan was in the back seat. We
 whirled away with moaning gears.
1037𓀴
1038𓀴The doctor handed
 me a folded map.
1039𓀴
1040𓀴“Open this, will you, Evans?” he
 requested. “Hold it beneath the dash
1041𓀴light. I don’t want
 to miss the road.”
1042𓀴
1043𓀴I opened it, and found
 it was a detailed
 map of Lake County. A large
1044𓀴triangle had been
 traced on the paper,
 its smallest angle resting on a
1045𓀴spot marked with an X, apparently
 some eight miles due west of our
1046𓀴present location.
1047𓀴
1048𓀴“Does X mark the
 spot where the body
 was found?” I asked, as we spun
1049𓀴around onto Sheridan
 Road on two wheels.
1050𓀴
1051𓀴“It marks the spot where I expect
 to find the source of Miss Van Loan’s
1052𓀴troubles,” replied
 the doctor. “It
 isn’t far, as the crow flies, but
1053𓀴there is no through road to it.
 We have a roundabout trip of about
1054𓀴sixteen miles ahead of us.”
1055𓀴
1056𓀴                  *    
   *       *       *       *
1057𓀴
1058𓀴We continued north
 on Sheridan Road
 for nearly four miles. Then we swung
1059𓀴west at Highwood,
 continuing in this
 direction for about eight miles.
1060𓀴Turning south on
 the Milwaukee road
 at Halfday, we covered another three
1061𓀴miles of road before the doctor
 slowed his terrific pace.
1062𓀴
1063𓀴“Take the wheel now, will you?”
 he requested, “and drive slowly.”
1064𓀴
1065𓀴We changed places, and I started
 off at a speed of about ten miles an
1066𓀴hour. The doctor lifted
 a small portable
 radio set from behind the back
1067𓀴seat, adjusted the
 tuning dials, and
 slowly moved the loop aerial back
1068𓀴and forth until
 there was an angry
 buzz from inside the machine. He then
1069𓀴continued to slowly turn the loop
 aerial as we moved along, apparently
1070𓀴with the purpose of keeping it in
 a position where the machine would
1071𓀴buzz the loudest.
1072𓀴
1073𓀴I noticed that, at
 first, the direction
 of the loop only made a very
1074𓀴slight deviation
 from the direction
 in which we were going. Gradually,
1075𓀴however, the deviation
 grew greater
 until the loop stood at right angles
1076𓀴to our course. We
 were, at the moment,
 passing the entrance to a lane,
1077𓀴which led to a farmhouse
 set back about
 half a mile from the road. As we
1078𓀴continued past the
 lane the aerial
 gradually straightened out toward our
1079𓀴course.
1080𓀴
1081𓀴About a thousand feet beyond
 the entrance to the lane was a
1082𓀴brightly-lighted filling station.
 We stopped there, left the car in
1083𓀴charge of the service
 man, and started
 across the fields. When we had
1084𓀴gone a short distance, the doctor
 handed me an automatic pistol.
1085𓀴
1086𓀴“I hope we won’t have
 to do any shooting,”
 he said, “but it’s safer to
1087𓀴be prepared.”
1088𓀴
1089𓀴It took us all of ten minutes
 to reach the farmhouse. It was in
1090𓀴darkness, except
 for one of the rear
 rooms, which was dimly lighted.
1091𓀴Admonishing us to
 tread carefully,
 the doctor led the way around the
1092𓀴house. As we rounded
 the rear porch,
 I saw that a four-wire aerial had
1093𓀴been stretched between the gable
 of the house and the barn. A wire
1094𓀴connected to the aerial led down
 into the dimly lighted rear room.
1095𓀴
1096𓀴Instructing us to
 stay where we were,
 the doctor crept stealthily up on
1097𓀴the porch and peered through the
 window. For five minutes at least he
1098𓀴stood there, looking
 into that room
 while we waited below. Then he
1099𓀴turned and beckoned
 to us. Neither
 Hogan nor I lost any time in getting
1100𓀴up to the window. I’m sure he was
 as curious as I to learn what was
1101𓀴going on in that room.
1102𓀴
1103𓀴Seated on a long bench before an
 instrument board which contained a
1104𓀴bewildering array
 of dials, buttons
 and levers, was a short, bull-necked
1105𓀴man. He wore a close-cropped,
 bristling
 pompadour, a thin, fiercely
1106𓀴upturned moustache,
 and an immense
 pair of thick-lensed, horn-rimmed
1107𓀴spectacles. A set
 of headphones covered
 his ears, and his pudgy hands
1108𓀴worked incessantly
 with the levers,
 dials and buttons on the board
1109𓀴before him. The only light in the
 room came from a panel of frosted
1110𓀴glass which was just
 above the instrument
 board. On the panel, which the
1111𓀴operator constantly watched, was
 a very clear shadow picture of the
1112𓀴living room I had
 quitted only a short
 time before, in the home of Miss
1113𓀴Van Loan.
1114𓀴
1115𓀴From where I stood
 I could see Miss
 Van Loan and the pseudo Dr. Dorp
1116𓀴seated just as I
 had left them, while
 Rafferty, who was impersonating
1117𓀴me, was staging a quite
 lively wrestling
 match in the center of the room
1118𓀴with the chair which had proven
 so hostile toward me earlier in the
1119𓀴evening.
1120𓀴
1121𓀴At a sign from Dr.
 Dorp, we drew our
 weapons and tiptoed to the door. It
1122𓀴was locked, and the
 key was in place,
 but Hogan opened it quickly and
1123𓀴silently with a
 small tool which he
 carried for the purpose. Before he
1124𓀴was aware of our presence we had
 the operator surrounded and covered.
1125𓀴The doctor jerked the phones
 from his head, and said:
1126𓀴
1127𓀴“Hands up, Mr. Hegel.
 You are under
 arrest.” His look of surprise and
1128𓀴alarm was quickly followed by a
 sullen frown as he thrust his pudgy
1129𓀴hands aloft.
1130𓀴
1131𓀴“Arrest? For what?” he
 demanded belligerently.
1132𓀴
1133𓀴“Nivver mind for what,
 my old buckaroo,”
 said Hogan, snapping the
1134𓀴handcuffs on his wrists. “I’ve
 a warrant in me pocket that covers
1135𓀴ivverything from
 interferin’ wid the
 radio reception on the north shore
1136𓀴down to attempted murder. Come
 away wid yez now, and don’t try no
1137𓀴shenanigans, or
 be the lord Harry,
 I’ll quiet yez wid this gun butt...”
1138𓀴
1139𓀴                  *    
   *       *       *       *
1140𓀴
1141𓀴Some two hours later, having left
 Hegel in the care of the proper
1142𓀴authorities, we were gathered in
 the living room of the Van Loan
1143𓀴home--the girl,
 the two engineers,
 the two detectives, Dr. Dorp, and I.
1144𓀴All were seated but the doctor,
 who stood before the fireplace. He
1145𓀴cleared his throat
 and looked around
 with his well-known lecture-room
1146𓀴air.
1147𓀴
1148𓀴“Now that the author
 of the strange
 phenomena which have confronted us
1149𓀴in this house has
 been apprehended,”
 he said, “explanations, and such
1150𓀴further investigations
 as are needed
 to completely clear up the mystery,
1151𓀴are in order.
1152𓀴
1153𓀴“You are all aware that
 the manifestations
 we have witnessed were under
1154𓀴the control of an
 operator established
 in an old farmhouse eight miles
1155𓀴west of here, and
 that the mechanism
 he used was a powerful and
1156𓀴complicated radio
 set. In order that
 you may thoroughly understand how
1157𓀴Ernest Hegel was able
 to make inanimate
 objects react to our movements
1158𓀴as if they were
 endowed with minds,
 let me explain that he could both
1159𓀴see and hear what was going on in
 this house as well as if he had been
1160𓀴here in person. Planted
 in this very
 room in such a clever manner as to
1161𓀴escape notice except
 by the most careful
 scrutiny, are powerful lenses
1162𓀴which acted as his
 eyes, and microphones
 which served as his distance
1163𓀴ears. If Miss Van
 Loan does not mind
 a slight mutilation of her walls in
1164𓀴the interests of
 our investigation,
 I will disclose one of each.”
1165𓀴
1166𓀴“I should like to see them,
 doctor,” said Miss Van Loan.
1167𓀴
1168𓀴The doctor took out
 his pocket knife
 and opened it. Then he walked to
1169𓀴the wall opposite
 us and scrutinized
 it very carefully. Presently he
1170𓀴held the point of
 the knife to a small
 spot which resembled thousands of
1171𓀴other spots on the
 mottled pattern
 of the wallpaper, and said:
1172𓀴
1173𓀴“Can you see this opening?”
1174𓀴
1175𓀴We all replied that we could not,
 and crowded around him. As we drew
1176𓀴close to it a small
 hole about the
 diameter of a lead pencil became
1177𓀴visible by concentration
 on the spot
 touched by the knife. Unless we had
1178𓀴been deliberately
 searching for it,
 it is probable that it would have
1179𓀴gone entirely unnoticed,
 due to its
 location on one of the dark spots in
1180𓀴the pattern of the paper itself.
1181𓀴
1182𓀴“This,” said the doctor, “is one
 of Hegel’s eyes.” He lightly tapped
1183𓀴inside the hole with the point
 of his knife and we heard it click
1184𓀴against some hard substance. Then
 he cut a square of paper and
1185𓀴plastering from around
 it, disclosing
 a black box which bore a close
1186𓀴resemblance to a
 small camera with
 a tiny lens in front. Taking a small
1187𓀴screwdriver from his
 pocket, he removed
 the front of the box, the back
1188𓀴of which was covered
 with row on row
 of small, circular affairs which he
1189𓀴described as photoelectric cells.
1190𓀴
1191𓀴“Each cell,” he said,
 “responds, according
 to the strength of light or
1192𓀴shade which strikes
 it through the
 lens, with a different wave length.
1193𓀴These various wave
 lengths are combined
 and transmitted from a common
1194𓀴antenna. At the
 receiving station,
 the process is reversed, and this
1195𓀴image is built up on ground glass
 by various vibrating light beams. For
1196𓀴a thorough description
 of this process,
 which I will not go into here, I
1197𓀴refer you to the book, ‘Radio for
 All.’ There are four ‘eyes’ like this
1198𓀴one in this room
 alone. Every other
 room in this house is as thoroughly
1199𓀴equipped.
1200𓀴
1201𓀴“And now for the ears.”
1202𓀴
1203𓀴He examined the
 wall until he found
 another hole, into which he thrust
1204𓀴the knife blade. Then he removed
 another square of wall paper and
1205𓀴plaster, revealing one of those
 instruments with which we were all
1206𓀴familiar--the microphone.
1207𓀴
1208𓀴“As this instrument
 needs no explanation,”
 he said, “I will now show you
1209𓀴how our friend Hegel
 managed to lock,
 unlock, open and close doors from
1210𓀴a distance of eight miles.”
1211𓀴
1212𓀴He walked to the
 door and opened it.
1213𓀴
1214𓀴“This door,” he said,
 “shows no signs
 of having been tampered with in
1215𓀴any way, yet I am
 convinced that there
 are at least two electric wires
1216𓀴connecting it with
 the current which
 Hegel tapped somewhere in front of
1217𓀴the meter--I have not
 yet discovered where.”
1218𓀴
1219𓀴With his screwdriver, he removed
 the bottom hinge, while we crowded
1220𓀴around him. Then
 he started to remove
 the top hinge, but found that the
1221𓀴first screw he tried
 would not turn.
 Abandoning it, he removed all the
1222𓀴other screws, then inserted the
 screwdriver beneath the hinge, and
1223𓀴pried. The hinge came loose, but
 revealed the fact that the screw had
1224𓀴been soldered to
 the metal back, and
 to a heavy wire which now protruded
1225𓀴from the wall. The
 whole thing had
 been insulated with electricians’
1226𓀴tape, and the block
 of wood in which
 it was fastened had been cut out,
1227𓀴surrounded with sealing wax, and
 replaced. He next removed the other
1228𓀴side of the hinge from the door,
 and found it similarly connected and
1229𓀴insulated, the wire leading
 to the interior of the door.
1230𓀴
1231𓀴Having cut the wire
 with a pair of
 pliers, the doctor laid the door on
1232𓀴its side and removed the lock and
 latch. Both were controlled by an
1233𓀴ingenious arrangement
 of electromagnets.
 The return current, he found,
1234𓀴was through round-headed,
 insulated
 contact screws, one on the door, and
1235𓀴one on the door jamb
 against which it fitted.
1236𓀴
1237𓀴He next turned his
 attention to the
 bottom of the door. It was evident
1238𓀴at a glance, that a long strip of
 wood had been removed, replaced with
1239𓀴glue, sanded and varnished. Using
 his screwdriver as a chisel, he pried
1240𓀴up the strip of wood, and removed
 from the cavity behind it a heavy bar
1241𓀴of iron.
1242𓀴
1243𓀴“Now,” he said,
 “if you will follow
 me to the basement I will show you
1244𓀴the mechanism which acted on this
 bar of iron, causing the door to open
1245𓀴or close.”
1246𓀴
1247𓀴                  *    
   *       *       *       *
1248𓀴
1249𓀴We filed down into the basement
 behind him, and he led the way to a
1250𓀴point directly beneath the living
 room door. The ceiling was covered
1251𓀴with plasterboard,
 a block of which
 he removed. Fastened to the floor in
1252𓀴a semicircle was a string
 of large electro-magnets.
1253𓀴
1254𓀴“All of these magnets,”
 he said, “were
 caused to act in their turns by
1255𓀴impulses of varying
 wave lengths which
 closed and opened their circuits.
1256𓀴Naturally they pulled the bar of
 iron although separated by two heavy
1257𓀴layers of wood, as
 there is no insulation
 which will stop magnetic
1258𓀴waves, thus closing
 or opening the
 door at the will of the operator. The
1259𓀴poker and the heavy
 overstuffed chair
 were caused to travel about the
1260𓀴room in the same
 manner, the latter
 probably having iron bars inserted
1261𓀴in the legs, by utilizing
 other electro-magnets
 fastened beneath the
1262𓀴floor and concealed
 by this plasterboard.
1263𓀴
1264𓀴“While we are here we may as well
 clear up the mystery of the luminous
1265𓀴footprints, for I see the removal
 of this square of ceiling has already
1266𓀴disclosed a part
 of the mechanism.
 You will observe here, a glass tube,
1267𓀴above which there
 are two lead plates.
 The top plate is movable, and is
1268𓀴connected with an
 electro-magnetic
 device for moving it. In the bottom
1269𓀴plate is cut in miniature,
 the shape
 of a human footprint. The glass
1270𓀴tube is what is
 known as a Crookes
 Tube, and the rays which emanate from
1271𓀴it when an electric connection is
 established are known as X-rays.
1272𓀴Although these rays
 are, in themselves,
 invisible, some of them have the
1273𓀴property of making
 certain substances
 phosphorescent. The rays which
1274𓀴have this property can be cut off
 by a lead screen of the correct
1275𓀴thickness. One of the substances
 which can be rendered luminous is
1276𓀴sulfid of zinc,
 and is probably the
 one used, although I have not yet
1277𓀴had an opportunity
 to verify this.
 The substance, whatever it may be,
1278𓀴has probably been ground
 into exceedingly
 minute particles and rubbed
1279𓀴into the rug above
 our heads. A luminous
 footprint can thus be made to
1280𓀴appear on the rug by
 the simple expedient
 of turning on the current in
1281𓀴the Crookes Tube and sliding back
 the upper plate in such a manner that
1282𓀴the toe prints will
 first be visible,
 then the ball of the foot, and
1283𓀴finally the heel. I’m sure that
 if we remove more squares of
1284𓀴plasterboard we
 will find a row of
 these contrivances about two feet
1285𓀴apart, leading to a point beneath
 the center of the room, where two of
1286𓀴them will be found side by side.
 For the present, however, we will go
1287𓀴upstairs to continue
 our investigation
 in other directions.”
1288𓀴
1289𓀴When we were once
 more in the living
 room, the doctor asked for a
1290𓀴stepladder, and Riggs was sent to
 bring one. When he brought it, the
1291𓀴doctor placed it in the center of
 the room and climbed up to where the
1292𓀴central lighting fixture
 projected from the wall.
1293𓀴
1294𓀴“In this fixture,” he
 said, “are concealed
 one of the sources of the icy
1295𓀴breath, and also
 the source of the
 ghastly and foul-smelling spectre
1296𓀴which rose from the center of the
 floor on two succeeding evenings. You
1297𓀴will observe that
 the entire fixture,
 central hemisphere and surrounding
1298𓀴collar, appears to
 be made from frosted
 glass. The central hemisphere
1299𓀴from which the light
 emanates is glass,
 but the surrounding collar is of
1300𓀴metal covered with
 a white substance.
 That white substance is common
1301𓀴frost.”
1302𓀴
1303𓀴So saying, he scraped
 off a quantity
 of the frost and handed it down to
1304𓀴us for our inspection.
1305𓀴
1306𓀴“Please take special
 notice of the
 designs on this collar,” he said,
1307𓀴“for they are particularly
 well suited
 for the purposes for which our
1308𓀴friend Hegel intended
 them--a series
 of circles, each about an inch from
1309𓀴the other, reaching
 entirely around
 the collar. I will now do by force
1310𓀴what the builder of this device
 previously did by mechanical means,
1311𓀴controlled by radio.”
1312𓀴
1313𓀴He took the screwdriver
 and, reaching
 up, inserted the end and pried at
1314𓀴one of the circles.
 It came open, revealing
 the fact that it was a small
1315𓀴hinged trap door.
 What surprised us
 the most, however, was the fact that
1316𓀴a small white globe fell out
 of it and broke on the rug.
1317𓀴
1318𓀴“Switch off the lights
 for a moment,” he said.
1319𓀴
1320𓀴Someone pressed the light switch,
 and all of us saw the now familiar
1321𓀴vision of a spectre materializing
 from the floor.
1322𓀴
1323𓀴“Turn them on,” he ordered.
1324𓀴
1325𓀴They were turned on once more.
1326𓀴
1327𓀴“The ghost,” he said, “is nothing
 more than a mixture of foul-smelling
1328𓀴gases, one of which is
 slightly phosphorescent.
 This mixture, as you
1329𓀴will observe, is
 visible in the dark
 but invisible in the light. The gas
1330𓀴is imprisoned in
 small, thin globes
 of ice which shatter when they
1331𓀴strike the rug, and
 melt in a few seconds,
 leaving no trace other than a
1332𓀴few drops of water which quickly
 evaporate or are absorbed by the rug
1333𓀴fibres. These globes are kept in
 a small refrigeration plant which is
1334𓀴just above my head, and which is
 probably quite thoroughly insulated
1335𓀴against heat. The intense cold in
 this plant is produced by a substance
1336𓀴which is not new to science, but
 the use of which for this particular
1337𓀴purpose is quite
 new. The substance
 is frozen CO₂ or carbon dioxide, and
1338𓀴when expanded into
 a gas it is identical
 with the substance that gives
1339𓀴zest to soda water
 and bottled beverages.
 It has a temperature of 114°
1340𓀴below zero, Fahrenheit,
 and evaporates
 to a dry gas without going
1341𓀴through the intermediate
 liquid state
 with which we are familiar in most
1342𓀴substances.
1343𓀴
1344𓀴“The cold air and gas
 from this refrigerating
 chamber, when propelled
1345𓀴into the room by small, noiseless
 fans through others of these hinged
1346𓀴openings which do not contain the
 gas balls, creates the phenomenon of
1347𓀴the icy breath.
 It can also create
 the illusion of a light touch from a
1348𓀴cold hand, as I have
 proved experimentally.
 The slight breeze moving the
1349𓀴small hairs on one’s
 hand or arm gives
 the sensation of one having been
1350𓀴lightly touched
 while the coldness
 of the breeze makes it appear that
1351𓀴one has been touched by something
 cold. The closet, in which I came so
1352𓀴near being asphyxiated and frozen
 to death, is equipped with a similar
1353𓀴refrigeration plant,
 and it is probable
 that we shall find more of them
1354𓀴which have not been
 used, in other rooms.
1355𓀴
1356𓀴                  *    
   *       *       *       *
1357𓀴
1358𓀴“The matter of the
 lights going out
 and again being turned on will be
1359𓀴settled as soon
 as we can find the
 radio-controlled rheostat and switch
1360𓀴which operates them.
 Is everything clear?”
1361𓀴
1362𓀴“You have not explained
 what it was
 which drove my dog mad,” Miss Van
1363𓀴Loan reminded him.
1364𓀴
1365𓀴“Your dog,” he said,
 “had hydrophobia.
 As I found a bottle of the virus
1366𓀴which produces this
 disease in the
 house occupied by Mr. Hegel, I don’t
1367𓀴think it at all
 remarkable that the
 dog was infected. No doubt it was
1368𓀴acquainted with and friendly
 toward your cousin, who found an
1369𓀴opportunity to inoculate it when
 it was ranging on your estate. The
1370𓀴queer behavior of
 the dog, thereafter,
 is common to all animals that
1371𓀴contract the disease.
 In my opinion
 the dog was inoculated three or four
1372𓀴days ago. It would certainly have
 died within a few hours, had you not
1373𓀴shot it when you did.”
1374𓀴
1375𓀴“What I cannot understand,”
 said Mr.
 Brandon, the electrical engineer,
1376𓀴“is how Mr. Hegel found the time
 or opportunity to install this
1377𓀴complicated array of
 electrical equipment.
 Mr. Van Loan, I understand,
1378𓀴had only been dead a little
 more than a month.”
1379𓀴
1380𓀴“I made a few investigations
 today
 which cleared up that point,” replied
1381𓀴the doctor. “It is
 a matter of common
 knowledge that Gordon Van Loan
1382𓀴died from cancer
 of the stomach. Mr.
 Van Loan was not aware that he had
1383𓀴this disease, although
 both his niece
 and nephew had been apprised of
1384𓀴the fact nearly a year before his
 death by the family physician. They
1385𓀴had also been informed
 that an operation
 would be fruitless and fatal,
1386𓀴and were told almost
 to the day just
 how long their uncle would live.
1387𓀴
1388𓀴“Last winter, in
 the vain hope that
 he might better his condition,
1389𓀴Gordon Van Loan
 went to Florida for
 a three months’ stay, taking his two
1390𓀴servants with him.
 Some time before,
 the nephew had left in a huff after
1391𓀴Mr. Van Loan, in a fit of anger,
 had disclosed to him the contents of
1392𓀴the will he had made.
 Being in possession
 both of the knowledge of the
1393𓀴will and the probable
 length of time
 his uncle would live, Hegel laid
1394𓀴his plans for winning the estate.
 Just before Mr. Van Loan left for
1395𓀴Florida, he visited
 him, saying that
 he was out of a job and penniless,
1396𓀴and asking that he might
 be given something
 to do in order that he might
1397𓀴earn some money.
 The house was badly
 in need of cleaning and decorating,
1398𓀴and, as he had good taste in this
 line, he was permitted to oversee the
1399𓀴work of papering, painting,
 and varnishing
 while his uncle was away,
1400𓀴asking in return
 only a very small
 salary and the privilege of rooming
1401𓀴in the house. His
 uncle turned over
 the keys of the house to him, paid
1402𓀴him his salary in advance, and
 established credit with a firm of
1403𓀴decorators.
1404𓀴
1405𓀴“Hegel’s supposed trip to Europe
 was, of course, only a blind to hide
1406𓀴his recent operations here.
 Are there any more questions?”
1407𓀴
1408𓀴“Yes,” said Mr. Easton. “Now that
 Hegel has been apprehended, what can
1409𓀴the law do with him? What charges
 can be placed against him?”
1410𓀴
1411𓀴“He will be charged with robbery,
 resisting an officer, and attempted
1412𓀴murder. You see he
 robbed a radio and
 camera shop after stealing a small
1413𓀴truck, in order to
 get equipment for
 this elaborate installation, which
1414𓀴his slender means
 would not permit
 him to buy. A police officer on night
1415𓀴duty saw him just
 as he was leaving
 the shop, but Hegel wounded him with
1416𓀴a revolver shot, and escaped. As
 he left fingerprints, and the stolen
1417𓀴articles will be
 easy to identify,
 there is no possible way for him to
1418𓀴escape final and
 certain conviction.”

1482𓀴destroy all copies
 of Project Gutenberg™

 Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
1492𓀴even without complying with the

1513𓀴you share it without

1514𓀴
1515𓀴1.D. The copyright

 Mission of Project Gutenberg™
1695𓀴
1696𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous
 with the free distribution of
1697𓀴electronic works
 in formats readable
 by the widest variety of
1698𓀴computers including
 obsolete, old,
 middle-aged and new computers. It
1699𓀴exists because of the efforts of
 hundreds of volunteers and donations
1700𓀴from people in all walks of life.
1701𓀴
1702𓀴Volunteers and financial support
 to provide volunteers with the
1703𓀴assistance they need are critical
 to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
1704𓀴goals and ensuring
 that the Project
 Gutenberg™ collection will
1705𓀴remain freely available
 for generations
 to come. In 2001, the Project
1706𓀴Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation
 was created to provide a secure
1707𓀴and permanent future for Project
 Gutenberg™ and future
1708𓀴generations. To learn more about

 about Donations
 to the Project Gutenberg
1728𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
1729𓀴
1730𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 depends upon and
 cannot survive without widespread
1731𓀴public support and donations
 to carry out its mission of
1732𓀴increasing the number
 of public domain
 and licensed works that can be
1733𓀴freely distributed
 in machine-readable
 form accessible by the widest
1734𓀴array of equipment
 including outdated
 equipment. Many small donations
1735𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly
 important to maintaining tax exempt
1736𓀴status with the IRS.
1737𓀴
1738𓀴The Foundation is committed to
 complying with the laws regulating
1739𓀴charities and charitable
 donations
 in all 50 states of the United
1740𓀴States. Compliance requirements
 are not uniform and it takes a
1741𓀴considerable effort,
 much paperwork
 and many fees to meet and keep up
1742𓀴with these requirements. We do
 not solicit donations in locations
1743𓀴where we have not
 received written
 confirmation of compliance. To SEND
1744𓀴DONATIONS or determine
 the status of
 compliance for any particular state
1745𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
1746𓀴
1747𓀴While we cannot
 and do not solicit
 contributions from states where we
1748𓀴have not met the solicitation
 requirements,
 we know of no prohibition
1749𓀴against accepting
 unsolicited donations
 from donors in such states who
1750𓀴approach us with
 offers to donate.
1751𓀴
1752𓀴International donations
 are gratefully
 accepted, but we cannot make
1753𓀴any statements concerning
 tax treatment
 of donations received from
1754𓀴outside the United States. U.S.
 laws alone swamp our small staff.
1755𓀴
1756𓀴Please check the

 Information About
 Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
1762𓀴
1763𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was
 the originator of the Project
1764𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library
 of electronic works that could be
1765𓀴freely shared with anyone. For
 forty years, he produced and
1766𓀴distributed Project
 Gutenberg™ eBooks
 with only a loose network of
1767𓀴volunteer support.
1768𓀴
1769𓀴Project Gutenberg™
 eBooks are often
 created from several printed
1770𓀴editions, all of
 which are confirmed
 as not protected by copyright in
1771𓀴the U.S. unless
 a copyright notice
 is included. Thus, we do not
1772𓀴necessarily keep
 eBooks in compliance
 with any particular paper
1773𓀴edition.
