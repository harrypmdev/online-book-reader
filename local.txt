24𓀴A Modest Proposal
25𓀴
26𓀴For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,
27𓀴from being a burden on their parents or country,
28𓀴and for making them beneficial to the publick.

36𓀴
37𓀴It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,
38𓀴or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and
39𓀴cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,
40𓀴four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for
41𓀴an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest
42𓀴livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg
43𓀴sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn
44𓀴thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
45𓀴for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.
46𓀴
47𓀴I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of
48𓀴children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their
49𓀴mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable
50𓀴state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore
51𓀴whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these
52𓀴children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so
53𓀴well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of
54𓀴the nation.
55𓀴
56𓀴But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for
57𓀴the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and
58𓀴shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are
59𓀴born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who
60𓀴demand our charity in the streets.
61𓀴
62𓀴As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
63𓀴important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our
64𓀴projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their
65𓀴computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be
66𓀴supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:
67𓀴at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may
68𓀴certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of
69𓀴begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide
70𓀴for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their
71𓀴parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of
72𓀴their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding,
73𓀴and partly to the clothing of many thousands.
74𓀴
75𓀴There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will
76𓀴prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women
77𓀴murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,
78𓀴sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence
79𓀴than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and
80𓀴inhuman breast.
81𓀴
82𓀴The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million
83𓀴and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred
84𓀴thousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract
85𓀴thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children,
86𓀴(although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present
87𓀴distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a
88𓀴hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand,
89𓀴for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or
90𓀴disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty
91𓀴thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore
92𓀴is, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have
93𓀴already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly
94𓀴impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither
95𓀴employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I
96𓀴mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a
97𓀴livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where
98𓀴they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments
99𓀴much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked
100𓀴upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal
101𓀴gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never
102𓀴knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of
103𓀴the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.
104𓀴
105𓀴I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve
106𓀴years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this
107𓀴age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a
108𓀴crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to
109𓀴the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been
110𓀴at least four times that value.
111𓀴
112𓀴I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will
113𓀴not be liable to the least objection.
114𓀴
115𓀴I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in
116𓀴London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a
117𓀴most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,
118𓀴baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a
119𓀴fricasee, or a ragoust.
120𓀴
121𓀴I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the
122𓀴hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand
123𓀴may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;
124𓀴which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my
125𓀴reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a
126𓀴circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will
127𓀴be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred
128𓀴thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of
129𓀴quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to
130𓀴let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them
131𓀴plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an
132𓀴entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or
133𓀴hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little
134𓀴pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially
135𓀴in winter.
136𓀴
137𓀴I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12
138𓀴pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28
139𓀴pounds.
140𓀴
141𓀴I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for
142𓀴landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem
143𓀴to have the best title to the children.
144𓀴
145𓀴Infant’s flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more
146𓀴plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a
147𓀴grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick
148𓀴dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about
149𓀴nine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning
150𓀴a year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because
151𓀴the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,
152𓀴and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening
153𓀴the number of Papists among us.
154𓀴
155𓀴I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar’s child (in
156𓀴which list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the
157𓀴farmers) to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I
158𓀴believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass
159𓀴of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of
160𓀴excellent nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or
161𓀴his own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a
162𓀴good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have
163𓀴eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces
164𓀴another child.
165𓀴
166𓀴Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may
167𓀴flay the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make
168𓀴admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.
169𓀴
170𓀴As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose,
171𓀴in the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will
172𓀴not be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive,
173𓀴and dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.
174𓀴
175𓀴A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I
176𓀴highly esteem, was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter, to
177𓀴offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this
178𓀴kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the
179𓀴want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and
180𓀴maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so
181𓀴great a number of both sexes in every county being now ready to starve
182𓀴for want of work and service: and these to be disposed of by their
183𓀴parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due
184𓀴deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I
185𓀴cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my
186𓀴American acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their
187𓀴flesh was generally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by
188𓀴continual exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them
189𓀴would not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think,
190𓀴with humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon
191𓀴would become breeders themselves: and besides, it is not improbable
192𓀴that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice,
193𓀴(although indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty,
194𓀴which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection
195𓀴against any project, how well soever intended.
196𓀴
197𓀴But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient
198𓀴was put into his head by the famous Psalmanaazor, a native of the
199𓀴island Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago,
200𓀴and in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young
201𓀴person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to
202𓀴persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body
203𓀴of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison
204𓀴the Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty’s prime minister of
205𓀴state, and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the
206𓀴gibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the
207𓀴same use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who
208𓀴without one single groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without
209𓀴a chair, and appear at a playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries
210𓀴which they never will pay for, the kingdom would not be the worse.
211𓀴
212𓀴Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that
213𓀴vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I
214𓀴have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to
215𓀴ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the
216𓀴least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they
217𓀴are every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and
218𓀴vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young
219𓀴labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot
220𓀴get work, and consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a
221𓀴degree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common
222𓀴labour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and
223𓀴themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come.
224𓀴
225𓀴I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I
226𓀴think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and
227𓀴many, as well as of the highest importance.
228𓀴
229𓀴For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the
230𓀴number of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal
231𓀴breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who
232𓀴stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the
233𓀴Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many
234𓀴good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than
235𓀴stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal
236𓀴curate.
237𓀴
238𓀴Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,
239𓀴which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their
240𓀴landlord’s rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money
241𓀴a thing unknown.
242𓀴
243𓀴Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of a hundred thousand children, from
244𓀴two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten
245𓀴shillings a piece per annum, the nation’s stock will be thereby
246𓀴encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new
247𓀴dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the
248𓀴kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate
249𓀴among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and
250𓀴manufacture.
251𓀴
252𓀴Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings
253𓀴sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the
254𓀴charge of maintaining them after the first year.
255𓀴
256𓀴Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where
257𓀴the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best
258𓀴receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their
259𓀴houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value
260𓀴themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who
261𓀴understands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as
262𓀴expensive as they please.
263𓀴
264𓀴Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise
265𓀴nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and
266𓀴penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards
267𓀴their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the
268𓀴poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual
269𓀴profit instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among
270𓀴the married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the
271𓀴market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of
272𓀴their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in
273𓀴calf, or sows when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick
274𓀴them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.
275𓀴
276𓀴Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition
277𓀴of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel’d beef: the
278𓀴propagation of swine’s flesh, and improvement in the art of making good
279𓀴bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too
280𓀴frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or
281𓀴magnificence to a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole
282𓀴will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor’s feast, or any other
283𓀴publick entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being
284𓀴studious of brevity.
285𓀴
286𓀴Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant
287𓀴customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry
288𓀴meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that
289𓀴Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the
290𓀴rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)
291𓀴the remaining eighty thousand.
292𓀴
293𓀴I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against
294𓀴this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people
295𓀴will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and
296𓀴was indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire
297𓀴the reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one
298𓀴individual Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or,
299𓀴I think, ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of
300𓀴other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of
301𓀴using neither clothes, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our
302𓀴own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and
303𓀴instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of
304𓀴pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein
305𓀴of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country,
306𓀴wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of
307𓀴Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any
308𓀴longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment
309𓀴their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our
310𓀴country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at
311𓀴least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a
312𓀴spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shopkeepers, who, if a
313𓀴resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would
314𓀴immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure,
315𓀴and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair
316𓀴proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.
317𓀴
318𓀴Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like
319𓀴expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will
320𓀴ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.
321𓀴
322𓀴But, as to myself, having been wearied out for many years with offering
323𓀴vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of
324𓀴success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly
325𓀴new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little
326𓀴trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in
327𓀴disobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear
328𓀴exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a
329𓀴long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country,
330𓀴which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.
331𓀴
332𓀴After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject
333𓀴any offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent,
334𓀴cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be
335𓀴advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire
336𓀴the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points.
337𓀴First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and
338𓀴raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly,
339𓀴There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout
340𓀴this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would
341𓀴leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are
342𓀴beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers,
343𓀴with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire
344𓀴those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold
345𓀴to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
346𓀴mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness
347𓀴to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe,
348𓀴and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they
349𓀴have since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the
350𓀴impossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common
351𓀴sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the
352𓀴inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of
353𓀴intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever.
354𓀴
355𓀴I profess in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least
356𓀴personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work,
357𓀴having no other motive than the publick good of my country, by
358𓀴advancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and
359𓀴giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can
360𓀴propose to get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and
361𓀴my wife past child-bearing.

410𓀴electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
411𓀴and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
412𓀴(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
413𓀴the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
414𓀴destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
415𓀴possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

417𓀴by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
418𓀴or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
419𓀴
420𓀴1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
421𓀴used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
422𓀴agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
423𓀴things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
424𓀴even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
425𓀴paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
426𓀴Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
427𓀴agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
428𓀴electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
429𓀴
430𓀴1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
431𓀴Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
432𓀴of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
433𓀴works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
434𓀴States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
435𓀴United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
436𓀴claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
437𓀴displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
438𓀴all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
439𓀴that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
440𓀴free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
441𓀴works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
442𓀴Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
443𓀴comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
444𓀴same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
445𓀴you share it without charge with others.
446𓀴
447𓀴1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
448𓀴what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
449𓀴in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
450𓀴check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
451𓀴agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
452𓀴distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
453𓀴other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

507𓀴other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official

518𓀴
519𓀴1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
520𓀴access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

522𓀴
523𓀴    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
524𓀴        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
525𓀴        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
526𓀴        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
527𓀴        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
528𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
529𓀴        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

532𓀴        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
533𓀴        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
534𓀴        Literary Archive Foundation.”
535𓀴
536𓀴    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
537𓀴        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
538𓀴        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
539𓀴        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
540𓀴        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
541𓀴        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
542𓀴        works.
543𓀴
544𓀴    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

547𓀴        receipt of the work.
548𓀴

563𓀴effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
564𓀴works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
565𓀴Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
566𓀴electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
567𓀴contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
568𓀴or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
569𓀴intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

573𓀴1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
574𓀴of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
575𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

579𓀴fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
580𓀴LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
581𓀴PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
582𓀴TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
583𓀴LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
584𓀴INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
585𓀴DAMAGE.
586𓀴
587𓀴1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
588𓀴defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
589𓀴receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
590𓀴written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
591𓀴received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
592𓀴with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
593𓀴with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
594𓀴lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
595𓀴or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
596𓀴opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
597𓀴the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
598𓀴without further opportunities to fix the problem.
599𓀴
600𓀴1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

605𓀴1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
606𓀴warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
607𓀴damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
608𓀴violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
609𓀴agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
610𓀴limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
611𓀴unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
612𓀴remaining provisions.
613𓀴
614𓀴1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
615𓀴trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
616𓀴providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
617𓀴accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
618𓀴production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
619𓀴electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
620𓀴including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
621𓀴the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
622𓀴or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
623𓀴additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
624𓀴Defect you cause.
625𓀴
626𓀴Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
627𓀴
628𓀴Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
629𓀴electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
630𓀴computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
631𓀴exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
632𓀴from people in all walks of life.
633𓀴
634𓀴Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
635𓀴assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
636𓀴goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
637𓀴remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
638𓀴Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
639𓀴and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
640𓀴generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
641𓀴Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
642𓀴Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
643𓀴
644𓀴Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
645𓀴
646𓀴The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
647𓀴501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
648𓀴state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
649𓀴Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
650𓀴number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
651𓀴Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
652𓀴U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
653𓀴
654𓀴The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
655𓀴Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
656𓀴to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
657𓀴and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
658𓀴
659𓀴Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
660𓀴Literary Archive Foundation
661𓀴
662𓀴Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
663𓀴public support and donations to carry out its mission of
664𓀴increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
665𓀴freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
666𓀴array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
667𓀴($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
668𓀴status with the IRS.
669𓀴
670𓀴The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
671𓀴charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
672𓀴States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
673𓀴considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
674𓀴with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
675𓀴where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
676𓀴DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
677𓀴visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
678𓀴
679𓀴While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
680𓀴have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
681𓀴against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
682𓀴approach us with offers to donate.
683𓀴
684𓀴International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
685𓀴any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
686𓀴outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
687𓀴
688𓀴Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
689𓀴methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
690𓀴ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
691𓀴donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

693𓀴Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
694𓀴
695𓀴Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
696𓀴Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
697𓀴freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
698𓀴distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
699𓀴volunteer support.
700𓀴
701𓀴Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
702𓀴editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
703𓀴the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
704𓀴necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
705𓀴edition.
706𓀴
707𓀴Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
708𓀴facility: www.gutenberg.org.
709𓀴
710𓀴This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
711𓀴including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
712𓀴Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
713𓀴subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
