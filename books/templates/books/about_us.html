                    OnlineBookReader is a site for reading books. Provide us with a link to a text file, and we will split it
                    into easily digestable pages. We'll save your current books, and keep track of your reading position.
                    <br><br>
                    OnlineBookReader does not provide books, we simply present them. The best place to find free, well-formatted 
                    books in the public domain is
                    <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>, a site designed
                    with the mission statement of making public domain books easily accessible - our site was designed
                    with these books in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    OnlineBookReader is not designed for books outside of the public domain, and encourages all users to check
                    they are complying with their country's copyright law at all times. OnlineBookReader does not filter hate speech
                    or adult language from books, so choose books at your own discretion and risk.
